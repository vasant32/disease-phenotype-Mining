We describe three patients with acquired aplastic anemia showing dependency on androgens, with blood counts that correlated directly with variation in oxymetholone dosage. In two of the patients, red cells, neutrophils and platelets showed parallel fluctuations, whereas in one patient the red cells and white cells, but not the platelets, fluctuated in relationship to oxymetholone therapy. There was no hematologic response to dromostanolone in two patients. These results support the benefit of androgen therapy in some patients with acquired aplastic anemia.
