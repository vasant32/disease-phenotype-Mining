 OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of Fuzhengyangying granules (FZYYG) on the expression of the bone marrow proliferation and bcl-2 in mice with immune mediated aplastic anemia. METHODS: Forty BALB/c mice were randomly allocated to 4 groups: a normal control group, a model group, cyclosporine A (CSA) group and FZYYG group. The model group was fed with physical salt, while the CSA and FZYYG group were fed with CSA and FZYYG respectively, and then the changes of peripheral hemoglobin (Hb), platelet, bone marrow nucleus cell (BMNC), bone marrow hematopoiesis tissue volume and bcl-2 expression were examined. RESULTS: The count of Hb, the platelet, BMNC, the bone marrow hematopoiesis tissue volume and the bcl-2 positive rate in the model group were lower than those in the normal group (P<0.05), whereas the count of Hb, the platelet, BMNC, the bone marrow hematopoiesis tissue volume and the bcl-2 positive rate in both CAS and FZYYG groups were significantly higher than those in the model group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: FZYYG can induce the bcl-2 antigen expression and postpone the haematogenous cells apoptosis, and it is effective for mice with immune mediated aplastic anemia.
