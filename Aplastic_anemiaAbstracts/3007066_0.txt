Bone marrow transplantations were performed on 15 patients (aged 5-39 years) with severe aplastic anaemia. Twelve patients are alive 76-1930 days (median 668 d) after transplantation, with complete haematopoetic recovery. Total-body radiation with 3.6 Gy in four patients, cyclosporin A administration to ten patients and buffy-coat transfusion to nine patients entirely prevented early rejection. Two patients died of pneumonia (aspergillus; varicella-zoster virus), one patient died of bleeding from a splenic-artery aneurysm. In patients under the age of 40 years with severe aplastic anaemia bone marrow transplantation as early as possible after diagnosis is the treatment of choice if HLA-identical siblings are available as donors. In patients over 40 years treatment should at first be tried with antithymocyte globulin.
