The results of unrelated bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is poor because of the rejection of bone marrow graft and graft versus host disease (GVHD). However, the rate of rejection has been reported to be decreased by intensive immuno-suppressive preconditioning regimens combined with total body irradiation (TBI). We report a case of an 18-year-old male with severe aplastic anemia who received a matched BMT from an unrelated donor. The pre-conditioning regimen included cyclophosphamide (50mg/kg) for 4 days, total lymphoid irradiation (TLI: 6Gy) and TBI (5Gy). GVHD (grade 1), hemorrhage cystitis and varicella occurred after BMT but were cured. His performance status is now 100% on the Karnofsky score at 10 months after BMT.
