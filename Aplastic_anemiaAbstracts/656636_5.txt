Our resent experience on six cases of aplastic anemia complicated with pregnancy is described. In addition, 43 similar cases were collected from the literature and reviewed to analyze some prognostic aspects of this relatively rare but potentially serious complication. Clinical and hematological data were treated to extract some clinically meaningful factors in relation to the success and failure of pregnancy. Among initial hematological parameters, no significant difference was found between successful and unsuccessful cases with an exception of hemoglobin concentration. The patients diagnosed as aplastic anemia prior to conception demonstrated an better outcome of pregnancy as well as survival rate of mother when compared with those diagnosed during pregnancy. Mortality has apparently improved after the late 1950's. Success rate of pregnancy before 1958 was 21%, while it was 67% and 71% in the era of 1959-1969 and after 1970, respectively. However, hemorrhage and infection remained to be two major causes of maternal death in both eras. Based on these observations, the currently recommendable attitude to this complication is discussed.
