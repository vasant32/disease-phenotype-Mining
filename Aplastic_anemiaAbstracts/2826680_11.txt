The incidence and the outcome of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections were evaluated in 83 adult recipients of allogenic bone marrow transplantation. Virological and serological surveillance was performed weekly for 3 months posttransplant, and then every other week or every month until 1 year. CMV infection occurred in 45 patients, with a cumulative risk of 62% at 1 year and 66% at 2 years. In multivariate analysis, two factors significantly influenced the incidence of CMV infection: patients with pretransplant positive anti-CMV titres had a risk of infection of 72% at 1 year versus 33% for patients with negative titres. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia were also infected more frequently (85% at 1 year) than patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (56%), chronic granulocytic leukemia (45%), or aplastic anemia (47%). In both univariate and multivariate analysis, CMV infection was not associated with a worse prognosis. However, 5 (out of 10) cases of lethal interstitial pneumonitis were associated with CMV, and two patients died of possible CMV encephalitis. All these patients had been suffering from severe acute or chronic graft versus host disease.
