Dyskeratosis congenita is a congenital multisystem disorder, characterized by skin pigmentation, dystrophic nails, and leukoplakia. Hematologic abnormalities progressing to severe pancytopenia play a significant role in the poor prognosis of afflicted patients. We report on a patient with dyskeratosis congenita and severe aplastic anemia, complicated by life threatening infection. The patient was treated with recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. This therapy resulted in a moderate and transient improvement in absolute neutrophil counts. Current concepts regarding the pathogenesis and etiology of dyskeratosis congenita are discussed, while reviewing the available therapeutic options.
