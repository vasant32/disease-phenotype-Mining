Dengue fever has rarely been reported as an etiology for aplastic anemia. An 8-year-old girl was admitted with fever, myalgia and petechiae. Dengue virus IgM antibodies were positive. She recovered completely, but her thrombocytopenia persisted. Six weeks later she became pancytopenic. A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy showed severe aplastic anemia. She was treated with antithymocytic immunoglobulin, methylprednisolone and cyclosporine. She became transfusion independent 6 months later. Dengue-virus induced aplastic anemia is a rare entity, but it must be identified early for better outcome. Immunosuppressive therapy can induce remission.
