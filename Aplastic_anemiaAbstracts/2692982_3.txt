In a prospective, randomized study we compared ceftriaxone (active ingredient of Rocephin) plus amikacin, ceftazidime plus amikacin and imipenem/cilastatin in the empiric therapy of febrile granulocytopenic (less than 500/mm3) patients with cancer or aplastic anemia. Of 27 evaluable episodes, 12 were treated with ceftriaxone plus amikacin, 5 with ceftazidime plus amikacin and 10 with imipenem/cilastatin. 56% were culture-positive. Septicemia was the most frequent site of infection and Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated organism. The efficacy of the three regimens was comparable. One failure occurring in each treatment group was successfully treated with an alternative antibiotic regimen. A second failure in the first treatment group did not respond to the alternative treatment either. No major adverse effects occurred. This study demonstrates that the three regimens are excellent in the empiric therapy of febrile granulocytopenic patients.
