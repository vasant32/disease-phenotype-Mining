The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of brucine on secretion of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-4 and proliferation of T lymphocytes in patients with aplastic anemia (AA), and to explore its mechanism. Peripheral blood T lymphocytes from 10 patients with AA and 10 healthy volunteers were isolated, purified and cultured. T lymphocytes from the patients were divided into 0, 100, 200 and 400 µg/ml brucine-treated groups. T lymphocytes from healthy volunteers were used as control group. After being cultured for 72 hours, the levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-4 in the supernatant of cultured T lymphocytes from AA patients were detected by ELISA, and the proliferation of T lymphocytes from AA patients was detected by MTT. The results showed that compared with the normal control group, the levels of TNF-α and IFN-γ in the culture supernatant significantly increased, and IL-4 was significantly decreased. The levels of TNF-α and IFN-γ in the culture supernatant of brucine treated groups were lower, and were dependent on the concentration of brucine. However, the levels of IL-4 were found to be not obviously changed. The inhibition rate of T lymphocytes in 100, 200 and 400µg/ml brucine-treated groups were (13.61 ± 4.31)%, (14.28 ± 4.31)% and (15.12 ± 4.56)% respectively, among which the differences were not statistically significant. It is concluded that the brucine can reduce the levels of TNF-α and IFN-γ through inhibiting the proliferation of T lymphocytes in AA patients, which provides experimental basis for therapy of AA patients.
