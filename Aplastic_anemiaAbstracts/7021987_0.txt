Patient survival after BMT is directly correlated with the HLA-type of the donor. The survival rate after BMT from an HLA-genotypically identical sibling is 56% in acute leukemia, 55% in combined severe immunodeficiency disease (SCID) and 67/83% in severe aplastic anemia patients. The usage of only HLA-D identical related or unrelated donors in SCID revealed a 37% survival, compared to 18% survival in acute leukemia and 11% in severe aplastic anemia using HLA-phenotypical identical or HLA-D identical related donors. BMT from HLA-phenotypical and MLC identical unrelated donors resulted in death of the grafted patients. Non of the patients grafted with HLA-different marrow survived BMT. Survival of BMT patients depended beside the histocompatibility matching on the clinical treatment and the clinical constellation of the patient: The survival rate decreased in aplastic anemia patients due to sensibilisation caused by pre-BMT blood transfusion and was significantly higher in leukemia when BMT was performed in remission.
