INTRODUCTION: The Imerslund-Gr√§sbeck syndrome is a rare hereditary autosomal recessive disease, characterized by the onset of megaloblastic anemia and asymptomatic proteinuria during the first 2 years of life. OBJECTIVE: To emphasize the importance of early detection of this disorder, due to high morbidity when not correctly treated, in addition to the necessity of screening and genetic counseling of the asymptomatic family members. METHODS: The authors report two patients, male and female, 8 and 10 years old, respectively. Their past history revealed anemia and multiple blood transfusions since their infancy. They evolved with pancytopenia during childhood and diagnosis of Severe Aplastic Anemia or Fanconi Syndrome was suspected. They were referred to the Bone Marrow Transplantation Section -HC- UFPR. RESULTS: Laboratory investigations revealed pancytopenia in peripheral blood. Bone marrow aspiration showed a marked megaloblastic erythropoiesis. Twenty-four-hour urine collection revealed proteinuria (3.0 and 5.8 g/dl respectively). Cytogenetic analysis was normal. Resolution of symptoms followed replacement therapy with parenteral vitamin B12. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of megaloblastic anemia in children should be followed by investigation of proteinuria, due to the existence of this rare disorder, that has a simple diagnosis and an effective treatment.
