Prompted by previous reports that in certain patients with aplastic anemia, cell-mediated autoimmune suppression of myeloid stem cell proliferation may be demonstrable in vitro, we studied the effects of bone marrow lymphocytes from 18 patients with myeloid aplasia on the proliferation of committed granulocytic-monocytic progenitor cells (CFU-C). When assayed in soft agar cultures, marrow suspensions from 10 patients with aplastic anemia contained significantly fewer viable CFU-C than similar cell preparations from control subjects. To deplete marrow cell suspensions of lymphocytes, we employed rabbit anti-human thymocyte serum (ATS), which after multiple adsorptions exhibited marked cytotoxicity for human B and T lymphocytes but had negligible effect on normal CFU-C proliferation. Preincubation of marrow samples from 12 patients with ATS and complement resulted in no inhibition or enhancement of CFU-C growth. In further experiments, marrow cells from 8 patients were incubated with marrow from control subjects prior to CFU-C culture. No suppression of donor CFU-C proliferation was observed in any of these studies, and in 4 cocultures, mixture of the 2 marrow suspensions resulted in stimulation of CFU-C growth. Using these assays, we detected no evidence of cell-mediated inhibition of CFU-C proliferation in any of the 18 patients that we evaluated. Our data support the conclusion that in the majority of patients with aplastic anemia, an absolute deficiency of hemopoietic stem cells is present within the marrow that does not appear to be effected or sustained by suppressor lymphocytes. Whether the reduction of viable stem cells is the cause or the consequence of the process that leads to marrow failure remains unknown.
