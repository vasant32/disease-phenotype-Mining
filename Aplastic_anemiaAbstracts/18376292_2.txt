We report 2 pediatric cases of cerebral fungal infection. A patient with severe aplastic anemia developed an Aspergillus species brain abscess and pulmonary aspergillosis after peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Despite administration of micafungin, amphotericin B, and flucytosine, the patient died 2 months after the transplantation because of underlying pulmonary aspergillosis. Another patient with acute myelogenous leukemia developed a huge brain abscess with histopathologic findings suspicious of mucormycosis. This patient was cured with combination therapy of antifungal agents and intensive surgery, without sequelae. It is important to perform aggressive multimodality treatment, when indicated, including surgical intervention, even if in myelosuppression.
