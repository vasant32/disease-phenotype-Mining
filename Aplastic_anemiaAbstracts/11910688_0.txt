Bone marrow transplantation from HLA-identical sibling offers cure and leads to restoration of normal hematopoiesis and long-term survival in 60-80% of recipients. From february 1998 to october 1999, seven patients with aplastic anemia (2 very severe aplastic anemia and 5 severe aplastic anemia), with a median age of 22 years (14-39), received a transplant from an HLA-identical sibling donor. All patients had sustained engraftment. Only one patient developed grade IV acute graft-versus-host disease. One patient died in the 22th day of systemic mycobacterial infection and one in the 79th day of acute graft-versus-host disease. The remaining 5 patients are alive and have a complete hematological recovery, with a median follow-up of 6 months (1,5-12). There are at least two reasons for the improved survival of patients with aplastic anemia who where treated by HLA-indentical bone marrow transplantation. One is the decreased incidence of graft rejection that has resulted from the more judicious use of transfusions before bone marrow transplantation, and improvements in the immunosuppressive qualities of the conditioning programs. Another reason for improved survival is the decrease in the incidence and severity of acute graft-versus-host disease.
