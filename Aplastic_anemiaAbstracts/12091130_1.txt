We report a positive association between HLA-DRB1*15 (p= 0.0002) in Turkish patients with pediatric severe aplastic anemia (SAA) and a paradoxically favorable influence of the susceptibility marker on the clinical response to immunosuppressive therapy. These findings point to an immune mechanism mediated by DRB1*15 in SAA which confers responsiveness to treatment.
