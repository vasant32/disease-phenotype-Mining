We report an invasive mucormycosis caused by Actinomucor elegans in a patient with refractory aplastic anemia. The organism was isolated from a necrotic skin lesion on the patient's left arm and demonstrated angioinvasive features on histopathology examination. In contrast to three cases described previously, we describe the first case of A. elegans invasive fungal infection in an immunocompromised patient. This report, along with the three previously reported cases, is convincing evidence that A. elegans is an emerging fungal pathogen capable of causing invasive mucormycosis in humans.
