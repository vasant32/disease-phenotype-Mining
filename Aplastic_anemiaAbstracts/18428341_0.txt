Cytogenetic analysis of malignant hematological disease is an important methodology used by clinicians and researchers, as observations of clonal chromosomal abnormalities have been shown to have both diagnostic and prognostic significance. The Basic Protocol describes the culture, harvest, and preparation of chromosome spreads from bone marrow aspirates. Five alternate protocols describe adaptations of the Basic Protocol for preparation of specimens from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) bone marrow, leukemic peripheral blood, CLL peripheral blood, post-bone marrow transplant (post-BMT) peripheral blood, and aplastic anemia bone marrow and peripheral blood. The modifications involve slightly different culture and harvest methods that are necessary to assure optimal results.
