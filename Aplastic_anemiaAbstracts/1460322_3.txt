Serum erythropoietin (Epo) titers in patients with various hematological malignancies and related diseases were determined by radioimmunoassay. Serum Epo titer was inversely correlated with hemoglobin concentration in iron deficiency anemia, aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), acute leukemia, malignant lymphoma, multiple myeloma and myelofibrosis, but there was no correlation between serum Epo titer and hemoglobin concentration in chronic myelogenous leukemia or polycythemias. Serum Epo titers in aplastic anemia were much higher than those in iron deficiency anemia. Serum Epo titers in MDS, malignant lymphoma and multiple myeloma differed considerably among patients. Serum Epo titers in untreated polycythemia vera were significantly lower than in treated polycythemia vera or secondary polycythemia.
