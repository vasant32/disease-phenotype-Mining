OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the availability of the treatment of adult severe aplastic anemia with unrelated allo-cord blood stem cell transplantation (CBSCT). METHODS: HLA-matched unrelated cord blood transplantation has been successfully performed for an adult severe aplastic anemia patient. A unit of cord blood provided by Guangzhou Cord Blood Bank containing 1.89 x 10(7)/kg mononucleated cells, 1.8 x 10(4)/kg CFU-GM and of CD(34) positive cells was 0.009. The patient was conditioned with CTX (60 mg/kg) and anti-lymphocyte globulin (ALG, 120 mg/kg). GVHD prophylaxis consisted of both MTX and CsA. The CsA had been given for 8 months. RESULTS: The lowest ANC was 0.6 x 10(9)/L post-transplantation. The patient achieved an ANC of greater than 0.5 x 10(9)/L at 10 days, and the platelet of greater than 50.0 x 10(9)/L at day 20 after transplantation. He developed Grade 1 GVHD in the tenth month after grafting. Microsatellite DNA fingerprinting indicated a stable donor-recipient mixed chimerism, whilst the circulating red cells remained host origin. CONCLUSION: It is the first report in China on successful treatment of adult severe aplastic anemia by unrelated allo-CBSCT.
