Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) C-Sarma (or FSC) is a prototype of subgroup C FeLVs, which induce fatal aplastic anemia in outbred specific-pathogen-free (SPF) cats. FeLV C isolates also possess an extended host range in vitro, including an ability, unique among FeLVs, to replicate in guinea pig cells. To identify the viral determinants responsible for the pathogenicity and host range of FSC we constructed a series of proviral DNAs by exchanging gene fragments between FSC and FeLV-61E (or F6A), the latter of which is minimally pathogenic and whose host range in vitro is restricted to feline cells. Transfer of an 886-base-pair (bp) fragment of FSC, encompassing the codons for 73 amino acids at the 3' end of pol (the integrase/endonuclease gene) and the codons for 241 amino acids of the N-terminal portion of env [the extracellular glycoprotein (gp70) gene], into the F6A genome was sufficient to confer onto chimeric viruses the ability to induce fatal aplastic anemia in SPF cats. In contrast, no chimera lacking this sequence induced disease. When assayed in vitro, all chimeric viruses containing the 886-bp fragment of FSC acquired the ability to replicate in heterologous cells, including dog and guinea pig cells. Thus, the pathogenic and the host range determinants of the feline aplastic anemia retrovirus colocalize to a 3' pol-5' env region of the FSC genome and likely reside within a region encoding 241 amino acid residues of the N terminus of the extracellular glycoprotein.
