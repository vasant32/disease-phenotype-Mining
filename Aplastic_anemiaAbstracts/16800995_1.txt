 OBJECTIVE: To explore the therapy to further elevate the efficacy of the treatment of chronic aplastic anemia (CAA). METHODS: Forty-five patients with CCA were assigned into two groups, the 26 patients in the treated group were treated by Shengxuening (a Chinese herbal preparation) and cyclosporin A (CsA), and the 19 patients in the control group were treated with androgen alone, with the therapeutic course lasting for over 3 months. Changes of peripheral blood picture, and the colony productivity of burst forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E), colony forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) and colony forming unit-granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) in bone marrow were observed before and after 3 months treatment. The amount of erythrocyte and platelet infusion, frequency of infection, condition of hemorrhage and relevant death were also observed. The follow-up study was conducted for over half a year. RESULTS: The total effective rate in the treated group was 84.6%, which was significantly higher than that in the control group (52.6%, P < 0.05). Levels of hemoglobin, reticulocyte, neutrophil and platelet increased after treatment in the treated group, as compared with those before treatment, with significant difference (P < 0.05), and the colony productivity of BFU-E, CFU-E and CFU-GM in bone marrow also got significantly increased (P < 0.01), and showed significant difference from those in the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Shengxuening-assisting CsA therapy is an effective measure for treatment of CAA.
