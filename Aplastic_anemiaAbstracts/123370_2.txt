The mixed lymphocyte culture tests between one patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia and her mother and between another patient with aplastic anemia and his mother were found nonreactive, despite a one-haplotype difference for HL-A.  Two crossovers in each family at the MLC locus or a specific defect in lymphocyte responsiveness could be possibly explantations.  The mother of each patient could be considered a potential donor for bone marrow transplantation.
