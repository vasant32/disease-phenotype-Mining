 OBJECTIVE: Blood cells from patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria lack glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked proteins, due to a somatic mutation in the X-linked PIGA gene. It is believed that clonal expansion of PIGA- blood cells is due to a survival advantage in the hostile marrow environment of aplastic anemia. Here we investigated the effects of inhibitory cytokines in mice genetically engineered to have blood cells deficient in GPI-linked proteins. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of inhibitory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha], interferon-gamma [IFN-gamma], macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha [MIP-1alpha], and transforming growth factor-beta1 [TGF-beta1]) was investigated, using clonogenic assays, competitive repopulation, and in vivo induction of proinflammatory cytokines by double-stranded RNA. The expression of Fas on progenitor cells and its up-regulation by inhibitory cytokines were analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, MIP-1alpha, and TGF-beta1 suppressed colony formation in a dose-dependent fashion that was similar for PIGA+ and PIGA- blood bone marrow cells. Competitive repopulation of bone marrow cells cultured in IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha resulted in a comparable ability of PIGA+ and PIGA- hematopoietic stem cells to reconstitute hematopoiesis. Fas expression was minimal on PIGA+ and PIGA- progenitor cells and was up-regulated to the same extent in response to IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha as assessed by Fas antibody-mediated apoptosis. Similarly, in vivo induction of proinflammatory cytokines by double-stranded RNA had no effect on the proportion of circulating PIGA- blood cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that PIGA+ and PIGA- hematopoietic progenitor cells respond similarly to inhibitory cytokines, suggesting that other factors are responsible for the clonal expansion of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria cells.
