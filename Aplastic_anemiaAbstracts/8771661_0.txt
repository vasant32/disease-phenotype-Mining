Blood coagulation and rheology were studied with regard to severity of hemorrhagic syndrome and neurological complications in 44 patients with aplastic anemia (AA). Most of these patients appeared to have DIC-syndrome with serious rheological shifts. The patients suffered from hemorrhagic diathesis, nasal and gingival hemorrhages. With AA progression the severity and frequency of hemorrhagic complications increased. Neurological examination revealed in 9 of 12 AA patients organic affections of the nervous system with EEG evidence of bioelectrical shifts. In some patients neurological complications were registered prior to hemorrhagic. Therefore, to diagnose hemorrhagic complications in AA patients it is necessary to assess in details their hemocoagulation, blood rheology and neurological status.
