We reported two patients showed similar clinical course after blood transfusion. Case 1 was 74-year-old female, received transfusion of 200 ml of whole blood from her son, because of hemorrhagic shock for fematemesis from gastric ulcer. After transfusion, she died of liver dysfunction and severe aplastic anemia. Case 2 was a 73-year-old male, received transfusion of three unites of concentrated red blood cells for anemia following the orthopaedic treatment. High fever and erythema was appeared suddenly after transfusion. He died of liver dysfunction and the autopsy was performed. In case 1 the diagnosis was transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and in case 2 drug-induced-aplastic anemia (DIAA) was suspected. Differentiating the diagnosis between GVHD and DIAA is clinically difficult.
