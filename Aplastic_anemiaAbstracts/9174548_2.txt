Primary allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (allo-PBSCT) has not been previously described in the treatment of severe aplastic anemia (SAA). We report a patient with SAA who underwent primary allo-PBSCT with cells from her HLA-identical sibling and achieved rapid bone marrow reconstitution. The patient has been in complete remission with normal blood counts for 9 months following allo-PBSCT. This suggests that primary allo-PBSCT is a safe and effective alternative in the treatment of SAA.
