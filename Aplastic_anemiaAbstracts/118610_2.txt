Fetal liver transplantation was attempted in 7 patients with aplastic anemia. 4 of these patients showed a partial response as evidenced by decrease in blood transfusion requirements and increase in the peripheral blood counts and hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. Bone marrow culture studies revealed evidence of a temporary mixed lymphoid chimerism (cases 1 and 3). While case 1 lived for 16 months, case 3 is surviving at 17 months. None of the patients showed apparent graft-versus-host disease. Increased incidence of infections was noticed. Possible causes for the same are discussed. 3 patients failed to respond. Fetal liver transplant may be of therapeutic value in management of aplastic anemia.
