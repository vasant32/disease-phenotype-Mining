OBJECTIVE: To complete the data on the demographic features of patients diagnosed to have aplastic anemia at a single institution over a 7.5 years period. METHODS: Demographic information was retrieved from the patients medical records retrospectively as well as prospectively of those patients who presented with features of aplastic anaemia. Their diagnosis was confirmed by performing a complete blood count and bone marrow trephine. RESULTS: One hundred and forty four patients were diagnosed to have aplastic anemia; there were 106 males and 38 females. Their ages ranged from 2 to 75 years, with a median of 17 years, 112 (77.7%) patients were below the age of 30 years. Severe aplastic anemia (SAA) was seen in 74 (51.4%), very severe (VSAA) in 24 (16.7%) and non-severe aplastic anemia (NSAA) in 46 (31.9%) patients. No obvious cause could be established for 74.3%. Thirteen patients admitted using drugs known to cause AA and one was a radiographer (9%). Out of 44 patients tested, 7 (15.9%) were found to have either hepatitis B virus markers or antibody to hepatitis C at the time of diagnosis of AA. However it was difficult to establish a cause and effect relationship with either drugs or viruses. CONCLUSION: Aplastic anaemia is found to occur mostly in young males. The most common type was idiopathic severe aplastic anaemia.
