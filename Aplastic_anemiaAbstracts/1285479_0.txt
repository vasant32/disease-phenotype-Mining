Main indications for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation are severe aplastic anemia, severe combined immunodeficiency, acute leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia. In standard risk situations survival rates are 50 to 80%. The probability of disease-free survival after bone marrow transplantation is depending on the stage of disease. If possible bone marrow transplantation should be performed early, not in advanced disease when conventional measures failed. Main problems are therapy-related organ toxicity, rejection, graft-versus-host disease and a long lasting risk of infection. Usually histocompatible relatives of the patients are selected as marrow donors. Bone marrow transplantation using unrelated donors is under investigation. Autologous transplantations with cryopreserved marrow are performed in acute leukemia, malignant lymphomas and some solid tumors, but prospective studies comparing transplantation and conventional therapeutic procedures are still missing.
