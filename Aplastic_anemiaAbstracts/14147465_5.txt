Two examples of hematological toxicity following phenylbutazone therapy are described, one of agranulocytosis and one of aplastic anemia. In the first case, prednisolone in a dosage of 20 mg. daily restored neutrophil percentage and the total leukocyte count to normal, but the patient with aplastic anemia, having shown no response to corticosteroid therapy, became dependent on repeated blood transfusion.The English literature on the hematological toxicity of phenylbutazone is reviewed. Ten fatal cases of agranulocytosis have been recorded, as have eight cases of aplastic anemia, of which five proved fatal. Other toxic effects noted have included leukopenia, depression of erythropoiesis, megaloblastic anemia, thrombocytopenia and leukemia.
