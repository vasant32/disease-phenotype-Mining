AIM: Investigation of the response to antilymphocytic globulin (ALG) and transplantation of allogenic bone marrow (TABM) in patients with a severe form of aplastic anemia (AA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 15 patients were treated for severe AA in 1995-1997. 8 patients of group 1 were given ALG/cyclophosphamide with subsequent TABM from HLA-identical sib donor. To prevent graft versus host reaction the patients took cyclosporin A (CSA) + prednisolone. Those who had no sib donor (7 patients) were treated with ALG/CSA (group 2). RESULTS: A complete remission at 7-30-month follow-up was observed in 6 patients of group 1. One patient died of infectious complications in rejection of the transplant and one patient died of acute graft versus host reaction. None of group 2 patients achieved the remission. One patient died of infectious complications. The others need continuous hemotransfusion therapy. CONCLUSION: In spite of high probability of early complications after TABM, TABM-subjected patients are more likely to achieve a complete remission and recurrence-free survival than those given immunosuppressive therapy alone.
