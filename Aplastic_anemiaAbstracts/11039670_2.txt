We report 2 paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) patients who were initially diagnosed with aplastic anemia and sequentially developed PNH, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and leukemia. Flow cytometry and cytogenetic analysis showed the initial appearance and expansion of PNH clones, gradual replacement of PNH clones by MDS clones with monosomy 7, and then expansion of MDS clones or their subclones with additional chromosomal abnormalities. In relation to these developments, expression increased of the Wilms' tumor gene WT1, a marker for leukemic progression. These patients not only shared bone marrow failure but also might have harbored a hematopoietic environment favorable for the emergence of abnormal clones leading to leukemogenesis.
