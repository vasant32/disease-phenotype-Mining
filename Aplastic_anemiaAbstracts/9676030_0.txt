Transient pancytopenia preceding childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an unfrequent but well-known event. The association of this preleukemic syndrome with hepatitis is extremely rare, with only two such cases having been published in the literature. We report the case of a 16-year-old boy who was diagnosed with B-cell type ALL that was preceded by transient pancytopenia with absent hemopoietic cells in the bone marrow following a seronegative hepatitis episode. The clinical, morphologic and immunophenotypic features of this patient are described and the literature on this preleukemic syndrome reviewed, with special emphasis being made on its differential diagnosis with hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia.
