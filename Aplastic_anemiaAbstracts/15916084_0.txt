Group C streptococci are a common cause of infection in animals and a rare cause of bacteremia in human beings. The entity is often seen in elderly people with a severe underlying illness. We report here the only case of Group C streptococcal bacteremia reported in our hospital, caused by Streptococcus equisimilis, a beta-hemolytic Group C streptococcus. The patient was a 10-year old male with a known history of aplastic anemia. In spite of specific therapy with penicillin, the outcome was fatal.
