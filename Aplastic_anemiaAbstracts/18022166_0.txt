 OBJECTIVE: To discuss an additional option for frozen embryos that can be a life-saving alternative. DESIGN: Case report and literature review. SETTING: Academic fertility center. PATIENT(S): A woman with a previous hysterectomy and frozen embryos who had a daughter afflicted with aplastic anemia. INTERVENTION(S): Four thawed multicell embryos were transfered to the patient's 37-year-old multiparous sister. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Alternative disposition of frozen embryos. RESULT(S): The HLA type of the infant was found to be an exact match for the daughter dying from aplastic anemia. CONCLUSION(S): The use of frozen embryos to prolong an existing individual's life is an additional ethical option to be considered by couples and individuals with cryopreserved embryos.
