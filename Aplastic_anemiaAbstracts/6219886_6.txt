One hundred seventy-five patients with severe aplastic anemia were treated by high-dose cyclophosphamide and HLA-A, -B, and -D-identical sibling marrow transplants. Thirty-eight patients rejected their grafts. Four of the 38 showed autologous marrow recovery as determined by blood genetic markers. The remarkable feature of one case following autologous marrow recovery was the presence of unidirectional proliferative and cytotoxic responses of circulating host lymphocytes to marrow donor lymphocytes in mixed lymphocyte culture and cell-mediated lympholysis. Presumably these responses were the result of in vivo sensitization to those non-HLA antigens for which donor and recipient differed.
