By ways of HPLC and RIA, multiple laboratory parameters were determined simultaneously in 84 patients of iron--deficiency anemia (IDA) or chronic aplastic anemia (CAA) with Liver-Blood Deficiency Syndrome (LBDS) diagnosed by differentiation of TCM. The results showed that LBDS had some pathophysiological characteristics such as decreased function of sympathicus and adrenal medulla axis, increasing of L-EK, lower energy metabolism of erythrocyte, lower rate of body metabolism, sodium and water imbalance, and abnormalities in hemorrheology and erythrocyte deformability. It is suggested that the patients with LBDS are in a state of protective compensation in blood volume regulation.
