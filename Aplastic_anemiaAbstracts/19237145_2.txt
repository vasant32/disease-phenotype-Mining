Aplastic anemia is a medullary insufficiency secondary to the complete or partial disappearance of hematopoietic tissue without abnormal cellular proliferation. This is a rare complication of infections, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever. A 15-year-old girl was admitted with anemia, bleeding from the gums, petechiae and fever. Laboratory tests at the time of admission showed: Hemoglobin 4.8 g/dl; Hematocrit 13.4%; white blood count 2240/microl and platelets 11,500/microl. Dengue virus IgM antibodies were found. A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy showed severe aplastic anemia. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone was started. The patient had a favorable outcome. She was then given long-term treatment with cyclosporin. She is now in remission, without any symptoms. Dengue can induce aplastic anemia through direct bone marrow invasion. This is a rare complication which must be identified early. Immunosuppressive therapy can induce complete remission.
