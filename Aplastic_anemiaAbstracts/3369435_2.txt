Four chloramphenicol (CAP) metabolites known to be produced by intestinal bacteria were examined with respect to their capacity to induce DNA damage in intact cells. The induction of DNA single-strand breaks in Raji cells, activated human lymphocytes, and human marrow cells was assayed by the alkaline elution technique. One of the four compounds tested, dehydro-CAP, was capable of inducing DNA single-strand breaks in all three cell systems at concentrations of 10(-4) M. This effect is comparable to that observed previously with nitroso-CAP, the nitroreduction intermediate of CAP. The nitroreduction of dehydro-CAP by human bone marrow cell homogenate was detected by the production of the corresponding amino derivative amounting to 5.6 X 10(-5) M from 2 X 10(-3) M substrate under aerobic conditions. In sharp contrast, nitroreduction of CAP by bone marrow could not be demonstrated. The genotoxicity of dehydro-CAP, its relative stability compared to the nitroso-CAP, and its nitroreducibility by bone marrow suggest that this bacterial metabolite of CAP may play a key role as a mediator of aplastic anemia in the predisposed host.
