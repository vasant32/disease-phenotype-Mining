 OBJECTIVE: To explore treatment methods for patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) failing in immunosuppressive therapy (IST). METHODS: Totally 62 SAA patients failing in IST were treated by integrative medicine (IM). The treatment course was divided into three stages: the critical emergency stage, the improvement stage, and the recovery stage. In the critical emergency stage, patients were treated with Lingyang Yigui Decoction (LYD, consisting of 1.2 g antelope horn, 6 g coptis chinensis, 12 g stir-baked Fructus Gardeniae, 30 g rehmannia rhizoma, 50 g lalang grass rhizome, 9 g amur corktree bark, 12 g Cortex Moutan, 9 g ass-hide gelatin, 30 g red date, 6 g prepared licorice root, etc.) and Erzhi Busui Decoction (EBD, consisting of 120 g glossy privet fruit, 100 g eclipta prostrata, 24 g prepared Gold Theragran, 12 g fructus lycii, 90 g rehmannia rhizoma, 60 g astragalus, 9 g Angelica sinensis, 9 g ass-hide gelatin, 30 g honeysuckle flower, 12 g lotus plumule, and so on) alternatively, one dose daily, decocted twice, taken in two portions. Meanwhile, 50 mg Testosterone Propionate was intramuscularly injected every other day to the improvement stage. Those with fever were treated with LYD by adding 60 g gypsum, 60 g common anemarrhena, 30 g dandelion, 30 g bittersweet herb, 30 g blackend swallowwort root and rhizome, 15 g hemsley rockvine root tuber, and so on. In the improvement stage patients were treated with Jixueteng Compound (Jixueteng Zhengyang Decoction was administered to those of Shen-yang deficiency syndrome: consisting of 100 g spatholobus suberectus, 60 g astragalus, 3 g red ginseng, 12 g psoralea corylifolia, 18 g dodder seed, 12 g angelica, 18 g Herba Epimedii, 6 g common fenugreek seed, 24 g Gold Theragran, 30 g glossy privet fruit, 30 g eclipta prostrata, 6 g dried human placenta, and so on). Meanwhile, 50 mg Testosterone Propionate was intramuscularly injected every other day. Jixueteng Yijing Decoction was administered to those of Shen-yin deficiency syndrome: consisting of 100 g glossy privet fruit, 100 g eclipta prostrata, 90 g rehmannia rhizoma, 30 g spatholobus suberectus, 12 g dodder seed, 6 g psoralea corylifolia, 30 g prepared Gold Theragran, 9 g ass-hide gelatin, 9 g fructus lycii, 24 g Salvia miltiorrhiza, 30 g astragalus, 6 g angelica, and so on), one dose daily, decocted twice, taken in two portions. The treatment lasted to the recovery stage. The medication was gradually reduced to the follow-ups of drug discontinuance. Results After 6 -57 months of treatment, 12 patients (accounting for 19.4%) were basically cured, 14 (22.6%) relieved, 8 (12. 9%) markedly improved, 28 (45.2%) ineffectively, with the total effective rate of 54. 8%. Totally 23 patients had the body temperature ranging 37.6-38.5 degrees C at the first visit to our hospital. They took 2 h- 6 days to have pyretolysis ( <37.5 degrees C) after treatment. Twenty patients with body temperature higher than 38.5 degrees C took 4 h - 5 days to have pyretolysis after treatment. Totally 26 patients suffering from IST induced abnormalities of liver and renal functions (ALT, AST, BUN, and Cr) at the first visit were treated by IM for 2 months. They were restored to the normal levels in 25 cases. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of SAA failing in IST had its specificity. The staging targeted treatment is in line with its pathophysiology. The key points for its treatment might be lie in the improvement and protection of hematopoietic microenvironment of bone marrows. The antisepsis and anti-inflammation of Chinese herbs hindered its aggravating tendency.
