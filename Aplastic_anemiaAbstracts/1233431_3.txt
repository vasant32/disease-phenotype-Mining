Two children are presented with similar appearing small urographic defects in the ureter and renal pelvis similar to pyeloureteritis cystica. In one patient with aplastic anemia who died the abnormalities represented areas of subepithelial hemorrhage. Another child had clinically diagnosed Henoch-Schonlein purpura and the defects were probably due to subepithelial hemorrhage.
