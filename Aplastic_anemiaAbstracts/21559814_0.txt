Epstein-Barr virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (EBV-PTLD) is a life-threatening complication following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Monitoring of EBV DNA in high-risk patients with subsequent pre-emptive rituximab treatment is highly effective, and can prevent EBV-associated disease following HSCT. Here, we report a 10-year-old girl with aplastic anemia who developed CD20 negative EBV-PTLD after unrelated bone marrow transplantation that was refractory to rituximab treatment. Similar to other types of lymphoma, the absence of CD20 antigen is likely to be characteristic of rituximab-refractory EBV-PTLD.
