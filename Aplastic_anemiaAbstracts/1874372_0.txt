Basing on the results of the investigation of patients with hypoplastic anemia attended by rheological and immunological disorders who received antilymphocytic globulin, the authors have recommended that the combined therapy of these patients should include lymphocytoplasmapheresis promoting removal of antibodies damaging lymphocytes, their decomposition products, circulating immune complexes, as well as heparin and antiaggregants that allow one to escape the side effects of antilymphocytic globulin.
