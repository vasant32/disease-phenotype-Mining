OBJECTIVE: To explore the expression of c-kit receptor(CD117) on the hemopoietic stem/precursor cells of aplastic anemia patients and its role in the genesis of aplastic hematopoiesis failure. METHODS: c-kit expression on the bone marrow mononuclear cells(MNC) and CD34 positive cells from 11 chronic aplastic anemia (CAA), 9 severe aplastic anemia(SAA), 10 non-aplastic anemia(NAA) patients (5 iron deficiency anemia and 5 autoimmune hemolytic anemia) and 5 healthy controls was measured with flow cytometric immunofluorescence assay and anti-CD117 monoclonal antibody. RESULTS: The CD117 positive rates of MNC in CAA, SAA, NAA and control groups were (2.08 +/- 1.96)%, (0.89 +/- 0.32)%, (0.67 +/- 0.39)% and (0.45 +/- 0.16)%, respectively, and the rates were significantly higher in CAA and SAA groups than in NAA and control groups(P < 0.05). The CD117 and CD34 double positive cells of MNC in CAA, SAA, NAA and control groups were (0.87 +/- 0.57)%, (0.65 +/- 0.41)%, (0.46 +/- 0.26)% and (0.41 +/- 0.15)%, respectively, and were significantly higher in CAA and SAA groups than in NAA and control groups (P < 0.05). The CD117 positive cells of CD34 positive cells were also higher in CAA[(71.6 +/- 12.4)%] and SAA[(88.9 +/- 23.5)%] groups than in NAA[(41.8 +/- 10.3)%] and control [(46.3 +/- 9.7)%] groups (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Hemopoietic stem/precursor cells of aplastic anemia patients expressed more c-kit receptors than those of NAA patients and healthy controls. The hematopoiesis failure occurred in aplastic anemia is not attributed to low expression of c-kit receptor on the hemopoietic stem/precursor cells.
