Severe aplastic anemia (SAA) in children has been previously treated with high dose methyl prednisolone (HDMP) with favorable results. We reviewed our experience with intravenous HDMP. Seven children with a diagnosis of SAA confirmed on bone marrow biopsy were treated with 300 mg/kg total dose of intravenous HDMP over a 4 week period. Patients were closely monitored for response and side effects. HDMP was well tolerated except for hyperglycemia in one case. Six of the seven patients showed no response to HDMP. This observation is in stark contrast with previous trials on use of HDMP in SAA. It is concluded that HDMP should be reserved only for patients with milder bone marrow hypoplasia.
