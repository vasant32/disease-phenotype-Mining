Aplastic anemia is occasionally caused by viral hepatitis, hepatitis C virus being the most important factor. Pathogenetically, decreased bone marrow function, abnormalities of the bone marrow microenvironment, and immune-mediated suppression of hematopoiesis are important. Hepatitis C virus infection is associated with a variety of extrahepatic manifestations including autoimmune features like cryoglobulinemia, Sj√∂gren's syndrome, and autoimmune hepatitis. Here we report the case of a 42-year-old man with aplastic anemia due to posttransfusional hepatitis C virus infection associated with cryoglobulinemia and LKM-1 autoantibodies. Following a triple immunosuppressive therapy, there was a complete reconstitution of the bone marrow. Serum HCV-RNA as well as plus- and minus-stranded HCV-RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were detected before immunosuppressive therapy. After therapy, serum HCV-RNA persisted. Furthermore, PBMC now were positive for plus-stranded RNA only. However, in bone marrow-derived precursor cells we failed to demonstrate HCV molecules after therapy. This would argue for reconstituted PBMC from newly generated uninfected precursor cells. It remains unclear as to whether the autoimmune character of the disease or the hepatitis C virus infection itself have contributed to the pathogenesis of the aplastic anemia.
