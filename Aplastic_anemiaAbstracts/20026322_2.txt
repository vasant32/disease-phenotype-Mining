We report results of a hospital-based case control study of 137 consecutive patients diagnosed with aplastic anemia (AA) in participating hospitals over a 4-year period. Diagnoses were made by a single laboratory, subjects were age- and gender-matched to two controls and interviewed concerning previous disease, work histories and exposures to potential etiologic agents. Analysis was conducted on two distinct subgroups: severe aplastic anemia (SAA) and moderate aplastic anemia (MAA). In univariate regression models, the strongest associations were observed for exposure to benzene and SAA (OR=3.12, 95% CI=1.12-8.65) and life on a farm and MAA (OR=3.08, 95% CI=1.44-6.56). Benzene exposure did not show a strong dose-response relationship with either subtype. When accounting for all of the potential confounders we considered in conditional regression models, the previous relationships persisted. Other explanatory variables included hair-dye use for MAA and farm exposures, such as livestock for SAA, although most of these additional variables fell just short of statistical significance. Adjusted R-squared values were only 10% for each subtype, leaving 90% of AA occurrence unexplained. Our results suggest that: (a) benzene exposure is more strongly related to SAA than MAA, (b) farm and livestock exposures are related to both forms of AA, confirming some previous results, and (c) a large percentage of AA remains unexplained, which may indicate that individual susceptibility has a major influence on AA occurrence.
