Determination of AK types in 372 patients of Hematologic Clinic, revealed in many cases changes in electrophoretic pattern of AK1 type namely the occurrence of an additional protein band. These changes were observed mostly in the acute granulocytic leukemia, lymphoblastic leukemia, and aplastic anemia. In the chronic granulocytic leukemia they were present as a rule, during the blastic crisis. Phenotypic changes were transient and the repeated examinations showed disappearance of an additional band in some patients. Etiology of the changes observed is still unclear.
