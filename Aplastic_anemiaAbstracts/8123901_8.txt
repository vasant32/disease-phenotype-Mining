Some pesticides are hematotoxic and cause aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and thrombopenia. In order to evaluate hematopoietic progenitor cultures in the exploration of pesticide hematotoxicity, human and rat colony-forming unit-granulocyte and macrophage (CFU-GM) were cultured in the presence of different concentrations of pesticides, known to be either hematotoxic or innocuous for blood cells. The results were compared to the control culture of the same sample. Four insecticides (lindane, azinphos, mevinphos, parathion methyl), three herbicides, (2,4,5, T, bromacil, MCPA), and two fungicides (fosethyl-aluminum, DNOC) were tested and exhibited the following data: 1) Pesticides, known to be hematotoxic, inhibited the development of progenitors. Different phenomena were observed and suggested different mechanisms: cell destruction, block in mitosis, decrease or delay in mitosis. 2) Difference in sensitivity to molecules between human and rat progenitors was observed. Human progenitors were more sensitive to pesticides, except for 2,4,5 T.
