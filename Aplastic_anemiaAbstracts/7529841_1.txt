To evaluate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous administration of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) in aplastic anemia (AA), 21 patients were given a daily subcutaneous dose of 200 micrograms/m2 of KRN8601 for 4 weeks. When the blood neutrophil count did not reach 2,000/microliters within 2 weeks, the dose was increased to 400 micrograms/m2. A marked neutrophilic response was obtained in all 9 patients with non-severe AA and in 9 out of the 12 patients with severe AA, yielding a response rate of 85.7%. Adverse effects included lumbago in one patient and elevation of serum enzyme levels in 6 patients, but did not prohibit further treatment. These results suggest that subcutaneous administration of KRN8601 is safe and useful in improving neutropenia in AA.
