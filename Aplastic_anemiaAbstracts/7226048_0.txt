Clinical effectiveness of granulocyte transfusions collected by filtration or by intermittent flow centrifugation was compared in this study. In 251 patients receiving at least four daily transfusions of these products, there was no difference in response rate (67% in each group) as determined by defervescence. The most important factor in the recovery of patients appeared to be the underlying disease causing the agranulocytosis. Patients whose marrows were temporarily suppressed by chemotherapy showed the highest recovery rates (82% lymphoma and carcinoma), whereas those with intrinsic disease in the marrow showed the lowest recovery rates (47% aplastic anemia, 63% acute leukemia).
