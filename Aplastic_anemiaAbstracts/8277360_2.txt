Using a fully automated reticulocyte counter, the roles of the reticulocyte count with maturation in pancytopenia were evaluated. Different groups of pancytopenia including aplastic anemia, infiltrative marrow disorder, hypersplenism, and megaloblastic anemia were recruited. All patients had bone marrow examinations for morphological diagnosis and reticulocyte evaluation using an automated counter. The roles of these parameters were then analyzed statistically in the differential evaluation among these conditions. The following subjects were studied: 292 normal subjects, 67 cases of aplastic anemia, 69 cases of marrow infiltration by different malignancies, 35 cases of hypersplenism, and 13 cases of megaloblastic anemia. The results showed that the absolute reticulocyte counts were lowest in the groups of aplastic anemia and megaloblastic anemia and highest in hypersplenism. Both showed significant differences from the infiltrative groups. The maturation fractions were most immature in the group of marrow infiltration and are significantly different from the other groups. It was concluded that the highest absolute reticulocyte count (> 0.09 10(12)/L) obtained in pancytopenic patients suggests it to be a case of hypersplenism. The lowest counts (< 0.03 10(12)/L) with lowest immature fractions (< 10%) suggest the groups of aplastic or megaloblastic anemias. The highest immature fractions (> 30%) with a nearly normal reticulocyte count favor the group of marrow infiltration.
