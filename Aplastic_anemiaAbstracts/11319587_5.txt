Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired clonal disease of hematopoiesis due to a mutation in the PIG-A gene. Affected patients may demonstrate hemolysis or venous thrombosis, and may develop MDS or aplastic anemia. Successful results may be obtained after conditioning and transplantation from syngeneic or genotypically matched sibling donors. Experience with transplantation from matched unrelated donors (MUD) is limited to eight patients, with only one survivor. We report three patients who underwent successful MUD BMT for PNH. All three patients had severe aplastic anemia (SAA) and PNH at the time of BMT. Unrelated donors were six-antigen HLA-matched (n = 2) or HLA-A mismatched (n = 1). Conditioning consisted of cytarabine, cyclophosphamide, TBI, and ATG. Grafts were T cell-depleted by anti-CD6/CD8 antibodies + complement. Further GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine. Patients received 0.7-1.1 x 10(8) nucleated cells/kg and 1.1-2.1 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg. Neutrophil engraftment occurred at 16-21 days. One patient developed grade 1 acute GVHD. Although all three patients experienced significant transplant-related complications, they ultimately resolved and all patients are alive and well 30-62 months after BMT. T cell-depleted MUD BMT is an effective treatment option for PNH-related MDS and SAA.
