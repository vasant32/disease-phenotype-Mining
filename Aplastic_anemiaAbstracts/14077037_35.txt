A survey of 425 death certificates of radiologists dying between the ages of 35 and 74 during the years 1948 to 1961 reveals a statistically highly significant excess of deaths from leukemia, multiple myeloma, and aplastic anemia. That this excess is due to radiation exposure (or to some factor acting in a similar manner), rather than to an artifact of diagnosis is suggested by the absence of deaths ascribed to chronic lymphatic leukemia.
