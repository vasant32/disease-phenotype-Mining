Apheresis was applied in 17 patients with hypoplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic renal failure and other diseases sensitized to HLA. Apheresis was done for removal of anti-HLA antibodies and prevention of nonhemolytic transfusion reactions. Multiple massive apheresis led to a marked decrease in the antibody level. After the first or second apheresis with removal of 700.0-2000.0 ml of plasma weekly half of the patients showed increasing titres of lymphocytotoxic antibodies.
