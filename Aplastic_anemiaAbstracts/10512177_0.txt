Late clonal complications of aplastic anemia (AA) such as acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes or paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria have been recognized for a long time. To our knowledge, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) as a late complication of severe aplastic anemia has as yet not been reported. We report here a case of AA treated successfully with antilymphocytic globulin and cyclosporin in whom Ph1 negative, BCR/ABL negative CML developed 8 years after diagnosis of AA. This case of atypical, secondary CML was refractory to treatment with interferon alpha and hydroxyurea.
