Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is a rare acquired autoimmune disease, and is frequently associated with venous thrombosis. A patient who developed thrombotic occlusion of the inferior vena cava is described. Treatment with heparin and urokinase, followed by oral anticoagulant, was effective in resolving abdominal symptoms. The venous thrombosis resolved completely, but the patient died during treatment of aplastic anemia.
