Cell cycle phases of bone marrow cells from 8 patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA), 8 aplastic anemia (AA), 30 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 41 acute leukemia (AL) before treatment, 8 acute leukemia in relapse, 17 acute leukemia in complete remission (CR), 12 chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and 4 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were analysed with flow cytometry. The proportions of phases of S. G2 M in patients with IDA, refractory anemia, and refractory anemia with ring sideroblast were similar to these in normal controls (P > 0.05). However, they were significantly lower in patients with AA, refractory anemia with excess of blast (RAEB) and transformed RAEB than those in normal controls (P < 0.01, respectively), and CML patients than in normal controls (P < 0.05). The S G2M% was apparently higher in patients with CML than that in CLL (P < 0.01). But, there was no difference between in ALL and ANLL (P > 0.05). It was higher in patients with AL in CR and in relapse than AL before treatment (both P < 0.01). It was still lower in the former than that in normal controls. (P < 0.05). The clinical significance of cell cycle status was also discussed in this paper.
