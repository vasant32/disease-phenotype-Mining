Aplastic anemia is a very unusual feature of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A 32-year-old lady presented with generalized purpuric lesions and was diagnosed as having immune thrombocytopenic purpura. Fourteen months later, she developed progressive pancytopenia, arthritis of small joints, and oral ulcers. Investigations confirmed SLE with aplastic anemia. High-dose methylprednisolone therapy had been unsuccessful in controlling the pancytopenia. She had a progressive course and died due to septicemia. Even though pancytopenia is common in SLE, a bone marrow examination should be done in all cases of persistent pancytopenia to exclude bone marrow aplasia. This will help in tailoring the treatment with more aggressive immunosuppressants.
