OBJECTIVE: To explore the therapeutic effectiveness of combination of cyclosporin A (CsA) and androgen in the treatment of chronic aplastic anemia (CAA). METHOD: Androgen alone or combined with CsA for the treatment of CAA was compared by a randomized controlled clinical trial. RESULT: The efficacy of androgen combined with CsA (87.9%) was higher than that of androgen alone (57.1%). Therapeutic effectiveness of the combination treatment between the patients with positive and negative peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) inhibiting normal colony formation unit-granulocyte and macrophage (CFU-GM) test showed a significant difference (P < 0.005). CONCLUSION: Androgen combined with CsA had a much better efficacy than that of androgen alone in the treatment of CAA. The patients' PBMNCs inhibiting normal CFU-GM growth test can be used as an index of the treatment outcome. The side effects of the combination therapy are low and tolerable.
