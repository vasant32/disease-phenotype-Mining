Autoradiographic investigations were carried out on bone marrow cells with thymidine H3 in patients with hypoplastic anemia and acute leukosis in hypoplastic phase. In all patients with hypoplastic anemia a considerable decrease of the labelled cells per cent was observed and in four of the patients in a period of exacerbation, two--in remission--no labelled cells were found. In patients with hypoplastic phase of acute leukosis the proliferative activity was absent. The injury of the bone marrow in case of hypoplastic anemia is supposed to occur at the different stages of hemopoesis.
