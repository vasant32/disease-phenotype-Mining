We have prospectively studied the occurrence of monoclonal serum immunoglobulins in 38 recipients of BMT. Patients were young children with primary immunodeficiencies (n = 31), other inherited diseases (n = 4), leukemia (n = 2), or aplastic anemia (n = 1). Twenty-nine received an HLA-nonidentical marrow and nine an HLA-identical marrow. Serum monoclonal immunoglobulins were detected by the immunofixation method. Monoclonal immunoglobulins were found in 26 patients. Monoclonal components were more frequently detected in patients with primary severe T cell deficiencies (21/25) rather than in the other patients (6/13). In 7 of 29 recipients of HLA-nonidentical transplants, versus 0 out of 9 recipients of HLA-identical transplants, serum monoclonal immunoglobulins were found associated with a B lymphocyte proliferation syndrome due to an Epstein-Barr virus infection. In this group, monoclonal immunoglobulins were detected early, prior to the onset of the clinical syndrome. The simultaneous occurrence of several monoclonal immunoglobulins was more frequent in these patients, while monoclonal immunoglobulin concentrations increased faster, especially those of IgM isotype. These characteristics may allow in patients at risk (recipients with primary T cell immunodeficiencies and receiving HLA-nonidentical transplantation) an earlier diagnosis of B lymphocyte proliferative syndrome that may eventually lead to early and more efficient therapy.
