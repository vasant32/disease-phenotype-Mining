AIM: To examine frequency and characteristic features of complications arising in administration of domestic antilymphocytic globulin (ALG) in patients with aplastic anemia (AA). MATERIAL AND METHODS: From 1980 to 2000 125 patients with AA were treated with ALG made in Russia. Two and three courses of ALG were performed in 25 and 8 patients, respectively. RESULTS: The treatment was complicated most often with allergic reactions (AR) observed in 42.4% patients, hemorrhagic syndrome (HS) and infectious complications (IC). Goat ALG was more allergic than rabbit ALG (46.2 vs 34.6%, respectively). If the second course was made with ALG of the same kind, AR occurred in 37.5% patients while ALG of the different kind produced complications only in 11.8% patients. HS was recorded in 37.3% patients, its frequency was unrelated to ALG kind and was not severe (71.2%). IC occurred in 16.5% patients, their occurrence was also unrelated to the ALG kind and were of the first degree in 63.6%. CONCLUSION: Domestic ALG often results in AR. To reduce frequency and severity of complications in ALG treatment, it is recommended to use long intravenous infusions (12-18 h) and change ALG kind in subsequent ALG courses.
