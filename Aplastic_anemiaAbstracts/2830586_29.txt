The records of 96 pediatric patients with aplastic anemia or a malignancy who underwent bone marrow transplantation between 1979 and 1986 at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia were reviewed for laboratory evidence of viral infections. The most common viral diseases identified were herpes simplex virus (HSV), cytomegalovirus and adenoviruses, which were found in 19 (20%), 17 (18) and 17 (18) patients, respectively. HSV was more common in patients with than without graft vs. host disease (GVHD) (9 of 30; 30% vs. 10 of 66; 15%), but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Late or prolonged isolation of HSV occurred in patients with chronic GVHD. Cytomegalovirus was significantly more common in patients with than without GVHD (10 of 30; 33% vs. 7 of 66; 11%). The presence of pretransplant antibody to cytomegalovirus or HSV was a good predictor of subsequent infection. Adenoviruses were isolated from all 3 patients with Burkitt's lymphoma. Adenovirus type 12, a serotype uncommon in man and known to be highly tumorigenic in young hamsters, was recovered from 4 patients. Adenoviruses were not notably more common in patients with GVHD (6 of 30; 20% vs. 11 of 66; 17%). Other viral infections demonstrated included 5 parainfluenza, 4 enteroviruses, 3 human immunodeficiency virus, 1 respiratory syncytial virus, 1 influenza B and 1 rhinovirus.
