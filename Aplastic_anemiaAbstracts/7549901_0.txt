We developed a sensitive method of measurement of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, which we applied in the plasma of the bone marrow aspirate in 70 patients with various hematological disorders. The lowest limit of detection by this method is 2 pg/ml. G-CSF was detected in all but two of the patients. Compared to the G-CSF level in normal healthy controls, those in non-Hodgkin's malignant lymphoma, aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis and multiple myeloma were significantly higher, while the level in refractory anemia was not different. The G-CSF level in acute myelogenous leukemia patients was either elevated or decreased regardless of the French-American-British subgroup. The level in acute lymphoblastic leukemia was not different from the normal value, as was that in refractory anemia with an excess of blasts, and that in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia showed initial elevation of G-CSF with normalization after entering complete remission. The G-CSF level in chronic myelogenous leukemia was significantly decreased, although one patient in hematological remission who was under alpha-interferon therapy showed normal levels. The level in polycythemia vera was not significantly different from the normal value. The G-CSF level for the entire group showed an inverse, although not statistically significant, correlation with the percentages of myeloid cells of the bone marrow (r = -0.174, p = 0.1703, n = 80). These results are thought to reflect the regulatory mechanism of granulopoiesis in the bone marrow in various hematological disorders, and it is concluded that this method may be of clinical use in the treatment of patients with these disorders and in the selection of candidates likely to benefit from G-CSF administration.
