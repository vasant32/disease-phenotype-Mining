A 43-year-old woman with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) received anti-thymocyte globulin and cyclosporin A (CyA) and achieved hematological remission. Although she had maintained hematological remission, the disease relapsed 10 months after arbitrary discontinuance of maintenance therapy with CyA. Resumption of CyA therapy was not effective, and her condition became complicated with progressive sinusitis with bone destruction, which was refractory to antibiotics, antifungal agents, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and surgical drainage. Because of the necessity for early neutrophil recovery (to resolve the infection), we proceeded with a combination therapy using allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) promptly followed by granulocyte transfusion (GTX) from the same human leukocyte antigen-identical donor rather than carrying out a second immunosuppressive therapy. The patient showed temporal resolution of infection on the second day after a single GTX. Although the patient had pneumonia on day 11, it was resolved promptly after engraftment on day 16. This report suggests the clinical utility of a salvage therapy with allogeneic PBSCT followed by GTX in a particular case of recurrent SAA with refractory infections.
