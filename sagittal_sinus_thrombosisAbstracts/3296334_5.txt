An adolescent female with sickle cell trait presented with acute neurologic deterioration during treatment for pseudotumor cerebri. Cranial computed tomography, initially normal, subsequently revealed multiple hemorrhagic infarctions. Suspected superior sagittal sinus thrombosis was confirmed by cerebral angiography. Superior sagittal sinus thrombosis associated with sickle cell trait is exceedingly rare, and the accompanying increased intracranial pressure may require aggressive management.
