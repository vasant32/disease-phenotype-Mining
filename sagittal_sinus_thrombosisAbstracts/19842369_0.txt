Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis has been reported to be associated with various systemic illnesses and infections, including severe malaria. We report here a 43 year-old Thai male presenting with fever and seizures. He was diagnosed as and treated for severe falciparum malaria. After gaining consciousness he developed focal neurological signs and evidence of increased intracranial pressure. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) of the brain revealed a mid-superior sagittal sinus thrombosis with venous infarction. Investigations for other infections and thrombophilia were negative. The patient denied anticoagulant treatment. The clinical status and radiologic findings improved gradually. Physicians who care for malaria patients need to be aware of this rare complication when a malaria patient presents with focal neurological signs.
