Sagittal sinus thrombosis (SSST) is a rare disease with high mortality. Definitive therapy is not known, but anticoagulation or addressing the underlying etiology have been the most often utilized approaches. We here report the second case of postpartum sagittal sinus thrombosis successfully treated with urokinase. Though there are no studies to support this therapy it may be safe and efficacious in refractory cases.
