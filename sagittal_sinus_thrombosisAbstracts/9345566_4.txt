BACKGROUND: Nephrotic syndrome is known to be associated with thrombosis but rarely of cerebral vessels. CASE REPORT: A 3-year old child with steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome was hospitalized for drowziness followed by a left hemiparesis. The CTscan showed a superior sagittal sinus thrombosis. The child completely recovered after treatment by low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). CONCLUSION: LMWH could be used for preventing and/or treating thrombosis associated with nephrotic syndrome. Nevertheless, controlled studies are necessary for assessing its efficacy and absence of risk in children.
