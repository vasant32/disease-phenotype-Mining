A case of superior sagittal sinus thrombosis followed by a subdrual hematoma is reported. A 33-year-old woman, who presented with serious neurological deficits, made a remarkable recovery with mild residual. She had a thin subdural fluid collection, which eventually developed into a subdural hematoma. After evacuation of the hematoma, she had no neurological deficits. Treatment of cerebral venous and dural sinus thrombosis is discussed.
