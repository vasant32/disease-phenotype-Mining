Two patients with superior sagittal sinus thrombosis are reported. Papilloedema was an important diagnostic sign in both cases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provided the diagnosis in each case and proved to be the investigation of choice. Superior sagittal sinus thrombosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of papilloedema as it is both potentially fatal and probably underdiagnosed.
