A newborn boy presented within the first day of life with moaning, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The clinical syndrome resulted from thrombosis of the posterior part of the superior sagittal sinus due to impression at birth of the tip of the occipital squama. Both computed tomography and ultrasound scans were valuable noninvasive tools for documentation of the thrombus itself and the cerebral sequelae. Color Doppler ultrasound scan confirmed the absence and reappearance of flow in the superior sagittal sinus.
