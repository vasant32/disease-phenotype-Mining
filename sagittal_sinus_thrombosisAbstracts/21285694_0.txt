We report a case of a 60-year-old woman, diagnosed as a case of non Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL), referred for F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) following 6 cycles of chemotherapy to evaluate response to therapy. The scan revealed a curvilinear pattern of FDG accumulation in the midline extending anteroposteriorly, just adjacent to the inner table of the skull on the fused PET/CT images with no corresponding abnormality on the low-dose CT. Because this site anatomically corresponded to that of the sagittal sinus, an MRI and magnetic resonance venography was advised which confirmed the presence of sagittal sinus tumor deposits. This case highlights the pattern of sagittal sinus tumor thrombosis on FDG PET/CT and the possibility of its occurrence in NHL.
