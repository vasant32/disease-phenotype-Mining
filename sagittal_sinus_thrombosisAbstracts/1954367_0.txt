MR angiography with selective pre-saturation was applied in 5 normal volunteers, 22 patients with cerebrovascular disease, 3 patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVM) and one patient with thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus. The results were compared with Doppler ultrasound and conventional angiography. MR angiography reliably demonstrated the direction of blood flow and the presence or absence of collateral flow in the circle of Willis. Collateral flow via leptomeningeal vessels and the ophthalmic artery could not be demonstrated. In the patient with superior sagittal sinus thrombosis, the absence of flow was well seen. MR angiography was able to demonstrate the major supplying arteries in the patients with AVMs. MR angiography is a valid noninvasive means to demonstrate direction of flow and blood supply of the major intracranial arteries.
