A 45-year-old male patient presented with gradual onset of headache, vomiting and blurring of vision of 28 days duration. Ophthalmological examination revealed normal anterior segment and pupillary reflex. No abnormality was detected in the vitreous. Optic disc showed features of advanced papilledema with normal macula and retinal periphery in both eyes. Visual acuity was 20/200 in the right eye and counting fingers close range in the left eye. Non-contrast computed tomography of brain was normal and magnetic resonance imaging showed sagittal sinus thrombosis without any evidence of venous infarction or intracranial mass. Routine hematological investigations revealed increased hemoglobin level, packed cell volume and leucocytosis. Further investigation revealed increased Vitamin B12 and decreased serum erythropoietin. A diagnosis of polycythemia vera was made from the above findings. This case is being presented for the rarity of association of polycythemia vera with bilateral advanced papilledema due to sagittal sinus thrombosis.
