Seven cases of superior sagittal sinus thrombosis seen at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital over the 10 year period 1979 to 1989 have been reviewed. Diagnosis was confirmed by angiography, CT scan or autopsy. The average age was 33 years (16 to 47 years). Five of the patients were female and 2 male. On CT scan the 'empty delta' sign, present in 4 cases, was the most specific diagnostic feature. The underlying causes included primary thrombocythaemia, homocystinuria, post-angiographic investigation of an arteriovenous malformation, and oral contraceptives. In 2 cases no cause was found. Headache was the commonest and earliest symptom, being followed in frequency by convulsions and hemiparesis. Hemiparesis was the commonest sign observed, followed by papilloedema, cranial nerve palsies and impaired level of consciousness. Five of the patients developed signs and symptoms of raised intracranial pressure prior to the appearance of focal neurological deficits, mostly likely due to propagation of the thrombosis to cortical veins. There have been no controlled trials of therapy; however it is important to treat raised intracranial pressure rapidly and effectively, and although the role of anticoagulants remains controversial, their early use may be indicated when there is no radiological evidence of haemorrhage.
