An inborn error of metabolism, homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency, results in markedly elevated levels of circulating homocysteine. Premature vascular events are the main life-threatening complication. Half of all untreated patients have a vascular event by 30 years of age. We performed a multicenter observational study to assess the effectiveness of long-term homocysteine-lowering treatment in reducing vascular risk in 158 patients. Vascular outcomes were analyzed and effectiveness of treatment in reducing vascular risk was evaluated by comparison of actual to predicted number of vascular events, with the use of historical controls from a landmark study of 629 untreated patients with cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency. The 158 patients had a mean (range) age of 29.4 (4.5 to 70) years; 57 (36%) were more than 30 years old, and 10 (6%) were older than 50 years. There were 2822 patient-years of treatment, with an average of 17.9 years per patient. Plasma homocysteine levels were markedly reduced from pretreatment levels but usually remained moderately elevated. There were 17 vascular events in 12 patients at a mean (range) age of 42.5 (18 to 67) years: pulmonary embolism (n=3), myocardial infarction (n=2), deep venous thrombosis (n=5), cerebrovascular accident (n=3), transient ischemic attack (n=1), sagittal sinus thrombosis (n=1), and abdominal aortic aneurysm (n=2). Without treatment, 112 vascular events would have been expected, for a relative risk of 0.09 (95% CI 0.036 to 0.228; P<0.0001). Treatment regimens designed to lower plasma homocysteine significantly reduce cardiovascular risk in cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency despite imperfect biochemical control. These findings may be relevant to the significance of mild hyperhomocysteinemia that is commonly found in patients with vascular disease.
