Cerebral vein thrombosis is a known complication of active ulcerative colitis. It is generally believed that panproctocolectomy ameliorates the thromboembolic and other systemic complications of ulcerative colitis. We report an unusual patient, 10 years post-panproctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis, who developed a cerebral sinus thrombosis. Physicians should be aware of the possibility of thromboembolic complications of ulcerative colitis long after definitive surgery has been performed.
