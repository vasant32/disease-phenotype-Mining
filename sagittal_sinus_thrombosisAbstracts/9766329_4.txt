OBJECTIVE: To explore the controversial issue of anticoagulant therapy and indications for surgery in association with severe sinus thrombosis. METHODS: During the last 4 years, we have treated three patients with severe sinus thrombosis of the dural sinuses. All three patients received systemic anticoagulant therapy and, after experiencing neurological deterioration, underwent open thrombectomy and local thrombolysis. After the operation, aggressive intensive care was given and included cerebral perfusion monitoring, barbiturate administration, hyperventilation, and osmotherapy. The treatment was guided by repeated neuroradiological investigations. RESULTS: All three patients returned to their normal lives. CONCLUSION: Intracranial sinus thrombosis, even in the worst neurological state, should be treated aggressively. A cornerstone in treatment is systemic anticoagulant therapy and repeated neuroradiological studies. When, despite adequate anticoagulant therapy and intensive care, neurological deterioration occurs, a combination of open thrombectomy and local thrombolytic therapy should be considered.
