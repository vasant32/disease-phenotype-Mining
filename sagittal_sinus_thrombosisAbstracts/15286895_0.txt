Superior sagittal sinus thrombosis (SSST) is a rare entity, most often arising from infections, dehydration, and hematologic disorders. Development of this condition secondary to trauma is extremely rare. In this report, a 13-year-old boy who developed SSST following a closed head injury is presented. Imaging studies showed SSST caused by a depressed skull fracture. Neurologic examination of the patient was normal other than bilateral papillary stasis. He was treated with antiedematous and anticonvulsant drugs. Magnetic resonance venography obtained eight months after the diagnosis showed unoccluded superior sagittal sinus, neurologic examination findings were normal, as well.
