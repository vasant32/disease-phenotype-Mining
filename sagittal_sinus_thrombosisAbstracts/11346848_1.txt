Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a disease with multiple known etiologies that present with a remarkably wide spectrum of clinical signs and symptoms. We present a case of a 34-year-old man with a history of meningeal symptoms for 1 week after receiving a lumbar injection for lower back pain. He subsequently developed dense right hemiplegia and global aphasia. Head magnetic resonance imaging revealed superior sagittal sinus thrombosis. The patient was started on intravenous heparin but deteriorated neurologically. Urokinase infusion directly into the superior sagittal sinus was performed, with striking functional and neurologic improvement. Lupus anticoagulant was positive. We also present the case of a 24-year-old pregnant woman who developed an acute onset of meningeal symptoms and resultant left hemiparesis. Head magnetic resonance angiography revealed thrombosis of right transverse and sigmoid sinuses. Protein S deficiency was found. She was started on intravenous heparin, then enoxaparin, with improvement in symptoms. These cases demonstrate that CVT can be a cause of stroke in young patients with hypercoagability disorders, and a heightened awareness of CVT will promote optimal medical care and functional outcomes. Excellent functional recovery is likely with early recognition and treatment of the underlying etiology, as well as successful lysis of the clot.
