A 21-year-old woman was admitted with right hemiparesis, bilateral papilledema, negative myoclonus of right upper extremity, and bilateral pyramidal findings. An MRI showed no venous flow in the inferior sagittal sinus. Lipoprotein a (Lp [a]) level was high and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) was found. The coexistence of IDA and Lp (a) in patients with cerebral venous thrombosis is a very rare condition in adult patients. These risk factors should be investigated in patients with cerebral venous thrombosis.
