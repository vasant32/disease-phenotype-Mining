The objective of the investigation was to determine what effect intracranial pathology has on alterations of superior sagittal sinus blood flow, and to determine the role of color flow Doppler imaging of the superior sagittal sinus in the diagnosis of intracranial pathology in the neonate and infant. One hundred examinations were performed prospectively in 96 patients. The velocity was determined with an angle correction at 30-60 degrees and was obtained with and without gentle transducer compression. Superior sagittal sinus thrombosis was identified in two patients by the absence of flow. Multiple t-tests for independent measures showed no clinically significant differences between flow velocities with regard to intracranial hemorrhage, ventriculomegaly, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy or prematurity. The authors conclude that color flow Doppler can accurately diagnose superior sagittal sinus thrombosis and may be used to screen high risk neonates such as those with thrombosis elsewhere or those treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. No clinically significant associations were found between superior sagittal sinus flow velocity and any of the parameters evaluated in this study.
