A 61-year-old woman under treatment with oral medroxyprogesterone acetate following surgery for breast cancer developed diplopia and papilledema due to raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Radiological studies disclosed an empty sella turcica, a dural arteriovenous malformation (AVM), and superior sagittal sinus thrombosis. The sinus thrombosis was considered to have been a side effect of the medroxyprogesterone acetate medication. The association between a primary empty sella and raised ICP is briefly discussed, along with the cause-and-effect relationship between a dural AVM and venous sinus thrombosis.
