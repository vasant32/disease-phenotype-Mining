Seven patients with cancer complicated by nonmetastatic sagittal sinus thrombosis were encountered in a 7-year period. Five had hematologic malignancies and two had solid tumors. There were two different presentations. In the first, neurologic signs and symptoms (e.g., headaches, seizures, hemiparesis, lethargy) occurred suddenly in five patients shortly after initiation of cancer therapy. Four of these five patients recovered with minimal residua; the fifth died as a direct result of the sinus thrombosis. The second presentation occurred in the two patients with terminal cancer who declined gradually without focal signs; both patients died. Only arteriography can reliably establish the diagnosis of sagittal sinus occlusion. In patients with cancer, sagittal sinus occlusion probably results from a "hypercoagulable state" associated with the systemic neoplasm.
