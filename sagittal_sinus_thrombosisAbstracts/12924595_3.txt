A 57-year-old female presented with intracranial hypertension secondary to non-thrombotic superior sagittal sinus occlusion manifesting as acute onset of headache, vomiting, and disorientation. She had a history of intrapelvic malignant lymphoma. Neuroimaging and tumor biopsy revealed that both the superior sagittal sinus and the straight sinus were occluded by metastatic deposits of malignant lymphoma. Her clinical symptoms were remarkably improved by irradiation and chemotherapy, and the affected sinuses were angiographically recanalized.
