 UNLABELLED: ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is a rare condition. The most frequent symptoms and signs are headache, focal seizures with or without secondary generalization, unilateral or bilateral paresis and papilledema. We report a case of transverse sinus and superior sagittal sinus thrombosis that presented with diplopia in a pregnant woman. CASE PRESENTATION: A 34-year-old Malay woman, gravida 3 para 2 at 8 weeks of pregnancy, was admitted for hyperemesis gravidarum, presented with sudden onset of diplopia, blurring of vision and headache. A magnetic resonance scan of her brain showed the presence of cerebral edema with no space occupying lesion, but magnetic resonance venography ultimately revealed right transverse sinus and superior sagittal sinus thrombosis. The patient was treated with anticoagulation for 1 year, after which the patient recovered fully. CONCLUSION: Due to its diverse and varied neurological presentation, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis should be considered in almost any brain syndrome.
