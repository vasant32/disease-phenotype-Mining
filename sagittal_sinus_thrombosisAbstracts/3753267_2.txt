Superior sagittal sinus thrombosis, documented by cerebral angiography, was demonstrated by indium-111 platelet scintigraphy in a 40-year-old man presenting with seizures and intracerebral hematoma. Early scintigraphy demonstrated focal increased indium-111 activity at the two ends of the thrombus, while later scintigraphy showed diffuse increased activity in the area of the sinus. This initial experience suggests that platelet scintigraphy may provide unique information regarding the natural history of intracranial venous thrombosis.
