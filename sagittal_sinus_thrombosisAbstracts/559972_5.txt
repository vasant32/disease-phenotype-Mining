Two cases of superior sagittal sinus thrombosis were diagnosed using a new technique of dynamic radionuclide brain-imaging. With the patient's head in the posterior oblique position, and 80-lens optical camera records the appearance of radionuclides in the superior sagittal sinus. This technique is quick and noninvasive, and serial studies are easily performed. Dural sinus thrombosis is difficult to diagnose on clinical findings alone. Dynamic canning should be used to screen high risk patients, such as those having pseudotumor syndrome or clotting disorders and elderly patients having pulmonary emboli or unexplained deterioration of mental status.
