Three children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia developed sagittal sinus thrombosis. One patient was in peripheral remission. One patient survived. In neither patient who died were the walls of the dural sinuses infiltrated with leukemic cells. Attention is drawn to this potentially treatable cause of central nervous system symptoms in childhood leukemia. Angiography is the diagnostic test of choice and can also demonstrate intracerebral hematoma and subdural hematoma, if present. Sinus thrombosis can occur either during exacerbation or remission of the basic leukemic process. The possibility that chemotherapeutic techniques predispose toward this complication is raised.
