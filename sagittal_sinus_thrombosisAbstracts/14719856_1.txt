We report a case of cerebral sinus thrombosis, which is a rare but serious complication that may develop during high-altitude climbing. A climber who reached the summit of Gasherbrum I (8068 m) suffered from motor weakness and gait disturbance as he descended from the peak. Within a few days, the symptoms progressed until he could not walk. Following a difficult and week-long rescue mission by his colleagues, he was hospitalized and diagnosed with thrombosis at the superior sagittal and right transverse sinuses. Climbers and rescuers should know the risk factors of this complication, such as hemoconcentration, procoagulability, and dehydration.
