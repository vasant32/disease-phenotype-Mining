A young lady who had aplastic anaemia presented for cerebral venous thrombosis after five years of follow up. She was diagnosed to have paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria. She had received immunosuppressive therapy with methylprednisolone, cyclosporine-A, anti-lymphocyte globulin, danazol and pregnenolone. The relation between aplastic anaemia, paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria and cerebral venous thrombosis is discussed. The role of immunosuppressive therapy for aplastic anaemia in causation of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria is reviewed.
