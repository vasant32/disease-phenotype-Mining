Cerebral venous outflow obstruction and anomalies in cerebral venous circulation predispose to dural sinus thrombosis. This case report illustrates the magnetic resonance and angiographic findings in a patient who had superior sagittal sinus thrombosis secondary to idiopathic bilateral internal jugular vein stenosis, a previously unrecognized entity. The findings suggest that bilateral stenosis of the internal jugular veins at their junction with the innominate veins causes obstruction to cerebral venous outflow leading to dural sinus thrombosis.
