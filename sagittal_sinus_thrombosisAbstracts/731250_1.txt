Five female patients, all either on contraceptive medication or in the postpartum period, with angiographically confirmed superior sagittal sinus thrombosis have been scanned. CAT appearances are nonspecific, but when taken in conjuction with the symptoms should suggest the possible diagnosis. The most consistent appearance was of diffuse cerebral swelling with subsequent return to normal. Bilateral low attenuation lesions with haemorrhagic areas were noted in one patient.
