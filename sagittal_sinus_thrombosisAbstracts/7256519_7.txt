Superior sagittal sinus thrombosis is an often unrecognized clinical condition. This is due to its variable clinical presentation and its association with other serious disease states. The following cases demonstrate that, in the infant, thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus can be diagnosed quickly and noninvasively by computed tomography (CT). In those clinical situations in which thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus may occur and neurological changes exist, axial and coronal CT scans may be quite specific in detecting its occurrence.
