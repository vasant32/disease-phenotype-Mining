Forty-seven patients presenting with acute intracerebral haematomas between 1989 and 1992 were retrospectively examined to assess the role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in identifying any underlying lesion. None had any prior known intracerebral pathology. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were done on a 0.5 T unit. Ten patients with an average age of 35 years had angiographically occult vascular malformations (AOVM) found by MRI (one with biopsy confirmation). One of three cases of glioma, three of three cases with secondary tumour, one case of superior sagittal sinus thrombosis with haemorrhagic infarction, one of two cases of venous angioma and one case of arteriovenous malformation were detected by MRI. Progress computed tomography scans discovered two cases of glioma and angiography found a venous angioma and an arterial aneurysm, all undetected by MRI. It is concluded that MRI scanning is helpful in detecting underlying AOVM as a cause of intracerebral haemorrhage but its role in imaging haemorrhagic tumours remains unclear.
