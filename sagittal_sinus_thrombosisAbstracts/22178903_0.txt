 OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to characterize the normal ultrasonographic growth of the fetal superior sinus sagittalis (SSS) throughout gestation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective cross-sectional study, measurements of the fetal sinus sagittalis were obtained in patients undergoing elective fetal anatomical surveys or fetal growth scan at between 16.6 and 34.7 weeks of gestation. Special attention was given to the SSS of the fetal brain. On the coronal plane, the SSS may be easily identified immediately below the frontal bone, and anterior to the fetal head parenchyma. RESULTS: 206 fetuses were scanned. A regression line of the SSS was created throughout gestation and a first-degree correlation was found between gestational age (GA) and the SSS height (r = 0.418; p < 0.0001; SSS = -0.015 + 0.0178 Ã— GA). Normal values were established for different gestational weeks. CONCLUSION: We provide ultrasonographic dimensions of the fetal SSS across pregnancy. This data potentially allows for prenatal diagnosis of abnormal appearance of the SSS.
