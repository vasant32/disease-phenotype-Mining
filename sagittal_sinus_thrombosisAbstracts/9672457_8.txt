Superior sagittal sinus thrombosis (SSST) is an unusual disorder, most often attributed to hematological abnormalities, oral contraceptive use, or association with the puerperium. Although SSST secondary to trauma has been reported, it still remains an extremely rare entity. Antemortem diagnosis of SSST is made by findings on computed tomographic scanning, cerebral angiography, or magnetic resonance imaging. Prognosis is variable and spontaneous resolution has been reported. Successful treatment options of spontaneous cases include systemic anticoagulation and thrombolytic therapy along with supportive measures. There are currently no guidelines for the management of SSST associated with traumatic brain injury. This report describes a case of SSST in a man who sustained a closed head injury.
