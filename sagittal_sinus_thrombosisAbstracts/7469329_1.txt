A case of Staphylococcus aureus osteomyelitis of the skull following scalp reduction and hair plug transplantation is presented. Frontal and biparietal craniectomies were performed, adjacent galea and subcutaneous tissues were excised, and intravenous antibiotics were administered to eradicate the infection and forestall the development of sagittal sinus thrombosis. Persistent drainage of hair plug transplantation sites may suggest underlying osteomyelitis.
