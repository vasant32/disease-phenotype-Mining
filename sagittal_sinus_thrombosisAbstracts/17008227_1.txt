Patients with high fever and multiorgan involvement were investigated for the determination of frequency, clinical course and complications of leptospirosis in Istanbul. Leptospirosis was determined in 22 cases among the 35 hospitalized patients that were pre-diagnosed as leptospirosis according to 'Probable Leptospirosis Diagnosis and Follow-up' form. Among the leptospirosis cases 19 were male and 16 were military staff. Mean age was 35.6 y. Dark field examination (DFE), latex agglutination test (LAG), ELISA IgM, leptospirosis culture (LC) and microscopic agglutination test (MAT) were performed to confirm the diagnoses. The most frequent initial symptoms and findings were fever, fatigue, headache, nausea-vomiting and increased muscle sensitivity. Jaundice was noted only in 2 cases. A 74-y-old female patient died after the recurrence of the disease with severe rhabdomyolysis and pulmonary failure. Sagittal sinus thrombosis, perimyocarditis and chronic renal failure were major complications in another 3 patients. ELISA IgM, LC, DFE, LAG and MAT tests were positive in 68, 72, 82, 100 and 100% of the patients, respectively. As a conclusion, diagnosis of leptospirosis is usually overlooked. Clinical awareness, use of probable leptospirosis diagnosis forms and the application of different laboratory methods in the diagnosis of suspected cases may offer the chance to diagnose the leptospirosis accurately.
