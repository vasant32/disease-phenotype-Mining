BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to assess the usefulness of the Doppler technique in the monitoring of microembolic signals in the main venous outflow pathways in superior sagittal sinus thrombosis. METHODS: Transcranial Doppler ultrasound was performed with a range-gated 2-MHz transducer in 6 patients with superior sagittal sinus thrombosis, in 5 subjects with platelet hyperaggregability, and in 20 healthy volunteers. Emboli monitoring was performed mainly in one distal internal jugular vein for 10 to 15 minutes. RESULTS: Three of the six patients (50%) with superior sagittal sinus thrombosis had microemboli. None of the patients with platelet hyperaggregation or healthy volunteers revealed microemboli. CONCLUSIONS: Microemboli can be found in superior sagittal sinus thrombosis by Doppler ultrasound. Their prognostic significance remains to be determined.
