We report a patient treated for small lymphocytic lymphoma/leukemia with cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis (CVST) after lumbar puncture with intrathecal administration of methotrexate (MTX). He also developed a cerebrospinal fluid flow block. This is the first report of an association between lumbar puncture and intrathecally administered MTX and the development of CVST. Intrathecal treatment in this patient was discontinued and he was successfully treated with high-dose low-molecular-weight heparin subcutaneously.
