There is increasing evidence that local thrombolysis can be used with relative safety and efficacy in adults with superior sagittal sinus thrombosis (SSST). However, little data is available on the use of local thrombolysis in children with SSST. We report three patients who received local thrombolysis for dural sinus thrombosis. Two patients received urokinase and one patient received urokinase followed by local TPA infusion. Recanalization was achieved in two patients.
