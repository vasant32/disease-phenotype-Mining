Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is not a recognized complication of end-stage liver disease. A case of sagittal sinus thrombosis in a 44-year-old male with end-stage hepatic cirrhosis is described. Recurrent seizures were the only manifestation. Work-up revealed severe deficiency of protein C, protein S, and antithrombin III. He was treated with low molecular weight heparin and underwent an orthotopic liver transplant after three months. Follow-up helical CT venogram showed resolution of the sinus thrombosis.
