We report on a patient with nephrotic syndrome who developed superior sagittal sinus thrombosis. He presented with double vision due to bilateral sixth-nerve palsy and papilledema. The thrombosis resolved with intravenous heparin and oral corticosteroids. A month later there were no signs of ocular movement paresis, and both optic nerves were normal.
