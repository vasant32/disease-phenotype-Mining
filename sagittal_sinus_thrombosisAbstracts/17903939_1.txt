We report a 30-year-old man who developed superior sagittal sinus thrombosis during the course of ulcerative colitis. Cerebral venous thrombosis that concurrently develops with ulcerative colitis is extremely rare. Only 31 such patients have been reported. Hematologic examination showed abnormalities in the coagulation system in 47% of these patients. Steroids were administered to 69% of these patients. Outcomes were poor: 50% of these patients had neurologic sequelae or died. The risk of cerebral venous thrombosis should always be considered during the course of ulcerative colitis.
