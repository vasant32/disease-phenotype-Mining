BACKGROUND/AIMS: Evaluation of clinical, demographic and epidemiologic features of ulcerative colitis and therapy response of these patients. METHODOLOGY: Retrospectively, 116 patients (64.7% female) were enrolled in this study. Mean age and mean follow-up period were 36+/-16, 5+/-2 years, respectively. RESULTS: The most common anatomic involvement was pancolitis (60.3%) and the others were as follows: left side 25%, rectum 13.8% and ileum (backwash ileitis) 0.9%. Extraintestinal manifestations were observed in 42.2% of patients (sacroiliitis 12%, primary sclerosing cholangitis 7.6%, pyoderma gangrenosum 2.4%, peripheral arthropathy 1.6%, autoimmune hepatitis 1.6%, steatosis 12.9%, gallstone 0.8%, perianal fistulas 0.8%, sagittal sinus thrombosis 0.8%, psoriasis 0.8%). Multiple extraintestinal manifestations were observed (primary sclerosing cholangitis + pyoderma gangrenosum) in 2 patients. Colonic perforation due to toxic megacolon was observed in only one patient during follow-up period. The mean period for remission was 3.7 months in 72% of patients with pancolitis by the treatment of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) (2-3 gr/day) + methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) +/- (for maintenance of remission) azathioprine (AZT) (1.5-2 mg/kg/day); 3.7 months in 72% of left-sided colitis by 5-ASA +/- corticosteroid enemas +/- methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) +/- (for maintenance of remission) AZT (1.5-2 mg/kg/day) and 3.7 months in 62.5% of patients with distal colitis by 5-ASA (p.o. +/- enema) +/- corticosteroid enemas. Colectomy was performed on 7 patients refractory to these treatments. Six patients (4 of them had pancolitis) were treated with cyclosporine (Cys) (4 mg/kg/day, p.o.). Only one patient, a non-responder to Cys therapy, had colectomy. The mean remission time was 4.7 months in 80.6% of patients with extraintestinal involvement and 3.2 months in 71.2% of patients without extraintestinal involvement (P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Medical therapy was generally enough for the treatment. Cys and/or surgery can be another choice for the patients that do not respond to the medical therapy. Extraintestinal manifestations do not change the remission rate, but prolong the time to catch remission.
