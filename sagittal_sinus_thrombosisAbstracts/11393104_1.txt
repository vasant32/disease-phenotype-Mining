Pneumocephalus secondary to septic superior sagittal sinus thrombosis (SSSST) is extremely rare. We report computed tomography (CT) findings in a 63-year-old man with SSSST caused by the gas-forming organism Klebsiella pneumoniae. The patient presented with fever, chills, general weakness, and spontaneous progressive swelling of the right frontoparietal scalp. CT revealed a gas-containing abscess over the right frontoparietal subgaleal region and in the superior sagittal sinus. Surgical drainage of the subgaleal abscess was performed and blood and pus cultures grew Klebsiella pneumoniae. The patient died of sepsis on the 6th day of hospitalization.
