Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (ILBCL) is a rare subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (as currently recognized by the World Health Organization classification) and is characterized by proliferation of mature B-cells within the lumina of small and medium vessels. We report on a 66-year-old man who presented with a fever of undetermined origin, a splenomegaly, and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level. The diagnosis of ILBCL was established by a bone marrow biopsy that showed CD20+ tumor cells confined within the lumina of sinuses. A karyotypic analysis obtained from the bone marrow aspirate showed a hypotetraploid clone. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed multiple high-signal areas in the periventricular white matter above the tentorium. Focal dural enhancement (pachymeningitis) close to the medium third of the superior sagittal sinus was also observed and was related to a partial superior sagittal sinus thrombosis as confirmed by venous magnetic resonance angiography. After 8 courses of a CHOP (cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisone) plus rituximab regimen, normalization of the superior sagittal sinus and of the bone marrow was obtained. With a follow-up of 15 months, the patient is still considered in complete remission. This observation highlights an unusual vascular aspect of ILBCL and the efficacy of the current standard treatment for this age group (CHOP/rituximab) in this particularly aggressive lymphoma subtype.
