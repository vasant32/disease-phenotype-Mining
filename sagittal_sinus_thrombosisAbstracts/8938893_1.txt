Cerebral venous thrombosis is a life-threatening disorder for which the management has been controversial. A 23-year-old critically-ill man with superior sagittal sinus thrombosis (SSST) and cavernous sinus thrombosis secondary to sinusitis following inhalational drug abuse was managed with full heparinization from the fourth day of presentation. He went on to make a full recovery. The association between this form of drug abuse, sinusitis and SSST is an important one, and warrants antibiotics and early aggressive anticoagulation therapy.
