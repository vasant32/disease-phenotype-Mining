CASE REPORT: We present the case of an 8-month-old infant who was admitted to our Neurosurgery Department with venous infarction related to sagittal sinus thrombosis. The infarction was radiologically detected 5 days after the baby had undergone surgery for acute subdural hematoma due to a closed head injury. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Cerebrovascular venous thrombosis is a rare clinical entity that has multiple causes and variable presenting symptoms. There is no consensus on overall strategy concerning surgical, radiosurgical, or medical therapy (anti-coagulation, thrombolytic, and anti-edema treatment), and exactly how, when, or in which cases these should be applied. The treatment planning should be based on clinical findings, and should be modified according to the clinical course. In this case, the clinical and radiological findings regressed with symptomatic treatment alone.
