The case of a 59-year-old Caucasian man who presented with a 6-week history of intermittent blurring of vision and diplopia is reported. Fundoscopy revealed asymmetrical, bilateral optic disc swelling with peripapillary haemorrhages. An initial CT scan and D-dimer level were reported as normal. A subsequent MRI revealed a recanalising superior sagittal sinus thrombosis. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is a rare and potentially fatal condition. The author suggests that it should be part of the differential diagnosis of bilateral optic disc swelling and that a normal unenhanced CT scan and D-dimer would not rule out this potentially devastating condition.
