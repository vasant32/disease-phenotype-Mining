Ten eclamptic patients complicated by acute cerebrovascular disease were admitted during the past eight years from Feb. 1982 to Feb. 1990. There were six cases of superior sagittal sinus thrombosis, two cases of cerebral hemorrhage, one cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage and the other one of cerebral infarction. Among them, eight patients were cured. Our analysis demonstrates that it is advisable to terminate pregnancy by cesarean section as soon as possible. A comprehensive management proposed by good cooperation between neurologist, neurosurgeon and obstetrician is the key to get a good way to cure these patients.
