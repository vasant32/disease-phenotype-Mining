The case of a newborn with a superior sagittal sinus thrombosis is reported. The clinical symptoms are difficult to differentiate from other cerebral conditions in the neonatal period. Sudden appearance of signs of raised intracranial pressure, however, is characteristic. Main predisposing factors are infection, dehydration and polycythemia. Before computed tomography (CT) became available, the diagnosis could be made only by means of invasive examination techniques. Today CT, in many cases, allows a rapid diagnosis of this condition.
