A 33-year-old female who had been on a steroid treatment for the past 14 years due to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) visited our hospital complaining of mild headache. No neurological deficit and no positive serologic tests for lupus anticoagulants (LAC) and anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) were noted. Only a mild inflammatory change was observed on routine hematological examination. On neuroradiological examination, MRI revealed thickened falx cerebri and tentorium cerebelli, and an empty delta sign. These findings were suggestive of sinus thrombosis of superior sagittal sinus (SSS). Angiograms clearly demonstrated occlusion of the posterior part of superior sagittal sinus and transeverse sinus (TS). Conservative treatment was chosen because of no evidence of intracranial hypertension. There was no deterioration in her general and neurological status during her hospital stay and she was discharged. Longstanding vasculitis and pachymeningitis related to lupus erythematosus might be the probable cause of the sinus thrombosis in this case.
