 PURPOSE: This study was designed to determine whether, among Japanese patients receiving medical treatment for carotid stenosis, symptomatic carotid stenosis was more strongly associated with subsequent neurological events than asymptomatic carotid stenosis. METHODS: We consecutively registered Japanese patients with carotid stenosis of 50% or more as evaluated by digital subtraction angiography who were treated medically. We reviewed medical records regarding previous neurological events as well as other stroke risk factors and underlying diseases at admission. We monitored the occurrence and date of stroke and death after the first evaluation. We also attempted to obtain information from patients or their family members by means of a questionnaire or telephone survey. RESULTS: Among 67 patients with carotid stenosis of 50% or more who were treated medically, follow-up was completed in 62 subjects (56 men, 6 women; median age, 72 years; mean follow-up period, 37.3 months). The number of patients with subsequent stroke with symptomatic carotid stenosis was five, while that with asymptomatic stenosis was four. A significantly higher rate of subsequent stroke was observed in patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis compared with those with asymptomatic stenosis (p=0.012). Cox proportional hazards model indicated that symptomatic carotid stenosis was significantly correlated with future neurologic events (p=0.019). CONCLUSION: In a Japanese population with carotid stenosis treated medically, symptomatic carotid stenosis is associated with future stroke more frequently than asymptomatic carotid stenosis.
