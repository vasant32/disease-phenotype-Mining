The majority of carotid revascularization procedures are done in patients without recent symptoms of cerebral ischemia (asymptomatic carotid stenosis). In previous studies from the past two decades, the stroke risk associated with asymptomatic carotid stenosis has been estimated to be 2-2.5% per year. Given the relatively benign nature of asymptomatic carotid stenosis, it has been proposed that confining revascularization to a limited, higher-risk subgroup is a sensible strategy. Evidence is accumulating that improved medical therapy has led to a lower risk of stroke in medically treated patients and that ultrasound methods can identify higher-risk patients. These developments are highlighted in this article.
