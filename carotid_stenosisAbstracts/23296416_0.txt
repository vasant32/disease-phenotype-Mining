During the last 20 years, asymptomatic patients with high-grade carotid stenosis have been treated with carotid endarterectomy and more recently with carotid artery stenting in order to prevent stroke. New, best medical treatment including statins, beta-blockers, antiplatelet therapies, and better diabetes and blood pressure control might reduce the incidence of stroke in this patient population making invasive treatment unnecessary. However, patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis cannot be considered a homogenous population, and therefore, the therapeutic approach should take into consideration a subgroup of patients with greater risk of cerebrovascular event. Unfortunately, these risk factors are not well categorized thus far, although multiple publications have addressed each one of these factors individually. Recognizing these risk factors is essential for optimizing surveillance and therapeutic approach based on individual risk. The purpose of this article is to review such factors, including patient history, presence of embolic signals on Transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and plaque morphology. These factors should identify high risk asymptomatic individuals who could benefit from carotid stenting or carotid endarterectomy.
