In 2011, five independent, international guideline committees reported their recommendations for the management of symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. These included the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, the Society for Vascular Surgery, the European Society of Cardiology, the Australasian, and the UK National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence. As the recommendations of these five guideline committees were based on the same published literature, it would be expected that they are similar, at least to a large extent. Surprisingly, there were considerable differences between the five guidelines regarding the management of both symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid patients. The differences in the recommendations between the five Guideline Committees are analyzed and discussed.
