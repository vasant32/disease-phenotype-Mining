 BACKGROUND: In this article, we present our experience with such operations performed under local anaesthesia. METHODS: From January 1997 to November 2007, there were 387 patients operated on for asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Patient data were retrospectively evaluated. Thirty-day neurological morbidity and mortality from six different subgroups were analysed and compared. The numbers of perioperative transient ischaemic attacks, as well as surgical and other perioperative complications were also evaluated. RESULTS: Overall morbidity and mortality was 1.8% (seven patients). Stroke was noted in 1.3% (five patients). Transitory ischaemic attacks within the first 30 days were observed in 1.6% (six patients). Only those patients who had intraluminal shunt insertion were found to have significantly higher morbidity and mortality. (p = 0.000018). Myocardial infarction was observed in 0.5% (two patients), one fatal. CONCLUSION: We have achieved acceptable morbidity and mortality rates (1.8%) according to the parameters set by previous studies such as Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study and Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis Trial as well as American Heart Association and European Stroke Organisation guidelines. All surgeries were done under local anaesthesia. Shunts were inserted in 22 cases (5.68%).
