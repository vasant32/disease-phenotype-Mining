Assessment and treatment plan for asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis are based on angiography at the present time. However, angiography or other imaging modalities are limited with their resolution to detect high-risk plaque features. Intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT) recently emerged as a novel imaging modality with a unique resolution to identify vulnerable plaque characteristics. We report use of IVOCT in two separate asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis with two different plaque types.
