A 73-year-old female visited her local doctor after repeatedly experiencing temporary weakness in her left upper and lower extremities. The patient underwent a cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and was diagnosed with right internal carotid artery stenosis. Despite administration of antiplatelet drugs, her symptoms continued, and she was referred to our department for medical treatment. Her medical history revealed hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cholesteatoma. We diagnosed symptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis and performed carotid endarterectomy (CEA). However, tight adhesions between the carotid artery and surrounding tissue made separation difficult, and surgery had to be discontinued. Some of the extracted adherent tissue consisted of hyalinized fibrous tissue that had the appearance of soft tissue which had organized because of inflammation. Although there have been no reports of cholesteatoma directly causing adhesion around the internal carotid artery, it has been reported to have led to abscess formation in the parapharyngeal space adjacent to the carotid space. Because the boundaries of the parapharyngeal space and carotid space are anatomically incomplete, inflammation often affects the area between them. As far as we know, this report, which also includes a discussion of the literature, is the first to indicate that cholesteatoma causes strong adhesions around the carotid artery.
