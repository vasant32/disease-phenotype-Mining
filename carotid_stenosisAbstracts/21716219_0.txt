The study aimed to prove the efficacy of carotid endarterectomy in patients with transient monocular blindness caused by carotid arterial stenosis. 31 patients, aged 45-80 years, were included in the study. All patients were divided in 2 groups: 16 patients from the first group had classic carotid endarterectomy with synthetic patch; 15 patients from the second group were treated conservatively. All operated patients had no stroke or transient ischemic attack and were spared from amaurosis attacks and even showed certain vision sharpness improvement. Whereas the majority of patients from the second group showed the recurrence of the amaurosis fugax attacks after the treatment. Carotid endarterectomy significantly improves the condition of an eye and prevents brain ischemia in patients with transient monocular blindness caused by carotid arterial stenosis.
