The study was aimed at elucidating the relationship between the severity of atherosclerotic lesions in carotid arteries and cardiac pathology in 182 elderly patients subjected to vascular and extravascular surgical treatment. They were divided into 2 groups differing in the degree of atherosclerosis. Group 1 was comprised of 93 patients (mean age 64+/-05 yr) without stenosis of internal carotid artery or with stenosis of less than - 50%, group 2 included 89 patients (mean age 67+/-0.5 yr) with hemodynamically significant stenosis of internal carotid artery. It was shown that carotid stenosis over 50% is frequently associated with the history of myocardial infarction and stable angina of effort. An increase of the degree of stenosis was accompanied by a decrease of stroke and minute volumes.
