 OBJECTIVE: To compare the early complications of carotid stenting (CAS) and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in treatment of carotid artery stenosis. METHODS: Between January 2005 and December 2007, 63 patients with carotid artery stenosis were treated with CEA in 36 cases (CEA group) and with CAS in 27 cases (CAS group). There were 42 males and 21 females with an average age of 67.5 years (range, 52-79 years). The locations were the left side in 28 cases and the right side in 35 cases. The carotid stenosis was 60%-95% (mean, 79%). The major clinical symptoms were stroke and transient ischemic attack. The cranial CT showed old cerebral infarction in 24 cases, lacunar infarction in 22 cases, and no obvious abnormal change in 17 cases. The encephalon, heart, and local complications were compared between 2 groups within 7 days after operation. RESULTS: In CEA group, encephalon complications occurred in 3 cases (8.3%), heart complications in 2 cases (5.6%), and local complications in 5 cases (13.9%); while in CAS group, encephalon complications occurred in 8 cases (29.6%), heart complications in 1 case (3.7%), and local complications in 3 cases (11.1%). The encephalon complication ratio of CAS group was significantly higher than that of CEA group (chi2 = 4.855, P = 0.028); and there was no significant difference in other complications ratios between 2 groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: CEA is the first choice to treat carotid artery stenosis.
