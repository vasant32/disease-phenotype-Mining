The indication for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS) has not been established, although the beneficial effects of these surgical treatments for severe cervical carotid stenosis have been confirmed by clinical trial studies. We report our clinical results of CAS and CEA and suggest an appropriate treatment strategy, especially for high-risk patients. From January 2001 to December 2009, we treated 171 carotid lesions by CEA and 251 lesions by CAS. Stenosis was symptomatic in 68%, and the average stenotic rate was 83% in the CEA group. In the CAS group, stenosis was symptomatic in 62%, and the average stenotic rate was 65%. Stenosis was relieved in all cases after CEA or CAS. Surgical mortality with CEA and CAS was 0.6% (1/171) and 0.4% (1/251), respectively. Surgical morbidity by ischemic stroke with CEA and CAS was 2.9% (5/171) and 1.2% (3/251), respectively. Surgical morbidity was not increased in patients with medical risk factors. The long-term outcome after CAS was not inferior to that after CEA. In conclusion, carotid stenosis can be treated with comparably low morbidity and mortality rates using CEA or CAS even in high-risk patients when the method is appropriately selected considering the characteristics of the carotid stenosis.
