Abstract Inflammatory markers may help establish the diagnosis of carotid atherosclerotic disease and predict the progression and outcomes. We evaluated inflammatory markers in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe carotid artery stenosis, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), leukocyte count, leukocyte subgroups, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. There were 32 symptomatic and 16 asymptomatic patients (age ? 50Â years) with moderate to severe carotid stenosis detected by color Doppler ultrasonography, and 22 individuals without atherosclerotic findings on Doppler ultrasonography. The mean hs-CRP was significantly greater in the symptomatic (p = 0.001) and asymptomatic (p ? 0.001) patients than control subjects; there was no significant difference between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in mean hs-CRP values. Compared with control subjects, asymptomatic patients had greater mean leukocyte count (p = 0.016). Compared with control subjects, symptomatic patients had greater mean neutrophil count (p = 0.012), monocyte count (p = 0.021), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p = 0.001). The hs-CRP was associated with moderate to severe carotid artery stenosis, but it did not differentiate symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
