Severe carotid stenosis may be associated with uncommon clinical symptoms. We report a case of ocular ischemic syndrome and subsequent rubeosis iridis due to a high-grade carotid stenosis. The patient recovered visual acuity and his normal iris coloring after carotid endarterectomy. Rubeosis iridis may be the only clinical sign associated with severe carotid stenosis, making it mandatory to rule out the presence of carotid narrowing when it is detected. Establishing an early diagnosis is essential to improve quality of life, prognosis, and patients' outcome.
