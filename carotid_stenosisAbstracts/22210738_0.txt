One-hundred patients were included to evaluate the role of cerebral computed tomography (CT) to improve patient selection in asymptomatic internal carotid stenosis. Symptomatic patients were assigned to group A, asymptomatic patients to group B. A cerebral CT pattern A was observed in groups A and B in 60% and 20%, respectively (P < .0001). Between A and B groups, type 6 plaques were found, respectively, in 26.7% and 7.5% of patients (P = .01); a type 5 in 51.7% and 45% (P = .32) of patients; and a type 4 in 21.7% and 47.5% of patients, respectively (P = .006). Within B group, the association of CT pattern A and histological plaque level 4, 5, and 6 was, respectively, 25% (P = .15), 50% (P = .53), and 25% (P = .16). In group B, a 7-fold risk increase in CT pattern A was found in patients with level 6 plaque. In asymptomatic patients with high-risk plaque, a basal cerebral CT scan can be used as diagnostic tool to improve patient selection for intervention.
