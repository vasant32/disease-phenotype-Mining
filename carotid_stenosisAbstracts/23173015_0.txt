Carotid artery stenosis is a disabling disease in all age groups. Elderly people are more prone to recurrent strokes due to advancing age and multiple co-morbidities. Treatment options for symptomatic carotid stenosis in the very elderly are the same as in younger patients although with a higher operative risk. We describe a successful case of carotid artery stenting in a nonagenarian with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis, a subgroup for whom treatment options are rarely discussed in guidelines.
