Successful hybrid treatment of the total symptomatic acute occlusion of a common carotid artery (CCA) concomitant to ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis has only been described once in the literature to date. The management of this anatomic distribution of disease can be a challenge both to plan and perform. The aim of this paper is to report an original hybrid revascularization technique for the treatment of two patients with symptomatic CCA acute occlusion and ipsilateral ICA stenosis. Details of the surgical technique and mid-term follow-up are provided.
