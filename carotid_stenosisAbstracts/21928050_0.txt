 BACKGROUND: Platelets are involved in atherosclerosis. Mean platelet volume (MPV) could be a marker of platelet activation. We aim to determine whether MPV levels were correlated with the presence of atherosclerotic disease in carotid arteries of patients with stroke. METHODS: We recruited 215 patients with atherothrombotic stroke. All the participants underwent ultrasonographic evaluation of their extracranial carotid arteries. MPV was measured in automated hematology analysis system. The subjects were divided according to plaques and severity of carotid stenosis. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses and a ROC curve to predict carotid stenosis were performed. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed a positive relationship between MPV and the degree of carotid atherosclerosis (p < 0.00007), and with carotid intima to media thickness (p < 0.00002). In ROC curve, a MPV cut-off of 11.25 fl was obtained for a sensibility of 70% and a specificity of 71% (p < 0.02). Multivariate analysis showed significant correlation with severity of carotid stenosis, when MPV was higher than 11.25 fl (OR: 2.9, p < 0.00007). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that an elevated MPV could be an easily measurable marker of severity of carotid stenosis in patients with atherothrombotic stroke.
