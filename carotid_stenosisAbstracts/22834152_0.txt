The experimental samplings consisted of 25 patients with severe course of hypertension disease in aggregate with atherogenic carotid stenosis before and after carotid endarterectomy and 21 donors. The study was organized to analyze in lipid profile blood serum the content of malonic dialdehyde, ceruloplasmin, alpha-tocopherol, nitric oxide and angiotensin converting enzyme. The study established that in patients took place a reliably increased level of malonic dialdehyde, ceruloplasmin, alpha-tocopherol, nitric oxide and angiotensin converting enzyme. The patients with this pathology have a reliable positive correlation between the concentration of malonic dialdehydeand lipoproteids of very low density (r = 0.51), malonic dialdehyde and triglycerides (r = 0.36), malonic dialdehyde and cholesterol (r = 0.3). This data confirms the important role of peroxidation of lipids in the development of atherosclerosis. Therefore, the enhancement of oxidation stress and expressed dislipoproteidemia are established in patients with hypertension disease with carotids atherosclerosis as a background. This result testifies the pathogenic significance of these phenomena in the mechanisms of homeostasis disorders.
