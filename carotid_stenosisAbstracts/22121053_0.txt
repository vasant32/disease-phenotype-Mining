Takayasu arteritis is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease of medium- and large-sized arteries which frequently affects the major supra-aortic vessels. Morbidity and mortality with both medical and surgical treatments for this disease are high. In the past decade, angioplasty and stenting has emerged as a reasonable alternative to treatment of stenoses in these patients. Restenosis rates of percutaneously treated Takayasu lesions have been higher than with non-inflammatory lesions. Novel approaches are being sought to treat restenoses in these patients, such as the use of a stent grafts. Such a case is described in this report.
