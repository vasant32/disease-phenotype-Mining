 OBJECTIVES: Surgical treatment of carotid stenosis after the onset of ischaemic symptoms should be performed within 2 weeks. This aim was accomplished only in 11% during the years 2007-2008 in the Helsinki University Central Hospital (HUCH) region. Since then, special efforts have been made in order to shorten the delay. The aim of this study was to find out how these changes affected the symptom-to-knife time (SKT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: All symptomatic patients (n = 144) who had carotid endarterectomy (CEA, n = 145) in HUCH in 2010 were retrospectively analysed and the SKT was determined. RESULTS: Of the operations, 37% (n = 53) were performed within the recommended 2 weeks. The median SKT was 19 days (1-183). Of the patients who came to HUCH on an emergency basis (n = 80), 55% (n = 45) were operated within 2 weeks and their median SKT was 13 days (1-148). CONCLUSIONS: The changes that were made in 2008-2009 have significantly shortened the delay in the treatment of carotid stenosis, but the desired time frame of 2 weeks was reached far too seldom. The greatest benefit from preventive CEA is achieved when patients are referred emergently to a clinic where neurologist, imaging resources and vascular surgeon are available.
