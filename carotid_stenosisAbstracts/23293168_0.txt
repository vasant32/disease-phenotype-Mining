 BACKGROUND: We aimed to compare the outcomes of patients who underwent carotid artery stenting (CAS) followed by coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with the outcomes of those who underwent isolated CABG without carotid intervention. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, conducted between March 2007 and February 2010, all patients who had significant carotid artery stenosis (>70%) and were candidates for CABG were included. The outcome measures, including 30-day post-stenting complications, cardiac surgery neurological complications, myocardial infarction (MI), and mortality rates, were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 112 patients underwent CABG without carotid artery intervention and 62 patients were scheduled for CAS + CABG. The death and MI or stroke rates in the CAS + CABG patients and isolated CABG group were 9.7% and 6.3%, respectively (P=.18). In the CAS + CABG group, 4 patients (6.4%) were complicated by ipsilateral stroke, 2 (3.2%) by MI, and 3 (4.8%) by death; 2 deaths had neurological causes and 1 death had a cardiac cause. In the isolated CABG group, 4 stroke cases (3.6%) were diagnosed in the postoperative period, 2 of them (1.8%) being ipsilateral. Also, 1 MI case (0.9%) and 4 deaths (3.6%) occurred after cardiac surgery; 2 deaths had neurological causes and the remaining 2 deaths resulted from other postoperative complications (mediastinitis and arrhythmia). CONCLUSION: The risk of ipsilateral stroke in the isolated CABG approach in patients with concomitant coronary and carotid stenosis is small, and there is no evidence that this risk is lessened by prophylactic CAS. Staged CAS + CABG may become the preferred option in patients with symptomatic bilateral carotid stenosis with stable cardiac status if it is conducted in a high-volume center by experienced operators.
