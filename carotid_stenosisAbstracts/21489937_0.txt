Atheromatous plaques are dynamic structures undergoing continuous remodeling. Duplex ultrasound is now an accepted technique to classify the severity of arterial stenoses. It gives information about the ultrasonic echogenicity of tissue, the plaque surface and the velocity of blood flowing through vessels with the latest equipment. We report the case of a 59-year-old male patient with left hemispheric stroke and a 50% left carotid artery stenosis whose remodeling and reabsorption developed throughout three months from the onset of symptoms. Plaque surface and structural echomorphology assessment and standardization, along with the degree of carotid stenosis, might be helpful in identifying patients most likely to benefit from carotid endarterectomy.
