<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-two healthy adult Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into four groups of eight each: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, NS, model I, model II groups in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> model was established through 2-,4-,6-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48110">trinitrobenzene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29214">sulfonic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi>) enema </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the end of four weeks, the macroscopical and histological changes of the colon were examined and mucosa myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities assayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NF-kappaB p65 expression was determined by Western blot assessment in cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of colon tissue, and the expressions of TNF-alpha and ICAM-1 protein in colon tissue were examined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relativities between expression of NF-kappaB p65 and other parameters were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi> enema resulted in pronounced pathological changes of colonic mucosa in model II group (macroscopic and histological injury indices 6.25+/-1.39 and 6.24+/-1.04, respectively), which were in accordance with the significantly elevated MPO activity (1.69+/-0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>And the nuclear level of NF-kappaB and expression of TNF-alpha, ICAM-1 in rats of model II group were higher than that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control (9.7+/-1.96 vs 1.7+/-0.15, 84.09+/-14.52 vs 16.03+/-6.21, 77.69+/-8.09 vs 13.41+/-4.91 P&lt;0.01), Linear correlation analysis revealed that there were strong correlations between the nuclear level of NF-kappaB and the tissue positive expression of TNF-alpha and ICAM-1, MPO activities, macroscopical and histological indices in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, respectively (r = 0.8235, 0.8780, 0.8572, 0.9152, 0.8247; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NF-kappaB plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, which might account for the up-regulation the expression of TNF-alpha and ICAM-1 </plain></SENT>
