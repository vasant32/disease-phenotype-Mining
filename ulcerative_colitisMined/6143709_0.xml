<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each group contained 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> activity index (UCAI), the remission and relapse rates were compared at three monthly intervals for one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The UCAI fell in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Detailed analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinical and biochemical parameters used for estimation of UCAI showed that the only difference was in patients receiving combined therapy who continued to have a raised ESR and platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fewer patients, however, went into remission on levamisole therapy (46.6%) compared with the other two groups (66.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cumulative relapse rate was 20% for those receiving levamisole compared with 6.6% in the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Side effects were observed in 20% of patients receiving levamisole, 26% receiving sulphasalazine, and 40% in those having combined therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that levamisole is unlikely to have a major role in the management of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
