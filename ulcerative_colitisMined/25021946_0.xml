<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no previous systematic review and meta-analysis has assessed the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of this investigation in comparison with colonoscopy and histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore aim to present these data here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched to January 2014 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prospective and retrospective cross-sectional studies recruiting adults suspected of a new diagnosis or flare of IBD, and comparing Tc-99m HMPAO labelled WCS with colonoscopy and histology, were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>True positive, false positive, true negative and false negative findings were pooled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A random effects model was used to obtain overall data for sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values with a 95% confidence interval (CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 15 eligible studies reporting data from 635 patients (174 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 164 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, 136 non-IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In total 1300 bowel segments were examined with 698 true positives, 41 false positives, 461 true negatives and 100 false negatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity was 0.90 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.95), specificity was 0.91 (95% CI 0.87 to 0.94), positive predictive value was 0.95 (95% CI 0.92 to 0.97) and negative predictive value was 0.83 (0.76 to 0.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Tc-99m HMPAO labelled WCS is a sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Physicians may therefore find this a useful test for those in whom colonoscopy and histology are impractical or contraindicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DISCLOSURE OF INTEREST: None Declared </plain></SENT>
