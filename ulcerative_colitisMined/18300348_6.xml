<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, a total of 50 rats were divided equally into 5 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the control group, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> induction or drug administration was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>Colitis</z:hpo> was induced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following the induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, BBS, NTS or both were applied to three groups of rats </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the 11th d after induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and drug treatment, blood samples were collected for TNF-alpha and IL-6 level studies </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to the macroscopic and microscopic findings, the study groups treated with BBS, NTS and BBS + NTS showed significantly lower damage and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> compared with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> group (macroscopic score, 2.1 +/- 0.87, 3.7 +/- 0.94 and 2.1 +/- 0.87 vs 7.3 +/- 0.94; microscopic score, 2.0 +/- 0.66, 3.3 +/- 0.82 and 1.8 +/- 0.63 vs 5.2 +/- 0.78, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels were increased significantly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These increases were significantly smaller in the BBS, NTS and BBS + NTS groups compared with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> group (TNF-alpha levels, 169.69 +/- 53.56, 245.86 +/- 64.85 and 175.54 +/- 42.19 vs 556.44 +/- 49.82; IL-6 levels, 443.30 +/- 53.99, 612.80 +/- 70.39 and 396.80 +/- 78.43 vs 1505.90 +/- 222.23, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The colonic MPO and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels were significantly lower in control, BBS, NTS and BBS + NTS groups than in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> group (MPO levels, 24.36 +/- 8.10, 40.51 +/- 8.67 and 25.83 +/- 6.43 vs 161.47 +/- 38.24; <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels, 4.70 +/- 1.41, 6.55 +/- 1.12 and 4.51 +/- 0.54 vs 15.60 +/- 1.88, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest BBS and NTS, through their anti-inflammatory actions, support the maintenance of colonic integrity and merit consideration as potential agents for ameliorating colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
