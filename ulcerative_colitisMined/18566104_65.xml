<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to establish the relationship of CRP levels to disease extent in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and to phenotype in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, and to investigate the predictive value of CRP levels for disease outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CRP was measured at diagnosis and after 1 and 5 years in patients diagnosed with IBD in south-eastern Norway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 5 years, 454 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 200 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> were alive and provided sufficient data for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> had a stronger CRP response than did those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, CRP levels at diagnosis increased with increasing extent of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences in CRP levels at diagnosis were found between subgroups of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> as defined according to the Vienna classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> with extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, CRP levels above 23 mg/l at diagnosis predicted an increased risk of surgery (odds ratio (OR) 4.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5 to 15.1, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, CRP levels above 10 mg/l after 1 year predicted an increased risk of surgery during the subsequent 4 years (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.1 to 7.8, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant association between CRP levels at diagnosis and risk of surgery was found in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and terminal <z:mp ids='MP_0009482'>ileitis</z:mp> (L1), and the risk increased when CRP levels were above 53 mg/l in this subgroup (OR 6.0, 95% CI 1.1 to 31.9, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CRP levels at diagnosis were related to the extent of disease in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Phenotype had no influence on CRP levels in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CRP is a predictor of surgery in subgroups of patients with either <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
