<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The CD40/CD40L system, a key regulator and amplifier of immune reactivity, is activated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine whether plasma levels of sCD40L are elevated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) patients compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, to investigate the cellular source of sCD40L, and to explore CD40L induction mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: CD, UC, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The concentration of sCD40L in plasma and supernatants of freshly isolated platelets and autologous peripheral blood T cells (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53322">PBT</z:chebi>) was measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surface CD40L expression level was measured by flow cytometry in resting and thrombin activated platelets, and unstimulated and CD3/CD28 stimulated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53322">PBT</z:chebi> before and after coculture with human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells (HIMEC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, plasma sCD40L levels were significantly higher in both CD and UC patients and proportional to the extent of mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Platelets from IBD patients displayed a significantly higher surface CD40L expression than those from control subjects, and released greater amounts of sCD40L than autologous <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53322">PBT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Contact with IL-1beta activated HIMEC induced significant upregulation of CD40L surface expression and release by platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated levels of sCD40L in the circulation of IBD patients reflect enhanced surface expression and release of CD40L by platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon translates to an increased platelet activation state apparently induced by passage through an inflamed mucosal microvascular bed, a conclusion supported by the positive correlation of plasma sCD40L levels with the extent of anatomical involvement by IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that platelet-endothelial interactions critically contribute to activation of the CD40 pathway in IBD </plain></SENT>
