<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of IFN-beta-1a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients (n=18) with moderately active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> were randomised to receive IFN-beta-1a or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IFN-beta-1a was started at a dose of 22 micro g three times a week subcutaneously, and the dose was increased at two week intervals to 44 micro g and then to 88 micro g if no response was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The maximum duration of treatment was eight weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>End points were clinical treatment response, defined as a decrease of at least 3 points from baseline in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> scoring system (UCSS) symptoms score and induction of endoscopically confirmed remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline characteristics and disease severity were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data from 17 patients are included in this report (10 patients in the IFN-beta-1a group and seven patients in the placebo group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical response was achieved in five patients (50%) in the IFN-beta-1a group and in one (14%) in the placebo group (P=0.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Remission was achieved in three patients in the IFN-beta-1a group and in none in the placebo group (p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most adverse reactions associated with IFN-beta-1a were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e>-like symptoms or injection site reactions, and were mild or moderate in severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IFN-beta-1a may represent a promising novel treatment approach in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
