<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From counts carried out in 160 jejunal biopsies from patients who did not have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coeliac disease</z:e> the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range has been established as 6-40 intraepithelial lymphocytes per 100 villous epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In some biopsies there was a moderate increase in the intraepithelial lymphocyte count; this was probably an objective measurement of ;increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory cell infiltrate' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intraepithelial lymphocyte counts were high in untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coeliac disease</z:e>; counts were lower, but rarely within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, in coeliac patients on a gluten-free diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Counts were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in most <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were abnormal intraepithelial lymphocyte counts in four patients, with otherwise <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> jejunal histology, in whom no cause had been found to explain prolonged and incapacitating gastrointestinal symptoms </plain></SENT>
