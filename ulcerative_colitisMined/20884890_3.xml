<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that angiogenic cytokines contribute to this <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> that facilitates the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> nature of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported (Goebel S, Huang M, Davis WC, Jennings M, Siahaan TJ, Alexander JS, Kevil CG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol 290: G648-G654, 2006) that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A can stimulate neutrophil <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to colon microvascular endothelial cells in a β₂-integrin (Itgb2)-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, it is not known which of the specific leukocyte integrins are critical for VEGF-A-dependent neutrophil and T cell recruitment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we examine the differential importance of either α-integrin (Itga)L or ItgaM in governing neutrophil and T cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to VEGF-A-activated colonic endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using an in vitro parallel-plate flow chamber model, we found that genetic deficiency of ItgaM completely blunted neutrophil <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to VEGF-A-stimulated endothelium, whereas ItgaL deficiency only partly blocked neutrophil <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Deficiency of ItgaM did significantly decrease neutrophil rolling, whereas deficiency of ItgaL did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that genetic deficiency of either ItgaL or ItgaM did significantly blunt T cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to VEGF-A-stimulated colon endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also found that genetic deficiency of these Itgas significantly attenuated T cell rolling behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lastly, we examined whether VEGF-A-mediated leukocyte recruitment occurred through different VEGF receptor (VEGFR) pathways and found that VEGFR2 activation regulates neutrophil recruitment, whereas both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 modulate T cell recruitment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Together, these data identify differential molecular mechanisms of VEGF-A-mediated leukocyte recruitment </plain></SENT>
