<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data on the association between dietary fat and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) are limited and conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diet was prospectively ascertained every 4 years using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Self-reported CD and UC were confirmed through medical record review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of energy-adjusted cumulative average total fat intake and specific types of fat and fatty acids on the risk of CD and UC using Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 170,805 women, we confirmed 269 incident cases of CD (incidence 8/100,000 person-years) and 338 incident cases of UC (incidence 10/100,000 person-years) over 26 years and 3,317,338 person-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cumulative energy-adjusted intake of total fat, saturated fats, unsaturated fats, n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were not associated with risk of CD or UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, greater intake of long-chain n-3 PUFAs was associated with a trend towards lower risk of UC (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, high long-term intake of trans-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="27208">unsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi> was associated with a trend towards an increased incidence of UC (HR 1.34, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A high intake of dietary long-chain n-3 PUFAs may be associated with a reduced risk of UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, high intake of trans-unsaturated fats may be associated with an increased risk of UC </plain></SENT>
