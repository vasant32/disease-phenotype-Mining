<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Paediatric patients often manifest more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849867" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">extensive disease</z:e> and a particularly severe disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is likely that genetic predisposition plays a more substantial role in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify the spectrum of rare and novel variation in known IBD susceptibility genes using exome sequencing analysis in eight individual cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011463'>childhood onset</z:hpo> severe disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: DNA samples from the eight patients underwent targeted exome capture and sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were processed through an analytical pipeline to align sequence reads, conduct quality checks, and identify and annotate variants where patient sequence differed from the reference sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For each patient, the entire complement of rare variation within strongly associated candidate genes was catalogued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Across the panel of 169 known IBD susceptibility genes, approximately 300 variants in 104 genes were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Excluding splicing and HLA-class variants, 58 variants across 39 of these genes were classified as rare, with an alternative allele frequency of &lt;5%, of which 17 were novel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only two patients with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> exhibited rare deleterious variations within NOD2: the previously described R702W variant was the sole NOD2 variant in one patient, while the second patient also carried the L1007 frameshift insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both patients harboured other potentially damaging mutations in the GSDMB, ERAP2 and SEC16A genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The two patients severely affected with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> exhibited a distinct profile: both carried potentially detrimental variation in the BACH2 and IL10 genes not seen in other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: For each of the eight individuals studied, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> non-synonymous, truncating and frameshift mutations across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known IBD genes were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A unique profile of rare and potentially damaging variants was evident for each patient with this complex disease </plain></SENT>
