<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Pancreatic antibodies occur in about one third of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To evaluate the relevance of pancreatic antibodies as a genetic marker in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and their first degree family members and spouses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To characterise further pancreatic antibodies by assessment of IgG subclasses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six hundred and fifty serum samples were tested for pancreatic antibodies by immunofluorescence on sections of human pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incidence of pancreatic antibodies and their subtypes were studied on 212 serum samples from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the familial study, 72 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and 196 first degree family members and 26 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 90 first degree family members were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten healthy families served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pancreatic antibodies were found in 58 (27%) of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and in none of the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients had pancreatic antibodies of subtype I characterised by a drop-like fluorescence in the pancreatic acini, 28 patients had subtype II with a fine speckled staining in the acinar cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pancreatic antibodies of subtype I were both IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies by contrast with subtype II which were mainly of IgG1 subclass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only five of 196 first degree relatives of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> had pancreatic antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four of these people had anamnestic data compatible with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further investigations showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> in two of these people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In families with more than one member positive for pancreatic antibodies, pancreatic antibodies were of the same subtype in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic antibodies are a specific marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Two subgroups of pancreatic antibodies can be distinguished by their pattern and immunoglobulin subclasses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Pancreatic antibodies rarely occur in family members of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These family members may also have <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
