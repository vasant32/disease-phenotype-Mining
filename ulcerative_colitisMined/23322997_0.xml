<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The studied population comprised 639 subjects, including patients with UC (UC cases, n = 174) and subjects without UC (controls, n = 465) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We employed polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism to detect the gene polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rs72696119 G allele frequencies in controls and UC cases were 33.4% and 38.5%, respectively (P = 0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotype frequency of the GG homozygote in UC cases was significantly higher than that in controls (P = 0.017), and the GG homozygote was significantly associated with susceptibility to UC [odds ratio (OR), 1.88; 95%CI, 1.13-3.14] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In male subjects, the GG homozygote was associated with an increased risk for UC (OR, 3.10; 95%CI, 1.47-6.54; P = 0.0053), whereas this association was not found in female subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the GG homozygote was significantly associated with the risk of non-continuous disease (OR, 2.06; 95%CI, 1.12-3.79; P = 0.029), not having total <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (OR, 2.40; 95%CI, 1.09-3.80, P = 0.040), disease which developed before 20 years of age (OR, 2.80; 95%CI, 1.07-7.32, P = 0.041), no hospitalization (OR, 2.28; 95%CI, 1.29-4.05; P = 0.0090) and with a maximum of 8 or less on the UCDAI score (OR, 2.45; 95%CI, 1.23-4.93; P = 0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results provide evidence that NFKB1 polymorphism rs72696119 was significantly associated with the development of UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This polymorphism influences the susceptibility to and pathophysiological features of UC </plain></SENT>
