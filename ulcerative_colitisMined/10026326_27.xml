<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Decreased synthesis of the predominant secretory human colonic mucin (MUC2) occurs during active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To study possible alterations in mucin sulphation and mucin secretion, which could be the cause of decreased mucosal protection in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Colonic biopsy specimens from patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in remission, and controls were metabolically labelled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">[35S]</z:chebi>-amino acids or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">[35S]</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi>, chase incubated and analysed by <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE, followed by quantitation of mature <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">[35S]</z:chebi>-labelled MUC2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For quantitation of total MUC2, which includes non-radiolabelled and radiolabelled MUC2, dot blotting was performed, using a MUC2 monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between patient groups, no significant differences were found in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">[35S]</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> content of secreted MUC2 or in the secreted percentage of either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">[35S]</z:chebi>-amino acid labelled MUC2 or total MUC2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, secretion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">[35S]</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> labelled MUC2 was significantly increased twofold, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">[35S]</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> incorporation into MUC2 was significantly reduced to half </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: During active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, less MUC2 is secreted, because MUC2 synthesis is decreased while the secreted percentage of MUC2 is unaltered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> content of secreted MUC2 is unaltered by a specific compensatory mechanism, because sulphated MUC2 is preferentially secreted while <z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> incorporation into MUC2 is reduced </plain></SENT>
