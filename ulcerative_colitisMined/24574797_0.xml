<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Only a very few systematic studies have investigated the frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurologic disorders</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), which are the two main types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results have been inconsistent and variable, owing to differences in case-finding methods and evaluated outcomes in different studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most frequent neurologic manifestations reported in CD and UC populations are cerebrovascular disease (with either arterial or venous events), demyelinating central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disease, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> (whether axonal or demyelinating); however, the literature describes numerous <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disorders as being associated with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system tissue involvement in IBD has yet to be elucidated, although it seems to be related to immune mechanisms or prothrombotic states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The recently-introduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF) inhibitors have proven successful in controlling moderate to severe IBD activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurologic disorders</z:e> associated with TNF inhibitors have been reported, which therefore raises concerns regarding the effect of anti-TNF-Î± antibodies on the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although neurological involvement associated with IBD is rarely reported, gastroenterologists should be aware of the neurologic manifestations of IBD in order to provide early treatment, which is crucial for preventing major neurologic morbidity </plain></SENT>
