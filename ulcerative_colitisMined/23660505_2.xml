<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PEPT1 was proposed not to be expressed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosa but may become detectable in inflammatory states such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reassessed colonic expression of PEPT1 by performing a systematic analysis of PEPT1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels in healthy colonic tissues in mice, rats, and humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence analysis of different mouse strains (C57BL/6N, 129/Sv, BALB/c) demonstrated the presence of PEPT1 in the distal part of the colon but not in proximal colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rat and human intestines display a similar distribution of PEPT1 as found in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, localization in human sigmoid colon revealed immunoreactivity present at low levels in apical membranes but substantial staining in distinct intracellular compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional activity of PEPT1 in colonic tissues from mice was assessed in everted sac preparations using [¹⁴C]Gly-<z:chebi fb="99" ids="15611">Sar</z:chebi> and found to be 5.7-fold higher in distal compared with proximal colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In intestinal tissues from Pept1-/- mice, no [¹⁴C]Gly-<z:chebi fb="99" ids="15611">Sar</z:chebi> transport was detectable but feces samples revealed significantly higher water content than in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, suggesting that PEPT1 contributes to colonic water absorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our studies unequivocally demonstrate the presence of PEPT1 protein in healthy distal colonic epithelium in mice, rats, and humans and proved that the protein is functional and contributes to electrolyte and water handling in mice </plain></SENT>
