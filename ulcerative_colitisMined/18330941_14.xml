<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate if the clinical efficacy of granulocytes and monocytes by adsorption (GMA) is associated with an increased frequency of peripheral regulatory T cells (Tregs), as these cells have proven to be successful in suppressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) in animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We report four cases of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi>-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and two <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) cases with severe cutaneous lesions who received GMA therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of CD4+ CD25(high) (Tregs) in peripheral blood was analyzed by flow cytometry and the expression of FoxP3 and TGF beta in purified CD4+ T cells was determined by real time PCR prior to and one month after the last apheresis session, and at the time of endoscopic and clinical assessing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increased expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016632" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Fox</z:e> P3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients who responded to cytapheresis with remission of clinical symptoms, mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and cutaneous lesions, and an increased frequency of circulating Tregs was found in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These changes were not observed in the patient with UC who did no respond to GMA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Variations in TGF-beta (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) did not parallel that of FoxP3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The clinical efficacy of GMA on IBD and related extra intestinal manifestations was associated with an expansion of circulating CD4+ CD25+ Tregs and higher expression of FoxP3 in CD4+ T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, an elevated CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3 may be a valuable index of remission in patients with IBD and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> relapsing-remitting inflammatory conditions during treatment with GMA </plain></SENT>
