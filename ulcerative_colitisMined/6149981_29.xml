<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, experiments were performed in which the effects of medication on immunoreactive <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> (PG) E2 concentrations in free faecal water were assessed using the equilibrium in vivo dialysis of faeces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Colonic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> concentrations in patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (n = 11) ranged from 2035-18,000 pg/ml to be compared with a range of 103-188 pg/ml in healthy volunteers (n = 10; p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> healthy volunteers <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> concentrations decreased slightly (p less than 0.05) after disodium azodisalicylate intake 2 g/day, whereas low dose disodium azodisalicylate (0.25 g/day) caused no change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in complete clinical, sigmoidoscopic, and histologic remission withdrawal of sulphasalazine (2 g/day; n = 6) increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> concentrations to values above <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels (p less than 0.05) which returned to pretrial values (p less than 0.05) on disodium azodisalicylate (2 g/day; n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> in free faecal water indicates an abnormality in the colonic mucosa, even in the absence of conventional signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We could not confirm the hypothesis that sulphasalazine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi> exert their therapeutic effect through promotion of endogenous cytoprotective <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the observation that raised <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> concentrations were normalised by disodium azodisalicylate in patients with inactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> suggests that subclinical disease activity was decreased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
