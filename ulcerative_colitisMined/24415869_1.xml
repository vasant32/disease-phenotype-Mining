<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum and urine samples were collected from 24 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), 19 patients with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and 17 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The activity of UC was assessed with the Simple Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>Colitis</z:hpo> Activity Index, while the activity of CD was determined using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analysis of serum and urine samples was performed using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> spectra were exported to Matlab for preprocessing which resulted in two data matrixes for serum and urine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prior to the chemometric analysis, both data sets were unit variance scaled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The differences in metabolite fingerprints were assessed using partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PLS</z:e>-<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic curves and area under curves were used to evaluate the quality and prediction performance of the obtained <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PLS</z:e>-<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Metabolites responsible for separation in models were tested using STATISTICA 10 with the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test and the Student's t test (Î± = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The comparison between the group of patients with active IBD and the group with IBD in remission provided good <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PLS</z:e>-<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> models (P value 0.002 for serum and 0.003 for urine) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The metabolites that allowed to distinguish these groups were: N-acetylated compounds and phenylalanine (up-regulated in serum), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoproteins</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39027">very low-density lipoproteins</z:chebi> (decreased in serum) as well as glycine (increased in urine) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13705">acetoacetate</z:chebi> (decreased in urine) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The significant differences in metabolomic profiles were also found between the group of patients with active IBD and healthy control subjects providing the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PLS</z:e>-<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> models with a very good separation (P value &lt; 0.001 for serum and 0.003 for urine) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The metabolites that were found to be the strongest biomarkers included in this case: leucine, isoleucine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="20067">3-hydroxybutyric acid</z:chebi>, N-acetylated compounds, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13705">acetoacetate</z:chebi>, glycine, phenylalanine and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> (increased in serum), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9349">dimethyl sulfone</z:chebi>, histidine, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> and its derivatives (decreased in serum), as well as <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi>, hippurate, trigonelline, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi>, succinate and 2-hydroxyisobutyrate (decreased in urine) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No clear separation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PLS</z:e>-<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> models was found between CD and UC patients based on the analysis of serum and urine samples, although one metabolite (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15740,52343">formate</z:chebi>) in univariate statistical analysis was significantly lower in serum of patients with active CD, and two metabolites (alanine and N-acetylated compounds) were significantly higher in serum of patients with CD when comparing jointly patients in the remission and active phase of the diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Contrary to the results obtained from the serum samples, the analysis of urine samples allowed to distinguish patients with IBD in remission from healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The metabolites of importance included in this case up-regulated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13705">acetoacetate</z:chebi> and down-regulated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi>, hippurate, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi>, succinate, glycine, alanine and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15740,52343">formate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NMR-based metabolomic fingerprinting of serum and urine has the potential to be a useful tool in distinguishing patients with active IBD from those in remission </plain></SENT>
