<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DNA analyses were performed using flow cytometric analyses in biopsies and microspectrophotometry in imprint slides prepared from the biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Abnormal aneuploid DNA content was detected in five of the patients in eight separate locations in the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was good conformity between the two methods in the detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both methods of DNA analysis are considered to be applicable in mucosal biopsies from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In two patients with significant low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in association with macroscopical lesions (DALMs), there was a relationship with aneuploid DNA pattern found by flow cytometric or microspectrophotometric analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indefinite changes, probably dysplastic were found in three other patients and two of those also displayed <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>, although only once in the same biopsy location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In five locations <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> was detected without concomitant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DNA-<z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> seems therefore to appear earlier than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and may be an early marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> of the mucosa in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prospective trials are needed before the clinical significance of early findings of <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> can be determined </plain></SENT>
