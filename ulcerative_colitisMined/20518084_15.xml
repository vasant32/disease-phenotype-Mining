<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy provides a direct evaluation of mucosal lesions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD), permitting the description of elementary lesions, their surface extent and severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The severity of mucosal lesions directly reflects disease activity and may help to identify an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behavior</z:hpo> of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several studies have recently pointed out the potential role of endoscopy in the prediction of IBD outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indeed, severe endoscopic lesions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) patients, defined by deep and extensive ulcerations on at least one part of the colon, are associated with an increased risk of penetrating complication and surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Severe endoscopic lesions during severe attacks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) are associated with an increased risk of colectomy in the short and long term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Severity of postoperative recurrence in CD may help to predict the risk of clinical relapse and need for further surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Achievement of mucosal healing, which can be obtained by administration of several types of drugs, is associated with a better outcome, less surgery and hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This review focuses on the assessment of endoscopic severity in CD and UC and on the impact of endoscopic severity on disease outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More specifically, we discuss how endoscopy can be used at different stages of IBD to predict the disease course and/or to adapt treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
