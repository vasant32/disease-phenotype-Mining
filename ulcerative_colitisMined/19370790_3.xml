<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At that time, he was on maintenance treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> at a dose of 1.25 mg/kg per day, and had not received supplementary steroids for 9 mo </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Shortly after apparently effective treatment with intravenous steroids and an increased dose of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>, he developed worsening colitic and new respiratory symptoms, and was diagnosed with Pneumocystis jiroveci (carinii) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pneumomediastinum is rare in immunocompetent hosts, but is a recognized complication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e> in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus (HIV) patients, although our patient's HIV test was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e> with co-trimoxazole resulted in resolution of both respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, without the need to increase the steroid dose </plain></SENT>
