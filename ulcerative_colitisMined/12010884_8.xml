<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Little is known of the permeability of ileoanal pouches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hence the aim of the present study was to determine changes in permeability and mucosal function after ileo-pouchanal anastomosis (IPAA) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Biopsies were taken from 43 patients (male:female ratio 28:15; mean age 35.2 (12.5) years) prior to colectomy (ileum prior to pouch), prior to closure of ileostomy (deviation), and after closure of ileostomy (intact pouch) in the case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e>, and from 14 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tissues were mounted in a miniaturised Ussing chamber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Epithelial and subepithelial resistance was determined by transmural impedance analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Active <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> cotransport was measured as change in short circuit current after stepwise addition of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and active Cl(-) secretion was measured after stimulation with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28177">theophylline</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> E(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neither epithelial resistance nor <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> fluxes were significantly altered compared with intact controls, indicating no barrier defect in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subepithelial resistances of intact pouches and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> were increased compared with deviation (18.2 (1.6) and 24.3 (1.5) v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>13.6 (1.0) Omegaxcm(2)) consistent with an adaptive thickening of the subepithelial layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, active Cl(-) secretion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> tissues was reduced versus intact pouch and controls (1.4 (0.3) v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>4.3 (0.7) and 4.6 (0.7) micromol/h/cm(2)), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> cotransport of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> was reduced compared with intact pouch and controls (1.8 (0.5) v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>4.2 (0.8) and 8.8 (1.3) micromol/h/cm(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ileal mucosa in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> and terminal ileum prior to IPAA exhibit impaired secretory and absorptive transport functions whereas the epithelial barrier function remains unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This differs from findings in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thus the hypothesis that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> represents a remanifestation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> has to be questioned </plain></SENT>
