<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bisphosphonate-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>osteonecrosis</z:hpo> of the jaw (BRONJ) is a feared side effect which is hard to treat and often affects patient's quality of life in an extensive manner </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: In March 2013, a 36-year-old female presented with right-sided perimandibular swelling, recurrent facial pain and exposed necrotic bone after previous extraction of tooth 47 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She had the medical history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> for more than one decade with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> active <z:hpo ids='HP_0004387'>enterocolitis</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> disease as well as previous oral manifestation and was currently treated with Adalimumab since September 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Due to steroid-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo>, diagnosed in 2004, she received oral Bisphosphonates (Risedronate) from 2004 until 2007 followed by two infusions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46557">Zoledronic acid</z:chebi> in 2008 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This patient with a medical history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and gastrointestinal remission under Adalimumab therapy presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>osteonecrosis</z:hpo> of the jaw after suspended oral and intravenous Bisphosphonate therapy implicating that the biologic therapy with an anti-TNF-α antibody might promote the manifestation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>osteonecrosis</z:hpo> and compromise oral healing capacity </plain></SENT>
