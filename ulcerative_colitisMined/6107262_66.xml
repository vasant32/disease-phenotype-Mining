<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A survey has been made of pregnancy occurring in patients who were attending the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative Colitis</z:hpo> Clinic at Oxford during the 20-year period, 1960-79 inclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 256 married women of child-bearing age who attended during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, 100 were excluded from the survey for various reasons, such as that they had completed their family before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, had already had an hysterectomy, or had a proctocolectomy before their first pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 156 patients, nine could not be traced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Full details were obtained from 147 patients, virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom were interviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fertility of these patients was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 147 women, 119 (81%) had conceived and only 10 (6.8%) were involuntarily <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>infertile</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The size of family approximated to that found in the general British population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall outcome of the pregnancies was similar to that in the general British population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients in whom the disease was quiescent at the start of pregnancy fared particularly well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Those with active disease had a somewhat lower chance of producing a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> live baby </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The small group of patients in whom the disease was severe had a much lower chance of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients in whom the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> was quiescent at the beginning of pregnancy had a good chance of remaining symptom-free throughout the pregnancy and puerperium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Even if the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> recurred, it was likely to be mild and responsive to medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>By contrast, when the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> was active at the start of pregnancy, most patients continued to have symptoms in spite of medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Some patients had their first attack of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> during pregnancy or the puerperium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In contrast to previous experience the attacks were generally mild and responded to medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Medical treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> or sulphasalazine appeared to have no obvious deleterious effects on the fetus or new-born child </plain></SENT>
