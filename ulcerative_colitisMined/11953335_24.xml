<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conditions, human gut mucosa is infiltrated with a large number of mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is a reflection of the fact that human intestine is continuously subjected to a massive stimulation by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This state of "physiological" <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is a tightly controlled phenomenon, as several mucosal cells interact to generate and maintain an appropriate local immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes in cell type number and/or function, including the release of soluble mediators, have been associated with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), the two major forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Evidence also indicates that the type of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> occurring in the intestine of patients with CD differs from that in UC, and this probably reflects distinct pathways of immune activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In CD mucosa, a Th1 response with high IL-12 and IFNgamma production prevails, while in UC a humoral immunity appears to be predominant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite this, CD and UC share downstream inflammatory events, characterised by high levels of inflammatory cytokines, free radicals, matrix-degrading enzymes and growth factors </plain></SENT>
