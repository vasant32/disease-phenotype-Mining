<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three preparations of a water soluble fraction (Frazer's fraction III, FIII) of partial peptic tryptic digests of wheat gluten had different effects in a direct (one stage) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subfractions B and B2 caused migration inhibition of leucocytes from patients with treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coeliac disease</z:e> but not of leucocytes from healthy volunteers or patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This migration inhibition seems to be specific for gluten fractions because maize zein fraction B, beta-lactoglobulin and ovalbumin did not cause it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of coeliac leucocytes to fraction B is not related to factors present in coeliac serum as the migration of leucocytes from healthy individuals preincubated with coeliac sera was not inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17939">Puromycin</z:chebi> diminished inhibition by fraction B, which was active at 1.2 micrograms/ml in an indirect (two stage) migration inhibition assay; this is consistent with a process involving elaboration of lymphokine(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More highly purified fractions of B2, P1-P4 were prepared by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and showed differing potency in direct and indirect assays, with P4 being the most active fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of migration by gluten derived <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> appears to result from the release of lymphokine by leucocytes specifically from coeliac patients </plain></SENT>
