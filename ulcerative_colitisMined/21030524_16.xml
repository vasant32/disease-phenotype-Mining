<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> remain the first line treatment, in patients not responding after 3-5 days rescue medical therapy with either intravenous (IV) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> 2 mg/kg or infliximab 5 mg/kg IV should be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Controlled evidence supports the use of both treatments but medical rescue therapy should not defer the decision for colectomy in patients with inadequate response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Providing clear guidance for the choice between both agents is impossible due to the lack of comparative trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The better short-term safety profile and the option for maintenance treatment favour infliximab specifically in patients already exposed to immunosuppressives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of action and the short half-life are advantages of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> in patients with imminent risk of colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Even if <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and probably also infliximab only postpone colectomy in at least half of the patients, elective colectomy in a later stage of the disease may offer better outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whereas prolonged exposure to steroids predisposes to an increased rate of peri-operative complications it is still debated whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> or infliximab increase peri-operative morbidity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
