<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a majority of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> extracts of foetal, colonic, and jejunoileal mucosa inhibit migration of leucocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A similar reactivity is seldom seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Extracts of liver, kidney, and adrenal gland do not inhibit the migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reactivity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> group was found to be significantly different from that in controls and in the Crohn group, whereas the Crohn group did not differ significantly from the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The examination thus reveals a biological difference between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, which are otherwise separable mainly on nosological criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The finding of a similar inhibition of leucocyte migration in five out of 31 patients with miscellaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disorders</z:e> unrelated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> was inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An antigen-induced inhibition of leucocyte migration has been shown in vitro to be a correlate of cellular hypersensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The immunological mechanisms behind the present system are discussed, and it is concluded that the reactivity observed probably indicates the existence in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> of a state of cellular hypersensitivity to components of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> foetal, colonic, and jejunoileal mucosa </plain></SENT>
