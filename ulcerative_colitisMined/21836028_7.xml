<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Manitoba IBD Cohort Study is a longitudinal, population-based study of multiple determinants of health outcomes in an IBD cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants completed semi-annual surveys, and annual in-person interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Enquiries about the use of 12 types of CAM service providers and 13 CAM products, based on items from a national survey, were included at months 0, 12, 30 and 54 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 74% of respondents used a CAM service or product in the 4.5-year period, with approximately 40% using some type of CAM at each time point, and 14% using CAM consistently at every time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a trend for women to use CAM more than men; there was no difference in CAM use between patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most often used CAM services (on average) were massage therapy (30%) and chiropractic (14%), physiotherapy (4%), acupuncture (3.5%) and naturopathy/homeopathy (3.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A wide range of CAM products were used, with Lactobacillus acidophilus (8%), fish and other oils (5.5%), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">glucosamine</z:chebi> (4%) and chamomile (3.5%) as the most common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On average, only 18% of consumers used CAM for their IBD, so the majority chose it for other problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in psychological variables between CAM users and non-users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Those with IBD commonly try CAM, although very few use these approaches regularly over the years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CAM is not usually used by patients with IBD for disease management, but clinicians should be aware that many will test the services and products </plain></SENT>
