<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with IBD have increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because the pathogenesis of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> has not been entirely defined yet and there is no ideal treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> prevention has become increasingly important in patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two adopted methods to prevent the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in clinical practice include the prophylactic colectomy and colonoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>But patients and physicians seldom accept colectomy as a routine preventive method and most patients do not undergo appropriate colonoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chemoprevention refers to the use of natural or synthetic chemical agents to reverse, suppress, or to delay the process of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chemoprevention is a particularly useful method in the management of patients at high risk for the development of specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> based on inborn genetic susceptibility, the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-associated disease, or other known risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> by administration of chemopreventive agents is one of the most promising options for IBD patients who are at increased risks of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The chemopreventive efficacy of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>) against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021841" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intestinal tumors</z:e> has been well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>But with reports that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> aggravated the symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, their sustained use for the purpose of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> chemoprevention has been relatively contraindicated in IBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Another hopeful candidate chemoprevention drug for IBD patients is <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>), which is well tolerated by most patients and has limited systemic adverse effects, and no gastrointestinal toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> lacks the well-known side effects of long-term <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Retrospective correlative studies have suggested that the long-term use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> in IBD patients may significantly reduce the risk of development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>According to the literature, this agent might well satisfy clinical expectations with respect to a safe and effective chemopreventive agent </plain></SENT>
