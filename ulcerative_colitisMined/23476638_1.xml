<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> (IBDs), many symptoms are similar to the functional disorder <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022104" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IBS">irritable bowel syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A challenge is thus to distinguish symptoms of IBD from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the levels of calprotectin in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>-positive IBD patients in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Remission was defined as a simple clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> activity index (SCCAI) or simple <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>crohn's disease</z:hpo> activity index (SCDAI) score of less than three and less than four, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Rome II criteria were used to identify cases, and the calprotectin ELISA test was used to quantify calprotectin in stools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Rome II criteria were fulfilled in 24.6% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) patients, while the comparable number for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) was 21.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a tendency for elevated fecal calprotectin levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>-positive patients, regardless of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, these differences were only significant in CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Calprotectin levels are elevated in subgroups of IBD patients that are in remission and have coexisting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>-like symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This study underscores the clinical usefulness of a noninvasive marker to distinguish patients in need of intensified followup from those that do not need further workup </plain></SENT>
