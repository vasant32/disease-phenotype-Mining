<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen patients with mild and moderately active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> were enrolled in an open-label study of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18145">d-alpha tocopherol</z:chebi> enema (8000 U/d) for 12 wk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were receiving concomitant therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi> derivatives (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>) and/or immunomodulator medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic evaluation was performed at baseline and after 4th and 12th weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was measured with the Mayo disease activity index (DAI) and remission was defined as DAI of &lt; or = 2 with no blood in stool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical response was defined as a DAI reduction of &gt; or = 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the end of 12th week, the average DAI score significantly decreased compared to the beginning of the study (2.3 +/- 0.37 vs 8 +/- 0.48, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient was withdrawn after 3 wk for being unavailable to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the 4th week of therapy, 12 patients showed clinical response, 3 of whom (21.4%) achieving remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 12 wk, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 14 patients responded clinically to the therapy and remission was induced in 9 of them (64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patient reported adverse events or was hospitalized due to worsened disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This preliminary report suggests that rectal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18145">d-alpha tocopherol</z:chebi> may represent a novel therapy for mild and moderately active UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The observed results might be due to the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties of vitamin E </plain></SENT>
