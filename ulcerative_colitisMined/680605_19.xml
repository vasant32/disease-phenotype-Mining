<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A retrospective analysis was undertaken of the records of 107 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> of the colon or with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> who underwent 162 operations under steroid cover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study revealed no correlation between steroid dosage and postoperative morbidity or mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of wound dehiscence and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004872'>incisional hernia</z:hpo> compared favourably with the reports of other unselected series of similar patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Contamination did significantly influence results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Septic complications were more frequent when the operative field was contaminated and both <z:mp ids='MP_0002908'>delayed wound healing</z:mp> and mortality were related to this <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A ;clean and dirty' technique was effective in controlling contamination during elective bowel division but preoperative bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> and accidental entry into the lumen of the bowel during dissection were potentially avoidable sources of contamination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary healing of the perineal wound after proctocolectomy was seldom achieved in contaminated patients where a drain tube was brought out through the main perineal incision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When perineal sinuses or fistulae followed a proctocolectomy, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> had a significantly slower rate of healing than did patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there was no difference in the healing of abdominal wounds in relation to the primary pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Even abdominal incisions which were used on more than one occasion healed as well as those which were used for the first time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A prophylactic antibiotic regime of either <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28971">ampicillin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi> offered little protection against postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The organisms which caused such <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were often insensitive to the two antibiotics </plain></SENT>
