<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The percentage cumulative relapse rate after 12 months' treatment was 30% in the 33 patients treated with sulphasalazine compared with 71% in the 25 treated with high dose <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> cromoglycate, a highly significant difference (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients allocated low dose <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> cromoglycate were only treated for a maximum of six months, and the relapse rate in these 12 patients was similar to that in patients on the high dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that oral <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> cromoglycate is considerably less effective than sulphasalazine in maintaining remission, and by analogy with results in other trials may be no more effective than placebo tablets </plain></SENT>
