<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several techniques have been described for the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010447'>fistula-in-ano</z:hpo>, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> carry their own risks of recurrence and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">incontinence</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a prospective study to assess type of presentation, treatment strategy and outcome over a 5-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1st January 2005 and 31st March 2011,247 patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010447'>anal fistulas</z:hpo> were treated at the University Hospital Tor Vergata and were included in the present prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 47 years (range 16-76 years); minimum follow-up period was 6 months (mean 40, range 6-74 months).Patients were treated using 4 operative approaches: fistulotomy, fistulectomy, seton placement and rectal advancement flap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data analyzed included: age, gender, type of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>, operative intervention, healing rate, postoperative complications, reinterventions and recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Etiologies of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> were cryptoglandular (n = 218), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (n = 26) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative Colitis</z:hpo> (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fistulae were classified as simple -intersphincteric 57 (23%), low transphincteric 28 (11%) and complex -high transphicteric 122 (49%), suprasphincteric 2 (0.8%), extrasphinteric 2 (0.8%), recto-vaginal 7 (2.8%) Crohn 26 (10%) and UC 3 (1.2%).The most common surgical procedure was the placement of seton (62%), usually applied in case of complex fistulae and Crohn's patients.Eighty-five patients (34%) underwent fistulotomy, mainly for intersphincteric and mid/low transphincteric tracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Crohn's patients were submitted to placement of one or more loose setons.The main treatment successfully eradicated the primary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> tract in 151/247 patients (61%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three cases of major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">incontinence</z:e> (1.3%) were detected during the follow-up period; Furthermore, three patients complained minor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">incontinence</z:e> that was successfully treated by biofeedback and permacol injection into the internal anal sphincter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This prospective audit demonstrates an high proportion of complex anal fistulae treated by seton placement that was the most common surgical technique adopted to treat our patients as a first line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, a good outcome was achieved in the majority of patients with a limited rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015732" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">faecal incontinence</z:e> (6/247 = 2.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>New technologies provide promising alternatives to traditional methods of management particularly in case of complex <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There is, however, a real need for high-quality randomized control trials to evaluate the different surgical and non surgical treatment options </plain></SENT>
