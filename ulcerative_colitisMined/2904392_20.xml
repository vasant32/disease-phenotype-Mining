<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To establish whether concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23899">eicosanoids</z:chebi> determined by equilibrium in vivo dialysis of faeces and equilibrium in vivo dialysis of rectum might predict a relapse in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, 23 patients with completely inactive disease, maintained on sulphasalazine, stopped treatment and entered a prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi> were determined by radioimmunoassay on purified faecal and rectal dialysates at entry, at two weeks, and at two, six, and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If the above concentrations exceeded control concentrations (0.5 ng/ml and 1.0 ng/ml in faecal and rectal fluid, respectively) at any study day, the patient was allocated at random to double blind treatment with sulphasalazine 2 g/day, or placebo for six months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A relapse, defined as recurrence of symptoms accompanied by endoscopic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> occurred in none of six and in four of five patients allocated to sulphasalazine and placebo, respectively (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In no case a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rectal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi> concentration was associated with a relapse in the short term, but only two of 12 patients observed passively remained in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In retrospect, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">leukotriene B4</z:chebi> was a less sensitive predictor of relapse than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that raised concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi> in rectal dialysis fluid identify patients with a substantial risk of relapse </plain></SENT>
