<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have shown that neurokinin A (NKA) may be an endogenous neurotransmitter mediating contraction of human sigmoid colonic circular muscle (HSCCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To elucidate factors responsible for UC motor dysfunction, we examined the role of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>) in the decrease of NKA-induced response of HSCCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As previously demonstrated, NKA-induced contraction or Ca(2+) increase of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> muscle cells is mediated by release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores, because it was not affected by incubation in Ca(2+)-free medium (CFM) containing 200 microM BAPTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In UC, however, CFM reduced both cell contraction and NKA-induced Ca(2+) increase, suggesting reduced Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Ca(2+) medium, NKA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> caused <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Ca(2+) signal in UC cells but reduced cell shortening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The decreased Ca(2+) signal and contraction in response to NKA or thapsigargin were partly recovered in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> scavenger catalase, suggesting involvement of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> in UC-induced dysmotility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> levels were higher in UC than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> HSCCM, and enzymatically isolated UC muscle cells contained much higher levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells, which were significantly reduced by catalase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> treatment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells in CFM reproduced the reduction of NKA-induced Ca(2+) release observed in UC cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> caused a measurable, direct release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> may contribute to reduction of NKA-induced Ca(2+) release from intracellular Ca(2+) stores in UC and contribute to the observed colonic motor dysfunction </plain></SENT>
