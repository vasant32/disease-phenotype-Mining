<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The phospholipase A2 activity was significantly raised in those sera of the patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and those with moderate and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The major phospholipase A2 activity derived from the sera was separated into two peaks by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The phospholipase A2 active fractions were immunochemically characterised using specific antibody directed against human group II phospholipase A2 purified from rheumatoid synovial fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that raised serum phospholipase A2 activity in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> was mainly attributed to the two forms of phospholipase A2 immunochemically related to group II enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, serum phospholipase A2 activity decreased in parallel with clinical improvement, and correlated with serum C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that serum phospholipase A2 activity may serve as an additional indicator of disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum phospholipase A2 activity in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> tends to increase in relation with endoscopic severity, and may be a more sensitive laboratory index than serum C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate to evaluate disease activity </plain></SENT>
