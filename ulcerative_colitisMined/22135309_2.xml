<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Compromised epithelial barrier function and tight junction alterations are hallmarks of a number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disorders</z:e>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased levels of IL-18 have been observed in mucosal samples from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, several reports have demonstrated that immunological or genetic blockage of IL-18 ameliorates the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in multiple in vivo models of IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the effects of IL-18 on intestinal epithelial barrier function remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that IL-18 could disrupt intestinal epithelial barrier structure and function, thus contributing to tissue damage in the context of IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aims of the present study were to determine the effects of IL-18 on epithelial barrier structure and function and to characterize the mechanisms involved in these modulatory properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Human colonic epithelial Caco-2 monolayers were coincubated with IL-18 for 24 h and processed for immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting, quantitative PCR, and permeability measurements (transepithelial resistance, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> fluxes, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> translocation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that IL-18 selectively disrupts tight junctional occludin, without affecting the distribution pattern of claudin-4, claudin-5, zonula occludens-1, or E-cadherin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This effect coincided with a significant increase in myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) protein levels and activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological inhibition of MLCK and NF-ÎºB prevented IL-18-induced loss of occludin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although too subtle to alter paracellular permeability, these fine changes correlated with an MLCK-dependent increase in neutrophil transepithelial migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data suggest that IL-18 may potentiate <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the context of IBD by facilitating neutrophil transepithelial migration via MLCK-dependent disruption of tight junctional occludin </plain></SENT>
