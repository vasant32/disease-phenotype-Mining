<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its gene (16q22) harbours a common polymorphism with two different alleles: Hp1 and Hp2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genotype Hp22 has been shown to be over-represented in different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) are contradictory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine whether Hp plays a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, both genetically and functionally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 1061 patients with CD, 755 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and 152 with primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp>, as well as 452 healthy controls, were genotyped using touch-down PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To confirm association results, 464 CD trios and 151 UC trios were genotyped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum Hp concentrations were determined in 62 individuals of different genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>Colitis</z:hpo> was induced in mice with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34674">dextran sulphate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (DSS) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53076">oxazolone</z:chebi> (Oxa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cytokine production was evaluated by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> quantification in colonic tissue and ELISA on supernatants of mesenteric lymph node cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prevalence of Hp2 was higher in CD and UC than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the confirmatory cohorts, Hp2 was over-transmitted to the affected offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Serum Hp concentrations were higher in individuals with genotypes Hp11 and Hp21 than in those with Hp22 (1.38 vs 0.89 g/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>DSS- and Oxa-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> were more severe in Hp-deficient mice than in control mice and accompanied by higher concentrations (although not statistically significantly different) of tissue <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-17 production was significantly higher in the presence of Hp-deficient serum compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Hp gene may play a role in susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Its implication in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune diseases</z:e> underscores the common pathways between these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Experimental models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> showed that Hp has a protective role in inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, most likely by inhibiting the production of Th1 and Th17 cytokines </plain></SENT>
