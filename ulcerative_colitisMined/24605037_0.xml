<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To describe the relationship between <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> levels and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) characteristics in northeastern Romanian patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a prospective study of 47 consecutive IBD patients admitted to The Institute of Gastroenterology and Hepatology in Iasi, Romania between March 2011 and June 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of IBD was established based on endoscopic, histologic and radiologic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic data, disease characteristics, ongoing treatments and biological parameters of patients (including markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>: C-reactive protein level, fibrinogen level, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> levels were measured and compared with age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers from the same geographic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">Vitamin D</z:chebi> levels were defined as sufficient (&gt; 30 ng/mL), insufficient (20-30 ng/mL), or severely deficient (&lt; 20 ng/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-three of the IBD patients included in this study had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and 14 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 24% of the UC patients and 21% of the CD patients had sufficient <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> levels were significantly lower in the CD patients with moderate to severe disease activity compared to the CD patients in remission or with mild disease activity (16 ± 6 ng/mL vs 26 ± 7 ng/mL; 16 ± 6 ng/mL vs 31 ± 9 ng/mL, respectively, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">Vitamin D</z:chebi> levels in the UC patients were not influenced by disease activity and no correlation was observed with the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> markers tested (C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No association was observed between <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> levels and smoking status or ongoing medication (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5ASA</z:chebi>, steroids, and anti-TNFα) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Newly diagnosed IBD patients had lower <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> levels than patients with established cases, though these differences were not significant (UC: 22 ± 9 ng/mL vs 26 ± 12 ng/mL; CD: 18 ± 6 ng/mL vs 27 ± 11 ng/mL, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although no association was found between the season during which the visit was scheduled and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> levels, the UC patients assessed during the winter tended to have lower levels than those assessed during the summer (22 ± 9 ng/mL vs 28 ± 13 ng/mL, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">Vitamin D</z:chebi> levels are significantly reduced in IBD patients in northeastern Romania, with the lowest levels occurring in CD patients with moderate to severe disease activity </plain></SENT>
