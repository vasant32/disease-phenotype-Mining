<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS AND METHODS: The authors conducted a multicentre observational cohort study to evaluate symptoms associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> H1N1 adjuvanted (Pandemrix, Focetria, FluvalP) and non-adjuvanted (Celvapan) vaccines and to assess the risk of flare of IBD after vaccination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with stable IBD treated with immunomodulators and/or biological therapy were recruited from November 2009 until March 2010 in 12 European countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Harvey-Bradshaw Index and Partial Mayo Score were used to assess disease activity before and 4 weeks after vaccination in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vaccination-related events up to 7 days after vaccination were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 575 patients enrolled (407 CD, 159 UC and nine indeterminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>; 53.9% female; mean age 40.3 years, SD 13.9), local and systemic symptoms were reported by 34.6% and 15.5% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common local and systemic reactions were pain in 32.8% and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> in 6.1% of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Local symptoms were more common with adjuvanted (39.3%) than non-adjuvanted (3.9%) vaccines (p &lt; 0.0001), whereas rates of systemic symptoms were similar with both types (15.0% vs 18.4%, p = 0.44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the adjuvanted group, Pandemrix more often induced local reactions than FluvalP and Focetria (51.2% vs 27.6% and 15.4%, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Solicited adverse events were not associated with any patient characteristics, specific immunomodulatory treatment, or biological therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four weeks after vaccination, absence of flare was observed in 377 patients with CD (96.7%) and 151 with UC (95.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">Influenza</z:e> A (H1N1)v vaccines are well tolerated in patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Non-adjuvanted vaccines are associated with fewer local reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The risk of IBD flare is probably not increased after H1N1 vaccination </plain></SENT>
