<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CARD15/NOD2, a member of the Ced4 superfamily which includes Apaf-1 and CARD4/NOD1, has recently been associated with genetic predisposition to CD but additional genetic factors remain to be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because CARD4/NOD1 shares many structural and functional similarities with CARD15, we tested its putative role in IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The 11 exons of CARD4 were screened for the presence of variants in 63 unrelated IBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The only non-private genetic variation encoding for a substitution in the peptidic chain was genotyped in 381 IBD families (235 CD, 58 UC, 81 mixed, and seven indeterminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> families) using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genotyping data were analysed by the transmission disequilibrium test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five of nine sequence variations identified in the coding sequence of the gene encoded for non-conservative changes (E266K, D372N, R705Q, T787M, and T787K) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four were present in only one family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remaining variant (E266K), which exhibited an allele frequency of 0.28, was not associated with CD, UC, or IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, IBD patients carrying sequence variations in their CARD4 gene had a similar phenotype to those with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that CARD4 does not play a major role in genetic susceptibility to IBD </plain></SENT>
