<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tissue damage was localised to the colon by the Auer technique of inducing local non-specific <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, by the rectal instillation of dilute formalin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Formalin alone gave transient changes that reverted to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> within 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In rabbits given intravenous immune complexes formed in antigen-excess, a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> was initiated, with histological features including mucosal ulceration, mixed inflammatory cell infiltration in the lamina propria, and crypt <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is possible that immune-complex damage may be one of the pathogenic mechanisms involved in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
