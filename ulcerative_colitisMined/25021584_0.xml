<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">Azathioprine</z:chebi> (AZA) is an established treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, controversy exists regarding its efficacy in inducing and maintaining clinical remission, particularly with the advent of biologics which, unlike AZA, have been tested in large, rigorously designed randomised controlled trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the effectiveness of AZA as second-line therapy after failure of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="20551">5-aminosalicylates</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASAs</z:chebi>) in a large cohort of UC patients, with particular emphasis on whether its earlier use alters the natural history of the disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> UC patients treated with AZA at our centre were identified from a prospective electronic database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We excluded individuals who had received either infliximab or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">ciclosporin</z:chebi> as a bridge to AZA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The following demographic data were collected: gender, age at diagnosis, age at AZA commencement, concomitant therapy at AZA commencement, and duration of disease prior to AZA commencement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We assessed response to therapy at 4 months and remission at last point of follow-up, using physicians' global assessment, need for hospitalisation, escalation of therapy to a biologic, or colectomy, and serious adverse events (including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We examined whether earlier AZA use (within 12 months of diagnosis) reduced need for hospitalisation, biologic therapy, or colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 255 patients were included (55% male, mean age at diagnosis 36.4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean age at commencing AZA was 42.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean disease duration prior to AZA commencement was 70 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Concomitant therapy at AZA commencement was oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASAs</z:chebi> in 87%, topical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASAs</z:chebi> in 22%, and oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> in 77% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At 4 months, 207 (81%) of 255 patients were still on AZA (46 had discontinued due to adverse events and 2 due to non-response), and 163 (64%) had responded to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were 165 (65%) patients still receiving AZA at last point of follow-up, of whom 153 (60%) were in remission (mean duration of therapy 64.5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>26 patients required admission to hospital for an exacerbation during AZA treatment, 20 patients ultimately required biologic therapy, and 21 underwent colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Among 90 patients receiving AZA within 12 months of diagnosis, 21 (23%) patients experienced one of these three endpoints, compared with 29 (19%) of 154 who commenced AZA &gt;12 months after diagnosis (p = 0.40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Serious adverse events included 6 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo>, 6 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (3 non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007114" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">skin cancers</z:e>) and 1 case of neutropenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> presenting within 1 month of AZA commencement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: AZA is a safe and effective therapy for UC patients who fail <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASAs</z:chebi>, and should continue to be used prior to instituting biologic therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, earlier use does not seem to alter the natural history of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>DISCLOSURE OF INTEREST: None Declared </plain></SENT>
