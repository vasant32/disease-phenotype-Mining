<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 56 UC patients (34 males and 22 females, aged 43.5 years, range 21-66 years), including 36 at active stage and 20 at remission stage, and 25 sex-and age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The level of abeta2GPI was measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The platelet activation markers, platelet activation complex-I (PAC-I) and P-selectin (CD62P) were detected by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The A value for IgG abeta2GPI in the active UC group was 0.61 +/- 0.13, significantly higher than that in the remittent UC and control groups (0.50 +/- 0.13 and 0.22 +/- 0.14, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference between the two groups (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The A value for IgM abeta2GPI in the active and remittent UC groups was 0.43 +/- 0.13 and 0.38 +/- 0.12, significantly higher than that in the control group (0.20 +/- 0.12, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant difference between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The PAC-I positive rate for the active and remittent UC groups was 30.6% +/- 7.6% and 19.6% +/- 7.8% respectively, significantly higher than that for the control group (6.3% +/- 1.7%, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference between the two groups (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The CD62P positive rate for the active and remittent UC groups was 45.0% +/- 8.8% and 31.9% +/- 7.8% respectively, significantly higher than that for the control group (9.2% +/- 2.7%, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference between the two groups (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the active UC group, the more severe the state of illness was, the higher the A value for IgG abeta2GPI was, and the positive rate for PAC-I and CD62P was positively correlated with the state of illness (Fabeta2GPI = 3.679, P &lt; 0.05; FPAC-I (%) = 5.346, P &lt; 0.01; and FCD62P (%) = 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>418, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, in the same state of illness, the A value for IgG abeta2GPI was positively correlated to the positive rates for PAC-I and CD62P </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: abeta2GPI level, platelet activation state and their relationship of them are closely correlated with the pathogenesis and development of UC </plain></SENT>
