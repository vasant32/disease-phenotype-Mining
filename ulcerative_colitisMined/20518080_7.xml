<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical predictors have probably been the most broadly studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), age at diagnosis, disease location and smoking habit are currently the strongest predictors of disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A younger age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> is associated with more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive disease</z:e> both in CD and UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disease location in CD is associated with different types of complications: surgery and recurrence in upper gastrointestinal and proximal small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel disease</z:e>; and surgery in distal small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel disease</z:e> and peri-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anal lesions</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rectal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In UC, extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> is clearly been associated with more severe disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, active smoking globally increases disease severity in CD but decreases it in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Besides these important factors, others may predispose to some specific disease evolution and complications, and are also reviewed in the present paper </plain></SENT>
