<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Expression of alpha 4 beta 7 on memory T lymphocytes identifies a cell population that preferentially migrates to the gut </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Detection of alpha 4 beta 7 on circulating lymphocytes may permit the identification of specific subsets trafficking between the circulation and the gut in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Samples and clinical details were taken from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012813" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticulitis</z:e>/ infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral blood and lamina propria mononuclear cells were isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cells were labelled with CD3, CD4, CD25, CD45RO or alpha 4 beta 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median levels of circulating total memory T cells (CD4+CD45RO+) were increased in CD (p &lt; 0.01) and UC (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the proportion of systemic gut homing T cells (CD4+CD45RO+ alpha 4 beta 7+) was decreased in CD (p &lt; 0.05), UC (p &lt; 0.002), and inflammatory controls (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Levels of activated gut homing T cells (CD4+CD25+ alpha 4 beta 7+) were increased in CD (p &lt; 0.01) and UC (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For both CD4+CD45RO+ and CD4+CD25+ cells, the proportion of lymphocytes coexpressing alpha 4 beta 7 was decreased compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In small and large intestine lamina propria, expression of alpha 4 beta 7+ on CD3+ cells was extensive, although it was decreased in CD (p &lt; 0.03), UC (p &lt; 0.05), and inflammatory controls (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Circulating and mucosal gut homing lymphocyte populations are changed in patients with colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This may arise due to a dilution effect from recruited naive T cells, or from integrin down regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Changes in general CD4+ lymphocyte populations mask more subtle variations in those cells with gut homing potential </plain></SENT>
