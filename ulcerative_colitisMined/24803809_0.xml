<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a single center (Lenox Hill Hospital) retrospective cohort and descriptive study of extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) for 20 years or more with a minimum of 3 surveillance colonoscopies and biopsies performed after the first 10 years of UC diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data analyzed included: duration of UC, date of diagnosis of (CC) or (HGD), number of surveillance colonoscopies, and biopsies showing histological <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and its severity in each of 6 segments when endoscopic appearance is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two subgroups of patients were compared: group 1 patients who developed CC/HGD and group 2 patients who did not develop CC/HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 115 patients with longstanding UC reviewed, 68 patients met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients were in group 1 and 48 in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We identified the number of times for each patient when the endoscopic appearance was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> but biopsies nevertheless showed <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, histological disease activity in the absence of gross/endoscopic disease was found in 31.2% (95%CI: 28%-35%) of colonoscopies performed on the entire cohort of 68 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histological disease activity when the colonoscopy showed an absence of gross disease activity was more common in group 1 than group 2 patients, 88% (95%CI: 72%-97%) vs 59% (95%CI: 53%-64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 3/20 (15%) of patients in group 1 ever had a colonoscopy completely without demonstrated disease activity (i.e., no endoscopic or histological activity) as compared to 37/48 (77%) of patients in group 2, and only 3.3% (95%CI: 0.09%-8.3%) of colonoscopies in group 1 had no histological <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> compared to 23% (95%CI: 20%-27%) in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Progression to HGD or CC in extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> of long standing was more frequently encountered among those patients who demonstrate persistent histological <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the absence of gross <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mucosal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings support including the elimination of histological <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the definition of mucosal healing, and support this endpoint as an appropriate goal of therapy because of its risk of increasing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
