<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients suffering from mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, with disease activity index (DAI) between 3 and 10 and under stable therapy with oral aminosalicylates, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50667">mercaptopurine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>, for at least 8 wk prior to baseline assessments, were considered suitable for enrollment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients were enrolled to assume PLC 2 g/d (two active tablets twice daily) orally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical-endoscopic and histological activity were assessed by DAI and histological index (HI), respectively, following a colonoscopy performed immediately before and after 4 wk treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical response was defined as a lowering of at least 3 points in DAI and clinical remission as a DAI score â‰¤ 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological response was defined as an improvement of HI of at least 1 point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We used median values for the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differences pre- and post-treatment were analyzed by Wilcoxon signed rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients enrolled completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient, despite medical advice, took deflazacort 5 d before follow-up colonoscopy examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No side effects were reported by patients during the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After treatment, 71% (SE 12%) of patients achieved clinical response, while 64% (SE 13%) obtained remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Separating UC from CD patients, we observed a clinical response in 60% (SE 16%) and 100%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore 60% (SE 16%) of UC patients and 75% (SE 25%) of CD patients were in clinical remission after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The median DAI was 7 [interquartile range (IQR): 4-8] before treatment and decreased to 2 (IQR: 1-3) (P &lt; 0.01) after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Only patients with UC showed a significant reduction of DAI, from a median 6.5 (IQR: 4-9) before treatment to 2 (IQR: 1-3) after treatment (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Conversely, in CD patients, although displaying a clear reduction of DAI from 7 (IQR: 5.5-7.5) before therapy to 1.5 (IQR: 0.5-2.5) after therapy, differences observed were not significant (P = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Seventy-nine percent (SE 11%) of patients showed improvement of HI of at least 1 point, while only one CD and two UC patients showed HI stability; none showed HI worsening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Median HI decreased from 1 (IQR: 1-2), to 0.5 (IQR: 0-1) at the endoscopic control in the whole population (P &lt; 0.01), while it changed from 1 (IQR: 1-2) to 0.5 (IQR: 0-1) in UC patients (P &lt; 0.01) and from 1.5 (IQR: 1-2) to 0.5 (IQR: 0-1) in CD patients (P = not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The two sample tests of proportions showed no significant differences in clinical and histological response or in clinical remission between UC and CD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>No side effects were reported during treatment or at 4 wk follow-up visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PLC improves endoscopic and histological activity of mild to moderate UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to evaluate PLC efficacy in colonic CD patients </plain></SENT>
