<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many studies have investigated this risk and reported widely varying rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A literature search using Medline with the explosion of references identified 194 studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 116 met our inclusion criteria from which the number of patients and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> detected could be extracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall pooled estimates, with 95% confidence intervals (CI), of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> prevalence and incidence were obtained using a random effects model on either the log odds or log incidence scale, as appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in any UC patient, based on 116 studies, was estimated to be 3.7% (95% CI 3.2-4.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 116 studies, 41 reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From these the overall incidence rate was 3/1000 person years duration (pyd), (95% CI 2/1000 to 4/1000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence rate for any child was 6/1000 pyd (95% CI 3/1000 to 13/1000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 41 studies, 19 reported results stratified into 10 year intervals of disease duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For the first 10 years the incidence rate was 2/1000 pyd (95% CI 1/1000 to 2/1000), for the second decade the incidence rate was estimated to be 7/1000 pyd (95% CI 4/1000 to 12/1000), and in the third decade the incidence rate was 12/1000 pyd (95% CI 7/1000 to 19/1000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These incidence rates corresponded to cumulative probabilities of 2% by 10 years, 8% by 20 years, and 18% by 30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The worldwide <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence rates varied geographically, being 5/1000 pyd in the USA, 4/1000 pyd in the UK, and 2/1000 pyd in Scandinavia and other countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Over time the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk has increased since 1955 but this finding was not significant (p=0.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Using new meta-analysis techniques we determined the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in UC by decade of disease and defined the risk in pancolitics and children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We found a non-significant increase in risk over time and estimated how risk varies with geography </plain></SENT>
