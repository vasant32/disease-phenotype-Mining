<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A foam enema preparation has been developed and its efficacy investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> foam enemas compared with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> foam enemas in the treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients aged over 18 years presenting with a relapse of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> were randomly allocated treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> foam enema (n = 149 evaluable patients) and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> foam enema (n = 146 evaluable patients) for four weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A randomised multicentre investigator blind parallel group trial was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was found that after four weeks of treatment, clinical remission was achieved by 52% of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> treated patients and 31% of patients treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a trend in favour of more patients in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> group achieving sigmoidoscopic remission (40% v 31%, p = 0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histological remission was achieved by 27% and 21% of patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Symptoms improved in both treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significantly more <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> patients had no blood in their stools after four weeks of treatment (67% v 40%, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">Prednisolone</z:chebi> treated patients had significantly fewer days with liquid stools than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> patients, with a median of 0 and 1 days respectively by week 4 (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this study <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> foam enema was superior to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> foam enema with regards to clinical remission, this was supported by favourable trends in sigmoidoscopic and histological remission rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Both treatments were well tolerated </plain></SENT>
