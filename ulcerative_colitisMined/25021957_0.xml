<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Prescription of a-TNF therapy in UC in the UK is limited to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> by NICE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increasingly physicians are under pressure from patients to offer an alternative to the traditional limited therapeutic options and this has resulted in the drug being used in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> setting, as it is in other countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients receiving a-TNF for UC up until December 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-one patients have received a-TNF therapy for UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five are currently on a-TNF treatment, 4 of whom commenced in the last 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve were discontinued for non-response, 1 for funding, 1 for remission, 2 for side effects and 1 at the patient's request </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two were switched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Response to the agents are shown in Table 1. gutjnl;63/Suppl_1/A77-a/T1T1T1 Abstract PTU-086 Table 1 Remission Clinical Radiological Histological Biochemical Yes 4 0 0 7 No 16 1 6 13 Not assessed 0 19 14 0 Incomplete 1 1 1 1 Total 21 21 21 21 Thirteen received infliximab as first agent, eight had adalimumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven were on other immunomodulators at the time of commencing a-TNF and 11 were intolerant to immunomodulators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three had a-TNF for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100282'>acute colitis</z:hpo>, 15 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and data unknown for 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Currently 3 patients are in clinical remission, 11 had surgery and 7 have active disease (with 2 strongly recommended to have surgery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients had steroids while on a-TNF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mean time on a-TNF was 4.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: a-TNF use in UC does not appear to be very effective in this context, with 62% having or requiring surgery and 60% requiring concurrent steroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>To make this therapy more cost effective in this patient group more work is needed to identify patients likely to be responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>DISCLOSURE OF INTEREST: None Declared </plain></SENT>
