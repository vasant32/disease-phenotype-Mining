<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The natural history of low- grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) found during colonoscopic surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The optimum strategy, either continued surveillance or immediate colectomy, is debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rate of progression of LGD to more advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> has been reported to be as low as 0% after 10 years and as high as 53% after a mean follow-up of 5 years.(1,2) METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases of LGD detected at colonoscopy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> performed between May 1995 and May 2010 were identified, retrospectively, from the pathology database at a single tertiary centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy records and case notes were reviewed and the outcomes for patients undergoing either immediate colectomy or further surveillance endoscopy were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 22 patients with LGD were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>9 patients had endoscopically resectable <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> - like lesions, and were excluded from further analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>13 patients were identified as having unifocal, flat, LGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median age was 68 (range 44-87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median time from diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> was 14 years (range 1 to 29 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>'s throughout the time period sampled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>8 patients elected to have an immediate colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>5 of 8 resection specimens were negative of LGD, with features of the underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative Colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Unifocal LGD was identified in 3 of 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (HGD or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>) was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>4 patients continued surveillance with a median follow-up of 6.5 years (range 5-9) and a median number of colonoscopies of 5 (range 3-7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>LGD was identified on further colonoscopy in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This patient then opted for colectomy, but no LGD was identified in the resected specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>3 patients had further LGD identified during surveillance endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients had LGD identified at colonoscopies performed outside their scheduled surveillance interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>To date those undergoing surveillance have had no subsequent LGD, HGD or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The finding of LGD in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> is associated with a low risk of synchronous or subsequent advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Continued surveillance may be a reasonable option in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
