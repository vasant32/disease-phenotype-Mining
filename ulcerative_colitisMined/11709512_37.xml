<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Balsalazide is a new <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>) containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50266">prodrug</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its efficacy in comparison with standard <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> therapy and the optimum dose for maintaining remission of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> are still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To compare the relapse preventing effect and safety profile of two doses of balsalazide and a standard dose of Eudragit coated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 133 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in remission were recruited to participate in a double blind, multicentre, randomised trial: 49 patients received balsalazide 1.5 g twice daily, 40 received balsalazide 3.0 g twice daily, and 44 received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> 0.5 g three times daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Efficacy assessments were clinical activity index (CAI) and endoscopic score according to Rachmilewitz, and a histological score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, laboratory tests were performed and urinary excretion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> and its metabolite N-Ac-5-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study lasted for 26 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Balsalazide 3.0 g twice daily resulted in a significantly higher clinical remission rate (77.5%) than balsalazide 1.5 g twice daily (43.8%) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> 0.5 g three times daily (56.8%) (p=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The respective times to relapse were 161 days, 131 days (p=0.003), and 144 days (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, pairwise contrasts of the final endoscopic score demonstrated a significant difference (p=0.005) between the two balsalazide treatment groups while differences between either of these two groups and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with balsalazide excreted less <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> and N-Ac-5-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> than patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> but these differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Discontinuation of the trial because of adverse effects occurred in nine patients: three in the balsalazide 1.5 g twice daily group, two in the balsalazide 3.0 g twice daily group, and four in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> 0.5 g three times daily group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No clinically important new drug safety related findings were identified in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High dose balsalazide (3.0 g twice daily) was superior in maintaining remission in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> compared with a low dose (1.5 g twice daily) or a standard dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> (0.5 g three times daily) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three treatments were safe and well tolerated </plain></SENT>
