<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To develop a novel model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in rats, using a combination of iodoacetamide and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), and to elucidate the pathophysiologic processes implicated in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 158) were inoculated intrarectally on a weekly basis with 4 different combinations: (a) 1% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> (MC), (b) 100 microL of 6% iodoacetamide (IA) in 1% MC, (c) 200 microL containing 4 x 10(8) colony factor units (CFU) of EPEC, and (d) combined treatment of (IA) followed by bacteria (B) after 2 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty days post treatment, each of the four groups was divided into two subgroups; the inoculation was stopped for one subgroup and the other subgroup continued with biweekly inoculation until the end of the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>Colitis</z:hpo> was evaluated by the clinical course of the disease, the macroscopic and microscopic alterations, activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO), and by TNF-alpha gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Findings indicative of UC were seen in the combined treatment (IA + B) as well as the IA continued treatment groups: the animals showed slow rate of increase in body weight, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, bloody stools, high colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> score, as well as histological alterations characteristic of UC, with an extensive inflammatory reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the course of the experiment, the MPO activity was consistently elevated and the TNF-alpha gene expression was upregulated compared to the control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> model used in the present study resembles, to a great extent, the human disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is reproducible with characteristics indicative of chronicity </plain></SENT>
