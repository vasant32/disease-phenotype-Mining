<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty three patients with total <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (mean disease duration of 22 years) were regularly colonoscoped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biopsies of colonic mucosa were analysed by flow cytometric technique and were also assessed histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Findings of abnormal DNA pattern (<z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>) were compared with findings of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients (9%) had <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>, four of those at repeated colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four of those patients also had various degrees of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one patient <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> preceded the finding of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and in another <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> preceded a well differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, grade Dukes' A subsequently found at surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four additional patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in connection with macroscopic lesions, but were diploid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that flow cytometric DNA analysis in long standing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> may be helpful in addition to histopathology in the detection of potential <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
