<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reported 5 patients with positive serum proteinase-3 antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (PR3-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi>) and tried to (1) identify the common clinical features of these patients; (2) investigate the efficacy of a novel therapy using a Chinese medicine compound; and (3) attract more gastroenterologists to be engaged in further study of this subset of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The common manifestations of disease in these 5 patients included recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>bloody diarrhea</z:hpo> and inflammatory lesions involving the entire colorectal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initial treatment with intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> successfully induced remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four of these 5 patients were steroid-dependence, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi>, such as <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, were ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients, only the particular Chinese medicine compound could induce and maintain remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient underwent colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No vascular inflammatory lesions were found by histopathological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although more cases are needed for confirmation, our study indicates that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> with positive PR3-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> may belong to a subtype of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The particular Chinese medicine compound used in our study is by far the most effective in the management of these patients, with additional advantages of having no noticeable side-effects and less financial burden </plain></SENT>
