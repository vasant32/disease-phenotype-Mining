<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: This study aimed at identifying cells in intestinal and mesenteric tissue samples that might express group II phospholipase A2 (PLA2-II) at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and enzyme protein levels in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND TISSUE SAMPLES: Tissue samples were obtained from the intestine, mesentery, skeletal muscle, and subcutaneous fat of six patients who underwent panproctocolectomy for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mucosal biopsy specimens were obtained from the colon of another group of six patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> during routine diagnostic colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissues from six patients without intestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Tissue samples were studied by light microscopy, immunohistochemistry for PLA2-II enzyme protein, and in situ hybridisation and northern hybridisation for PLA2-II <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PLA2-II <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and PLA2-II protein were detected in metaplastic Paneth cells in six patients and in the columnar epithelial cells of colonic mucosa in four out of six patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Positive findings were less numerous in patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only two out of six control patients had a weak positive signal for PLA2-II <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and one of these two patients had a weak positive immunoreaction for PLA2-II in columnar epithelial cells in the colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the control patients had metaplastic Paneth cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Metaplastic Paneth cells and colonic epithelial cells synthesise PLA2-II in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The activity of the PLA2-II synthesis seems to be related to the degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the diseased bowel </plain></SENT>
