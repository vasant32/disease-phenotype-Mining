<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLE and related technologies are often termed "virtual biopsy" as they simulate the images seen in traditional histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, the use of CLE was reported in the study of colonic mucosa in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> and in particular in patients affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLE has the potential to have an important role in management of IBD patients as it can be used to assess the grading of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and in detection of microscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in endoscopically silent segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, CLE can be used in surveillance programs especially in high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This report aims to evaluate the current data on the application of confocal endomicroscopy in clinical gastroenterology and particularly in the study of colonic mucosa in UC patients </plain></SENT>
