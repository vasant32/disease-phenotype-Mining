<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sera from 30 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) (16 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and 14 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) were assayed for the presence of antibodies against 159 Escherichia coli O-antigens and compared with sera from 16 matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients with IBD had agglutinating antibodies to a higher number of Escherichia coli O-antigens and in higher titres than the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number of positive agglutinins was O-33 mean 13.8 in CD, O-26 mean 7.9 for UC, and O-7 mean 1.5 in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight patients with IBD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003040'>arthropathy</z:hpo> had antibodies to fewer O-antigens (O-7 mean 3.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The antibodies were in the IgG and IgM, in titres corresponding to original values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No specific O-serotypes were associated with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Common serotypes, R-plasmid carrying serotypes, and those associated with shigella-like adult diarrhoea were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>O14 was detected only in five patients and O119 in none </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the number of Escherichia coli agglutinins and the site and severity of the disease or type of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the presence of the high numbers of Escherichia coli antibodies is secondary to the disease process and is unlikely to be causally involved in the pathogenesis of the disease, but may play a role in the perpetuation of the disease and in the extraintestinal complications </plain></SENT>
