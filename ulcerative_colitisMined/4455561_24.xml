<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This paper reports the indications for, and results of, excision of the large intestine with ileostomy in 73 patients with Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> who have been followed for a mean of nine years since resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-four of them are still alive and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but two of the survivors are now in good health.However, 23 (33%) have developed recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> since resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is higher than that reported in many other series and may be due to differences in the length of follow up, the site and extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">colonic disease</z:e>, the age of the patient at the time of excision with ileostomy, and differences in the pathological interpretation of the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The high recurrence rate in this series lends caution to the view that the prognosis after excisional surgery and ileostomy for Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> is as good as after the same operation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and should influence the decision when the alternative of medical or surgical management are being considered for patients with Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
