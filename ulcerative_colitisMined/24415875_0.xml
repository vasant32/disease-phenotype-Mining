<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>-5 locus (IBD5) and interleukin-23 receptor (IL23R) gene variants in UC patients and test for gene-gene interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population (n = 625) was comprised of 320 unrelated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) patients with Caucasian origin and 316 age- and gender-matched, healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five variants in the IBD5 locus (IGR2198a_1 rs11739135, IGR2096a_1 rs12521868, IGR2230a_1 rs17622208, SLC22A4 rs1050152 and SLC22A5 rs2631367) and two of the IL23R gene (rs1004819, rs2201841) were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism methods were used for genotyping, the SLC22A4 rs1050152 genotypes were determined by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interactions and specific genotype combinations of the seven variants were tested by binary logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IL23R genotypes were stratified by IBD5 genotypes for further interaction analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For the IL23R rs1004819 A allele we found significantly higher allele frequency (P = 0.032) in UC patients compared to control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The SNP rs1004819 showed significant association with UC risk for carriers (P = 0.004, OR = 1.606; 95%CI: 1.160-2.223) and the SNP rs2201841 for homozygotes (P = 0.030, OR = 1.983; 95%CI: 1.069-3.678) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Individually none of the IBD5 markers conferred risk to UC development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence for statistical interaction either between IBD5 loci and IL23R genes using logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After genotype stratification, we could detect a positive association on the background of rs1004819 A allele for SLC22A4 T, SLC22A5 C, IGR2198a_1 C or IGR2096a_1 T allele, the highest OR was calculated in the presence of SLC22A4 T allele (P = 0.005, OR = 2.015; 95%CI: 1.230-3.300) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no association with UC for any combinations of rs1004819 and IGR2230a_1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The IL23R rs2201841 homozygous genotype and IBD5 carrier status together did not confer susceptibility for UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study has shown that UC susceptibility genes are likely to act in a complex interactive manner similar to CD </plain></SENT>
