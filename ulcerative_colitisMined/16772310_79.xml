<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> in women has been reported after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> but reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> rates vary substantially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: (1) To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> post-IPAA compared with medical management; (2) to estimate the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> post-IPAA; and (3) to identify modifiable risk factors which contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medline, EMBASE, Current Contents, meeting abstracts, and bibliographies were searched independently by two investigators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The titles and abstracts of 189 potentially relevant studies were reviewed; eight met the criteria and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> data were extracted independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consensus was achieved on each data point, and fixed effects meta-analyses, a funnel plot, and sensitivity analyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The initial meta-analysis of eight studies had significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> (p = 0.004) due to one study with very high preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> (38%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When this study was omitted, the relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> after IPAA was 3.17 (2.41-4.18), with non-significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The weighted average <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> rate in medically treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> was 15% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven studies, and the weighted average <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> rate was 48% after IPAA (50% if <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight studies are included) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We were unable to identify any procedural factors that consistently affected the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IPAA increases the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> in women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> by approximately threefold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>Infertility</z:hpo>, defined as achieving pregnancy in 12 months of attempting conception, increased from 15% to 48% in women post-IPAA for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This provides a basis for counselling patients considering colectomy with IPAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further studies of modifiable risk factors are needed </plain></SENT>
