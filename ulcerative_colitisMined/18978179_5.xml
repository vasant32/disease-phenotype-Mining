<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) comprises primarily the two disorders - <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> - that involve deregulated T cell responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ever-increasing incidence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> during recent decades, combined with the limited efficacy and potential adverse effects of current treatments, explain the real need for seeking more specific and selective methods for treating these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the ability of interleukin 2 (IL2)-caspase 3 chimeric protein, designed to target activated T lymphocytes that express the high-affinity IL2 receptor, to ameliorate the clinical symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> murine experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, using a mouse model of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32149">sodium sulfate</z:chebi> (DSS)-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mice with DSS-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> were treated with IL2-caspase 3 for 7 days and disease severity was assessed in parallel to control, non-treated mice, receiving only daily injections of phosphate-buffered saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IL2-caspase 3 was tested both for its ability to prevent the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, and for its therapeutic potential to cure on-going, active <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, colon tissue samples were used for myeloperoxidase assays and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> isolation followed by polymerase chain reaction to determine <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels of specific genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with IL2-caspase 3 dose-dependently ameliorated the disease activity index (DAI) of mice <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We achieved up to 78% improvement in DAI with intravenous injections of 15 microg/mouse/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, IL2-caspase 3 decreased neutrophil and macrophage infiltration to the inflamed tissue by up to 57% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IL2-caspase 3 was proven as a therapeutic reagent in another model, where treatment begins only after disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrated a 70% decrease in DAI when compared to non-treated sick mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A reduction in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels of both IL1 beta and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha was found in lysates of total colon tissue of treated mice, as compared to sick, untreated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We also found that expression levels of Bcl2 were significantly decreased after treatment, while Bax was upregulated in comparison to non-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the Bcl2/Bax ratio, which is elevated in both experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, decreased dramatically after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IL2-caspase 3 chimeric protein may provide a novel approach to the therapy of human IBD, and a possible suggested treatment for other pathological conditions that involve uncontrolled expansion of activated T cells </plain></SENT>
