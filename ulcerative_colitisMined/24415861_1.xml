<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been a worldwide health-care problem with a continually increasing incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is thought that IBD results from an aberrant and continuing immune response to the microbes in the gut, catalyzed by the genetic susceptibility of the individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the etiology of IBD remains largely unknown, it involves a complex interaction between the genetic, environmental or microbial factors and the immune responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the four components of IBD pathogenesis, most rapid progress has been made in the genetic study of gut <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latest internationally collaborative studies have ascertained 163 susceptibility gene loci for IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The genes implicated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011463'>childhood-onset</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> IBD overlap, suggesting similar genetic predispositions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the fact that genetic factors account for only a portion of overall disease variance indicates that microbial and environmental factors may interact with genetic elements in the pathogenesis of IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, the adaptive immune response has been classically considered to play a major role in the pathogenesis of IBD, as new studies in immunology and genetics have clarified that the innate immune response maintains the same importance in inducing gut <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recent progress in understanding IBD pathogenesis sheds lights on relevant disease mechanisms, including the innate and adaptive immunity, and the interactions between genetic factors and microbial and environmental cues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this review, we provide an update on the major advances that have occurred in above areas </plain></SENT>
