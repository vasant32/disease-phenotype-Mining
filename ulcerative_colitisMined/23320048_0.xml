<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Steroids have been a mainstay of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) therapy for many years, based on a thoroughly established efficacy profile for the induction of remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in light of the considerable side effects and negative perceptions they carry, it is important to ensure such treatments are used as effectively as possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For severe UC, the need for steroids is rarely questioned, and rightly so; it is for moderate UC that the role of steroids should be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both patients and clinicians place a high importance on rapid, effective resolution of symptoms, yet at the same time wish to avoid unnecessary side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Through consideration of the available evidence, it becomes clear that both steroids and high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>) are supported by robust trials demonstrating their efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indeed, both therapies have been shown to give rise to resolution of symptoms after 2 weeks in many patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, a paucity of head-to-head comparisons makes conclusive interpretation challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This paper therefore presents a practical approach, which builds on the available evidence and is developed from informed discussions with patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This approach involves initiating therapy with high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>, followed by a review of symptom improvements after 2-3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Steroids can then be introduced, when needed, with minimal delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this way, symptoms can be resolved rapidly, yet many patients may avoid unpleasant side effects </plain></SENT>
