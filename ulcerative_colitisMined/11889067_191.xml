<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The notes of patients attending the Oxford IBD clinic from 1968 to 1999 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Remission was defined as no need for oral steroids for at least three months and relapse was defined as active disease requiring steroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 622 of 2205 patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> (272 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 346 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and four indeterminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of the initial course of treatment was 634 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall remission rates were 45% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and 58% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the 424 patients who received more than six months of treatment, remission rates were 64% and 87%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Factors favouring remission were <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (p=0.0001), lower white blood cell (WBC) or neutrophil count (p=0.0001), higher mean cell volume (p=0.0001), and older age (p=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">colonic disease</z:e> favoured remission (p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Factors that were not significant were age, sex, lymphocyte count, and dose (mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients remaining in remission at one, three, and five years was 0.95, 0.69, and 0.55, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The chance of remaining in remission was higher if WBC was less than 5 x 10(9) (p=0.03) and in male patients (p=0.01; <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> only) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in relapse rates between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>After stopping <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>, the proportion of patients remaining in remission at one, three, and five years was 0.63, 0.44, and 0.35 (222 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Duration of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> treatment did not affect the relapse rate after stopping treatment (p=0.68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">Azathioprine</z:chebi> is effective treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> is reasonably well sustained over five years </plain></SENT>
