<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective longitudinal survey of patient demographic and clinical characteristics, disease characteristics, diagnostic methods, management and course of disease was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up period was 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of a total of 1100 IBD patients attending the Department of Gastroenterology, 59 (5%) [median age 82 years (range 64-101); 25 male (42%)] were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (n = 37, 61%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (n = 14, 24%), and indeterminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (n = 8, 15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Remission was induced in 40 (68%) patients within a median interval of 6 mo (range 1-21) and immunosuppressive therapy was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histological evaluation based on many biopsy samples and the course of the disease led to other diagnosis, namely SCAD instead of IBD in five (8%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: OAC is not an infrequent problem for the gastroenterologist, and should be considered in the evaluation of older patients with clinical features suggestive of IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Extra awareness and extensive biopsy sampling are required in order to avoid an erroneous diagnosis purely based on histological mimicry of changes seen in SCAD, when diagnosing IBD in the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticulosis</z:e> coli </plain></SENT>
