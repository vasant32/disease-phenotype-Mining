<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We experienced a very rare case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) accompanied with analogous lesions in the stomach, duodenum, and ileal J-pouch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ileal J-pouch anal anastomosis was performed on a 29-year old woman in 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six years later, she was admitted again to our hospital because of epigastralgia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, watery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> and low <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on the results of endoscopic examination, we diagnosed it as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, on hypotonic duodenography, expansion of the duodenal bulb and the descending portion were poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kerckring folds disappeared with typical lead-pipe appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of the gastric and duodenal lesion in this patient was similar to that of the colonic lesions of UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the gastroduodenal lesions in this patient, symptomatic remission was obtained following administration of crushed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> tablets (1500 mg/d) for 14 d with continuous administration of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Firstly we used ciprofloxacin to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the fifth day, she got a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742006" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">catheter infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the catheter culture, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6827">methicillin</z:chebi>-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore we changed ciprofloxacin to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28001">vancomycin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28001">Vancomycin</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28001">Vancomycin</z:chebi> was very effective, and the stool frequency dramatically improved in three days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Now she continues to take <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi>, but her condition is stable and there has been no recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
