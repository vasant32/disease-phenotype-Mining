<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (pANCA) are a well recognised marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to oligomannosidic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ASCA) are a new marker associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To assess the value of detecting pANCA and/or ASCA for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum samples were obtained from 100 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 101 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, 27 patients with other miscellaneous diarrhoeal illnesses, and 163 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Determination of pANCA and ASCA was performed using the standardised indirect immunofluorescence technique and an ELISA, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The combination of a positive pANCA test and a negative ASCA test yielded a sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of 57%, 97%, and 92.5% respectively for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combination of a positive ASCA test and a negative pANCA test yielded a sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of 49%, 97%, and 96% respectively for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among patients with miscellaneous non-inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel disorders</z:e>, three were ASCA positive and two were pANCA positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One control was ASCA positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of ASCA in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> was associated with small bowel involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ASCA and pANCA are strongly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Combination of both tests could help the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
