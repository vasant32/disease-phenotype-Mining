<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Numerous epidemiological studies have been performed to determine factors that might contribute to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the role of oral contraceptive agents in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) have been assessed, most studies were of small sample size and characterised by low statistical precision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis was performed to increase the statistical power and to investigate the association between the use of oral contraceptives and the development of CD and UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study was based on a search of a Medline database from 1975 to October 1993 and a review of reference lists from published articles, reviews, symposia proceedings, and abstracts from major gastrointestinal meetings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> studies specifically designed to evaluate this association were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The combined results of nine studies--two cohort studies (30,379 unexposed and 30,673 exposed patients) and seven case-control studies (482 CD, 237 UC, and 3198 controls)--which satisfied our selection criteria were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pooled relative risk (adjusted for smoking) associated with oral contraceptive use was 1.44 (1.12, 1.86) for CD and 1.29 (0.94, 1.77) for UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest modest associations between the use of oral contraceptives and the development of CD and UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As these associations are weak, non-causal explanations for the findings cannot be eliminated </plain></SENT>
