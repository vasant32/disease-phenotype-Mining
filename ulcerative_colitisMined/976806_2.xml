<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Isografts grew normally and maintained a structure similar to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Grafts between strains with H2 histocompatibility differences were rejected by 13 days after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early progressive infiltration of the grafts by lymphoid cells was followed by increasing damage to, and subsequent loss of, the epithelial cell layer and destruction of the underlying muscle, changes which parallel those seen in rejection of skin and small bowel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increase in survival time which is seen in allografts between strains with H2 identity was longer in the colon than has been seen in the skin or small bowel; none of the allografts of colon were completely rejected before 30 days, and some remained viable at 50 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the appearances of rejection in the colon with those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and colonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> does not show the striking similarity which is seen between small bowel rejection and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coeliac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Many of the individual features of these diseases are, however, present in the course of colonic rejection </plain></SENT>
