<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> is the only known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> associated with particular HLA alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas the association with the HLA-DRB1*15 allele has been described in several independent studies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, no contribution of HLA alleles to susceptibility in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> has yet been shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: This study was designed to study the strength of association of HLA class II alleles as risk markers for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> in a homogenous population in Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A total of 4251 randomly selected control subjects, and 162 unrelated subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were studied for their HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, and HLA-DQB1 alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHOD: HLA DNA typing was performed after locus specific amplification with the polymerase chain reaction and reverse dot blot hybridisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The HLA-DRB1*07 was the only HLA class II allele found to be significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (relative risk (RR) = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.66 to 2.14; p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This association remained significant after correction for the number of DRB1 alleles compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> before 35 years the RR for the disease in HLA-DRB1*07 positive subjects was found to be higher (RR = 3.1, 95% CI: 2.44 to 3.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The HLA-DRB1*03 was significantly decreased in frequency in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (RR = 0.5, 95% CI: 0.39 to 0.61; p = 0.0028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The HLA-DRB1*07 allele provides risk for the disease especially in patients with younger <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>ages of onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data also provide indirect evidence for an immunogenetically based <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the disease </plain></SENT>
