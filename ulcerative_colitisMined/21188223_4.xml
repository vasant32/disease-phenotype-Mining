<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It seems likely that the microbiota, fractions of the microbiota, or specific species comprising the microbiota provide the antigenic fuel that drives the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> immune <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of the bowel mucosa that is characteristic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At least twenty years of microbiological research have been expended on analysis of the composition of the bowel microbiota of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> patients in comparison to that of control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite extensive speculations about the aetiological role of dysbiosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e>, knowledge that can be easily translated into effective remedies for patients has not eventuated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The causes of this failure may be due to poorly defined and executed bacteriological studies, as well as the overwhelming complexity of a biome that contains hundreds of <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> species and trillions of <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
