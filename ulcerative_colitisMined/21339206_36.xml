<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recommendations for venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (VTE) prophylaxis in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) can be refined by incorporating patient-specific risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> (PE) in children and adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and evaluate whether this risk varies by age and/or presence of other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a cohort study using Danish administrative data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates of DVT and PE were calculated among patients with IBD and an age- and gender-matched comparison population and compared using Cox proportional hazards regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed additional analyses stratifying by age, gender and disease type and restricting outcomes to unprovoked events (occurring without known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, surgery, fracture/trauma or pregnancy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We next performed a nested case-control study to adjust for additional co-morbidities (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) and the use of hormone replacement and antipsychotic medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study included 49,799 patients with IBD (14,211 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 35,229 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>) and 477,504 members of the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>VTE risk was elevated in patients with IBD (HR=2.0 (95% CI 1.8 to 2.1) for total events, HR=1.6 (95% CI 1.5 to 1.8) for unprovoked events) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the incidence of VTE increased with age, the RR was higher in younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among those â‰¤ 20 years old, HRs were 6.0 (95% CI 2.5 to 14.7) for DVT and 6.4 (95% CI 2.0 to 20.3) for PE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After further adjusting for co-morbidity and medication use in the case-control analysis, ORs for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> events remained in the 1.5-1.8 range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Patients with IBD have twice the incidence of PE or DVT as does the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This risk persisted after taking into account other VTE risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Relative risks were particularly high at young ages, though actual incidence increased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings can further inform risk-benefit analysis of VTE prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
