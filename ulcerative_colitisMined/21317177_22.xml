<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Leucocyte migration to gut mucosa, mediated by integrin binding to mucosal addressin cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule (MAdCAM), is a promising target for therapeutic intervention in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This first-in-human study of a monoclonal antibody to MAdCAM, PF-00547,659, aimed to explore the safety and preliminary efficacy of this gut-specific mechanism in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled study, 80 patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> received single or multiple (three doses, 4-week intervals) doses of PF-00547,659 0.03-10 mg/kg IV/SC, or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Safety was assessed by adverse events, laboratory tests, and immunogenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exploratory efficacy analyses were based on Mayo score and endoscopic responder rates at weeks 4 and 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Faecal calprotectin was quantified as a measure of disease activity, and the number of α₄β₇⁺ lymphocytes was measured to demonstrate drug activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No obvious drug-related side effects were observed in the PF-00547,659 group, while patient numbers, especially those fully exposed, were small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall responder/remission rates at 4 and 12 weeks were 52%/13% and 42%/22%, respectively with combined PF-00547,659 doses compared with 32%/11% and 21%/0%, respectively with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Equivalent endoscopic responder rates were 50% and 42% versus 26% and 29%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Faecal calprotectin levels decreased to a greater extent with PF-00547,659 than placebo (week 4: 63% vs 18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite variability, there was a trend for an increase in α₄β₇⁺ lymphocytes in patients receiving PF-00547,659 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The favourable short-term safety profile and preliminary efficacy findings for PF-00547,659 in this first-in-human study pave the way for further investigation in larger trials, to establish the role of PF-00547,659 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
