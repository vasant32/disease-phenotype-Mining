<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Interaction of bacteria with the immune system within the intestinal mucosa plays a key role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to develop a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi>-aided confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) method to visualise intramucosal enteric bacteria in vivo and to determine the involved mucosal area in the colon and ileum in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Initially, E coli strains expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (pEGFP) were endomicroscopically imaged in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, ex vivo and in vivo imaging of fluorescent human enteric bacteria was performed to specify the distinct endomicroscopic appearance of enteral bacteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Targeted mucosal biopsies towards endomicroscopic identifiable intramucosal bacteria and negative mucosal areas were prospectively obtained during colonoscopy and correlated with bench-top fluorescence microscopy (FISH) to prove the endomicroscopic visualisation of intramucosal bacteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, a retrospective analysis as well as a prospective study was performed in patients with UC and CD to confirm the presence and distribution of intramucosal bacteria within the gut </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Confocal endomicroscopy was able to identify intramucosal pEGFP E coli in mice and strains of enteric microflora in the mucosa of humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using FISH as the gold standard, evaluation of 21 patients showed that CLE had a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 100% to identify intramucosal bacteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a retrospective study, 113 patients with CD and UC had intramucosal bacteria significantly more often than 50 control patients (66% vs 60% vs 14%, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This result was confirmed in a prospective study in which 10 patients with CD and 10 with UC had a significantly wider distribution of involvement with intramucosal bacteria in the colon and terminal ileum compared with 10 controls (85.2% vs 75.9% vs 16.8%, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CLE is a new tool that can image intramucosal bacteria in vivo in patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Intramucosal bacteria are found more frequently and with a wider distribution in patients with IBD than in patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intestine </plain></SENT>
