<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A large, population-based inception cohort (the Inflammatory Bowel in South Eastern Norway cohort) was prospectively followed up at 1, 5 and 10 years after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the 10-year follow-up data on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WD</z:e> were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on disability pension (DP) in the background population were retrieved from public databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We calculated overall and age-standardised relative risks (RR) for DP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis was used to examine predictive factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 518 patients completed the 10-year follow-up (response rate 83.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall disability rate in the IBD population was 18.8%, and the RR was 1.8 (95% CI 1.4 to 2.3) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and 2.0 (95% CI 1.4 to 2.7) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The RR for DP was highest in patients aged below 40 years while patients aged over 60 years had no increased RR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Steroid treatment at the 1-year follow-up predicted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WD</z:e> after 10 years disease in both CD and UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In UC, increased C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) at diagnosis, early colectomy, and more than two relapses during the first year of the disease also predicted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ten years after disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> IBD patients had an increased RR for DP as compared with the background population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The youngest patients had the highest RR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Markers of severe disease course predicted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
