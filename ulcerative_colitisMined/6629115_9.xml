<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epithelial cell proliferation in the rectal stump after ileorectal anastomosis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> was studied in 19 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was achieved through in vitro incorporation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53526">tritiated thymidine</z:chebi> in mucosal biopsies and radioautographic analysis of the number and position of labelled nuclei in the crypts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rectal biopsies from nine unoperated patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and from 10 controls, were processed simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Except for one, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were clinically in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The crypt length and number of labelled cells per crypt column were found to be similar in the rectal mucosa from the three groups of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean labelling index, although low 8.9%, was higher (p less than 0.05) in operated patients compared with controls; but the dispersion of individual values was similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was an extension of the proliferative compartment towards the surface in 88% of unoperated patients and in 60% of operated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was a shift of the major zone of proliferation from the lower to the middle third of the crypt in 17% of operated patients and from the lower to the upper third of the crypt in 14% of unoperated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between the labelling index and either the age of patient, the duration of disease or the period elapsed after ileorectal anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, among operated patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> for over 10 years, 42% had a quite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> proliferative pattern with a corresponding mean postoperative period of 7.5 years </plain></SENT>
