<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003040'>arthropathy</z:hpo> is a well-recognised complication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known of its natural history, but a variety of joint involvement has been described, from large joint pauciarticular <z:hpo ids='HP_0003040'>arthropathy</z:hpo> to a rheumatoid pattern <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0702154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polyarthropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To classify the peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003040'>arthropathies</z:hpo> according to pattern of articular involvement, and study their natural history and clinical associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The case notes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients attending the Oxford IBD clinic were reviewed, and information on general disease characteristics, extraintestinal features, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003040'>arthropathy</z:hpo> extracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was confirmed by direct patient interview using questionnaires at routine follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with recorded <z:hpo ids='HP_0001386'>joint swelling</z:hpo> or effusion were classified as type 1 (pauciarticular) if less than five joints were involved and type 2 (polyarticular) if five or more were involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients without evidence of swelling were classified as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 976 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and 483 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Type 1 occurred in 3.6% of patients with UC (83% <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and self-limiting) and in 6.0% of those with CD (79% self-limiting); 83% and 76%, respectively, were associated with relapsing IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Type 2 occurred in 2.5% of patients with UC and 4.0% of those with CD; 87% and 89%, respectively, caused persistent symptoms whereas only 29% and 42%, respectively, were associated with relapsing IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Enteropathic peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003040'>arthropathy</z:hpo> without axial involvement can be subdivided into a pauciarticular, large joint <z:hpo ids='HP_0003040'>arthropathy</z:hpo>, and a bilateral symmetrical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0702154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polyarthropathy</z:e>, each being distinguished by its articular distribution and natural history </plain></SENT>
