<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactive group II PLA2 (IR-PLA2 II) content and PLA2 activity in actively inflamed colonic mucosa of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients were significantly higher than those in inactively inflamed mucosa of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients and the colonic mucosa of controls </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mucosal PLA2 enzymatic activity was closely correlated with mucosal IR-PLA2 II content in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that an increase in PLA2 enzymatic activity in inflamed colonic mucosa of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> was mainly attributed to increased protein content of group II PLA2, and that an increase in mucosal group II PLA2 may be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
