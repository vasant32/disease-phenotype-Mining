<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To study generation of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="16136">hydrogen sulphide</z:chebi> by <z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> reducing bacteria (SRB) and the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in order to identify a role of this noxious agent in pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Fresh faeces were obtained from 37 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (23 with active disease) and 16 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SRB were enumerated from fresh faecal slurries and measurements made of <z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> reducing activity, and <z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="21" ids="16136">hydrogen sulphide</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> on <z:chebi fb="21" ids="16136">hydrogen sulphide</z:chebi> production was studied in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> controls and patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> carried SRB and total viable counts were significantly related to the clinical severity grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SRB were of two distinct types: rapidly growing strains (desulfovibrios) which showed high <z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> reduction rates, present in 30% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 44% of controls; and slow growing strains which had little activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> inhibited <z:chebi fb="35" ids="15138">sulphide</z:chebi> production in a dose dependent manner; in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> not on these drugs faecal <z:chebi fb="35" ids="15138">sulphide</z:chebi> was significantly higher than in controls (0.55 versus 0.25 mM, p=0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Counts and carriage rates of SRB in faeces of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> are not significantly different from those in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SRB metabolism is not uniform between strains and alternative sources of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="16136">hydrogen sulphide</z:chebi> production exist in the colonic lumen which may be similarly inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The evidence for <z:chebi fb="21" ids="16136">hydrogen sulphide</z:chebi> as a metabolic toxin in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> remains circumstantial </plain></SENT>
