<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies have recently been demonstrated in the sera of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three hundred and sixty six sera obtained from 120 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, 105 patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and 49 non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> controls were tested in two laboratories, using an indirect immunofluorescence assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, a fixed-neutrophil enzyme linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA) was evaluated in one of the two laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results in the immunofluorescence test showed a high degree of correlation between the two laboratories (Kappa coefficient = 0.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ninety five of the 120 (79%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients had a positive test whereas only 14 of the 105 (13%) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sera from four patients suffering from primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> were positive as well as four of the 45 control sera (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of the perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody immunofluorescence test for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> was 0.75 with a specificity of 0.88 and a positive predictive value of 0.88 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sera) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the ELISA technique 37 of 94 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> sera and one of the 68 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> sera were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the control group only one of the patients suffering from primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> reacted positively (32 non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> sera tested) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ELISA technique had a high specificity (0.97), but a low sensitivity (0.39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no relation of perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients or in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients with disease activity, duration of illness, localisation, extent of disease, previous bowel operations or medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody positive and negative subsets in both groups of patients thus remains unexplained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our study confirms that determination of serum antineutrophil cytoplasmatic antibodies in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> may differentiate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further immunological studies are needed to explain the absence of these antibodies in a subset of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients and their role in the pathogenesis of the disease </plain></SENT>
