<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the therapeutic effects of the combined use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> and aminosalicylate on mild or moderately active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: According to the national guideline for diagnosis and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) in China, patients with mild or moderately active UC in our hospital were selected from July to November, 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002438" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">amoebiasis</z:e>, or cardiac, renal or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>hepatic failure</z:hpo> and those who had received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi> treatment within the last month were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following a quasi-randomization principle, patients were allocated alternatively into the treatment group (TG) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> 4 mg/d plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> 2 g/d daily or the control group (CG) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> 2 g/d alone, respectively, for 4 wk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical changes were evaluated by Mayo scoring system and histological changes by Truelove-Richards' grading system at initial and final point of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-two patients completed the trial, 21 each in TG and CG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Mayo scores in TG at initial and final points were 5.87 (range: 4.29-7.43) and 1.86 (range: 1.03-2.69) and those in CG were 6.05 (range: 4.97-7.13) and 2.57 (range: 1.92-3.22) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The decrements of Mayo scores were 4.01 in TG and 3.48 in CG, with a remission rate of 71.4% in TG and 57.1% in CG, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Along with the improvement of disease activity index (DAI), the histological grade improvement was more significant in TG than in CG (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Combined treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> achieved better therapeutic effect than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> alone without any side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> can alleviate colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> which hopefully becomes a novel agent for UC treatment </plain></SENT>
