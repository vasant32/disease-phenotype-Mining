<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IL-1 beta was detected in 53% of the patient supernatants (p = 0.0001), IL-2 in 35% (p = 0.0031), compared with none of the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Soluble IL-2R was present in 55% and 26% of the specimens, respectively (p = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of IL-1 beta (p = 0.00015), IL-2 (p = 0.0019), and sIL-2R (p = 0.0073) were highest in the most inflamed biopsy specimens, compared with less inflamed specimens and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in IL-1 beta, IL-2, and sIL-2R concentrations between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (16) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients (15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that enhanced cellular immunity operates in vivo at the mucosal level in active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
