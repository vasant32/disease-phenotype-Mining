<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Phage displayed random <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> technology has been utilised to identify binding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> of antibodies or receptor ligands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aim: To isolates <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> from a phage library which are specifically recognised by antibodies in serum from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A phage displayed random <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> library composed of nine amino acids was established and sequentially screened using serum immunogloblin G obtained from CD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five different CD specific <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were isolated from the phage library </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No homology in amino acid sequences was observed among four (<z:chebi fb="114" ids="17239,3611">CDP</z:chebi>-1, -3 to -5) of the five <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> exhibiting different binding characteristics with each CD patient's serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, two <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="114" ids="17239,3611">CDP</z:chebi>-1 and -2) had similar amino acid sequences and similar binding characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four multiple antigenic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (MAP, <z:chebi fb="114" ids="17239,3611">CDP</z:chebi>-1, -3 to -5) were synthesised, and an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the four <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> was developed to detect serum antibodies against them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty two of 92 CD patients (56.5%) were detected by ELISA, none of 20 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) patients, only one of 25 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002588'>duodenal ulcer</z:hpo> patients, and only three of 48 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ELISA using the four <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> isolated in this study may be useful for the differential diagnosis of CD and UC </plain></SENT>
