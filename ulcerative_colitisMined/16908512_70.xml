<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the role of mucus in the spatial separation of intestinal bacteria from mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Mucus barrier characteristics were evaluated using histological material obtained by biopsy from purged colon, colon prepared with enema and material from untreated appendices fixed with non-aqueous Carnoy solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bacteria were evaluated using fluorescence in situ hybridization, with <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26833">16S</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> probes and related to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi> Schiff alcian blue stain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biopsies from controls (n = 20), patients with self-limiting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (SLC; n = 20), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (n = 20) and 60 randomly selected appendices were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mucosal surface beneath the mucus layer was free of bacteria in &gt; or =80% of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appendices and biopsies from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The thickness of the mucus layer and its spread decreased with increasing severity of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>; the epithelial surface showed <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> adherence, epithelial tissue defects and deep mucosal infiltration with bacteria and leucocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bacteria and leucocytes were found within mucus in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> biopsy specimens from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, SLC, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">appendicitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The concentration of bacteria within mucus was inversely correlated to the numbers of leucocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The large bowel mucus layer effectively prevents contact between the highly concentrated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> bacteria and the epithelial cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parts of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is always accompanied by breaks in the mucus barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> gradually reduces the number of bacteria in mucus and faeces, the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> itself is not capable of preventing <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> migration, adherence to and invasion of the mucosa </plain></SENT>
