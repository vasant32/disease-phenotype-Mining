<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have shown that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) is associated with the presence of lamina propria non-invariant (Type II) NKT cells producing IL-13 and mediating epithelial cell cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we sought to define the antigen(s) stimulating the NKT cells and to quantitate these cells in the UC lamina propria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Detection of Type II NKT cells in UC lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) with lyso-sulfatide loaded tetramer and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50853">quantum dot</z:chebi>-based flow cytometry and staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Culture of UC LPMCs with lyso-sulfatide <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> to determine sulfatide induction of epithelial cell cytotoxicity, IL-13 production and IL-13Rα2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blinded <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50853">quantum dot</z:chebi>-based phenotypic analysis to assess UC LPMC expression of IL-13Rα2, CD161 and IL-13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Approximately 36% of UC LPMC were lyso-sulfatide tetramer positive, whereas few, if any, control LPMCs were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When tested, the positive cells were also CD3 and IL-13Rα2 positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Culture of UC LPMC with lyso-sulfatide <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> showed that sulfatide stimulates UC LPMC production of IL-13 and induces UC CD161 LPMC-mediated cytotoxicity of activated epithelial cells; additionally, lyso-sulfatide induces enhanced expression of IL-13Rα2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, blinded phenotypic analysis of UC LP MC using multicolour <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50853">quantum dot</z:chebi>-staining technology showed that approximately 60% of the LPMC bear both IL-13Rα2 and CD161 and most of these cells also produce IL-13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These studies show that UC lamina propria is replete with Type II NKT cells responsive to lyso-sulfatide <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> and bearing IL-13Rα2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since lyso-sulfatide is a self-antigen, these data suggest that an <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune response</z:mp> is involved in UC pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
