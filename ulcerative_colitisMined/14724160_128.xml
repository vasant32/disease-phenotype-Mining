<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Colonoscopic surveillance for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in longstanding extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> relies heavily on non-targeted mucosal biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chromoendoscopy can aid detection of subtle mucosal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that routine pancolonic indigo carmine dye spraying would improve the macroscopic detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and reduce the dependence on non-targeted biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred patients with longstanding extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> attending for colonoscopic surveillance underwent "back to back" colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the first examination, visible abnormalities were biopsied, and quadrantic non-targeted biopsies were taken every 10 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pancolonic indigo carmine (0.1%) was used during the second colonoscopic examination, and any additional visible abnormalities were biopsied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median extubation times for the first and second colonoscopies were 11 and 10 minutes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The non-targeted biopsy protocol detected no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 2904 biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty three mucosal abnormalities (20 patients) were detected during the pre-dye spray colonoscopy of which two (two patients) were dysplastic: both were considered to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> associated lesions/masses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of 114 additional abnormalities (55 patients) were detected following dye spraying, of which seven (five patients) were dysplastic: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were considered to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a strong trend towards statistically increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> detection following dye spraying (p = 0.06, paired exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The targeted biopsy protocol detected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in significantly more patients than the non-targeted protocol (p = 0.02, paired exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was detected in 2904 non-targeted biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In comparison, a targeted biopsy protocol with pancolonic chromoendoscopy required fewer biopsies (157) yet detected nine dysplastic lesions, seven of which were only visible after indigo carmine application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Careful mucosal examination aided by pancolonic chromoendoscopy and targeted biopsies of suspicious lesions may be a more effective surveillance methodology than taking multiple non-targeted biopsies </plain></SENT>
