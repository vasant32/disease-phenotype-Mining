<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although robust evidence exists in support of the use of these drugs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, a close evaluation of the available data in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> reveals a much weaker evidence base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In particular, randomised controlled trials of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>, the most commonly used <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agent</z:chebi>, do not provide rich evidence of efficacy whereas observational cohorts suggest this agent is effective, particularly in patients with relapsing disease who require <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Ciclosporin</z:chebi> is also effective in the most refractory cases but its efficacy needs to be carefully weighed against the possibility of rare but life threatening complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the evidence base in support of immunosuppressive drugs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> is not as strong as in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, these agents clearly have a role in the treatment of this disease </plain></SENT>
