<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is significant geographic variation in the reported incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To update the incidence and prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in Olmsted County, Minnesota, examine temporal trends, and determine overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> Olmsted County residents diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> between 1940 and 1993 (incidence cases), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> residents with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> alive on 1 January 1991 (prevalence cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Incidence and prevalence rates were adjusted using 1990 US census figures for whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects of age, sex, and calendar year on incidence rates were evaluated using Poisson regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival from diagnosis was compared with that expected for US north-central whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 1940 and 1993, 278 incidence cases were identified, for an adjusted incidence rate of 7.6 cases per 100 000 person years (95% confidence interval (CI), 6.7 to 8.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On 1 January 1991, there were 218 residents with definite or probable <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, for an adjusted prevalence rate of 229 cases per 100 000 (95% CI, 198 to 260) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased incidence rates were associated with later calendar years (p&lt;0.002), younger age (p&lt;0.0001), urban residence (p&lt;0.0001), and male sex (p&lt;0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was similar to that expected (p&gt;0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in Olmsted County increased until the 1970s, and remained stable thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates among men and urban residents were significantly higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The prevalence rate in Rochester in 1991 was 19% higher than that in 1980 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was similar to that of the general population </plain></SENT>
