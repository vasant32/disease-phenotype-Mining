<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients (39 F, 30 M) dependent upon/refractory to steroids were treated with GMA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Steroid dependency, clinical activity index (CAI), C reactive protein (CRP) level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), values at baseline, use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi>, duration of disease, and age and extent of disease were considered for statistical analysis as predictive factors of clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the univariate analysis, CAI (P = 0.039) and ESR (P = 0.017) levels at baseline were singled out as predictive of clinical remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis steroid dependency [Odds ratio (OR) = 0.390, 95% Confidence interval (CI): 0.176-0.865, Wald 5.361, P = 0.0160] and low CAI levels at baseline (4 &lt; CAI &lt; 7) (OR = 0.770, 95% CI: 0.425-1.394, Wald 3.747, P = 0.028) proved to be effective as factors predicting clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: GMA may be a valid therapeutic option for steroid-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients with mild-moderate disease and its clinical efficacy seems to persist for 12 mo </plain></SENT>
