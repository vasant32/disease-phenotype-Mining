<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The role of mycobacteria, specifically Mycobacterium <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paratuberculosis</z:e>, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> has aroused considerable controversy for many years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using the ultra sensitive polymerase chain reaction some studies have reported detection of M <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paratuberculosis</z:e> DNA in as many as 65% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients but also in patients without disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other studies have been negative for both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore designed a double blind control trial to investigate the presence of mycobacterial DNA in age, sex, and tissue matched paraffin wax embedded tissues from 31 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> tissues, 20 diseased gut control tissues, and 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The specimens were coded and analysed blind with three separate polymerase chain reactions (PCR) based on DNA sequences specific for M <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paratuberculosis</z:e> (IS900), M avium (RFLP type A/1) (IS901), and the Mycobacterium genus (65 kDa gene, TB600) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of granulomata and presence of acid fast bacilli in each <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> tissue was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of the system was determined using similarly prepared gut tissue from an animal infected with M <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paratuberculosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four of 31 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> tissues and none of the 30 control and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> derived tissues amplified M <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paratuberculosis</z:e> DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> tissues containing granulomata were significantly more likely to amplify M <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paratuberculosis</z:e> specific DNA on PCR than the non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> tissues (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> tissues contained granulomata, and none contained acid fast bacilli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Equivalent numbers of Crohn's and non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> tissues amplified the region of the 65 kD gene on PCR for non-specific mycobacterial DNA (11/31 and 9/30 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No sections produced an amplified product with the IS901 PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that few <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> gut biopsy sections contain M <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paratuberculosis</z:e> DNA in association with granulomata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The absence of such DNA in any control and ulcerative colitic tissue strengthens the case for it having a specific association, which may be pathogenic, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> in this minority of patients </plain></SENT>
