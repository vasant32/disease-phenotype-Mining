<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The clinical course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> is characterised by a succession of relapses and remissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to assess whether the predictive value of faecal calprotectin-a non-invasive marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp>-for clinical relapse is different in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy nine consecutive patients with a diagnosis of clinically quiescent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (38 CD and 41 UC) were followed for 12 months, undergoing regular clinical evaluations and blood tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A single stool sample was collected at the beginning of the study from each patient and the calprotectin concentration was assessed by a commercially available enzyme linked immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In CD, median calprotectin values were 220.1 mug/g (95% confidence interval (CI) 21.7-418.5) in those patients who relapsed during follow up, and 220.5 mug/g (95% CI 53-388) in non-relapsing patients (p=0.395) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In UC, median calprotectin values were 220.6 mug/g (95% CI 86-355.2) and 67 microg/g (95% CI 15-119) in relapsing and non-relapsing patients, respectively (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The multivariate Cox (proportional hazard) regression model, after adjustment for possible confounding variables, showed a twofold and 14-fold increase in the relapse risk, respectively, in those patients with CD and UC in clinical remission who had a faecal calprotectin concentration higher than 150 microg/g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Faecal calprotectin proved to be an even stronger predictor of clinical relapse in UC than in CD, which makes the test a promising non-invasive tool for monitoring and optimising therapy </plain></SENT>
