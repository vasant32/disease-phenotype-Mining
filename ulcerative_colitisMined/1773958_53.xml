<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using kappa statistics 16 of 41 histological features were sufficiently reproducible for further stepwise discriminant analysis to differentiate between CIBD and non-CIBD, and between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the combination of three features (an increase of lymphocytes and plasma cells in the lamina propria, the presence of branching of crypts, and neutrophils in the crypt epithelium) we were able to distinguish CIBD from non-CIBD in 89% of the cases with high probability (p greater than 0.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To separate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> three features (an excess of histiocytes in combination with a villous or irregular aspect of the mucosal surface and granulomas) had a high predictive value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using these features 70% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients and 75% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients were correctly classified with a high probability (p greater than 0.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the pathologist is dependent on the presence of only a few histological features for a reliable classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
