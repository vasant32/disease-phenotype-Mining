<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He was clinically and endoscopically diagnosed with flare of UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After informed consent had been obtained, he was treated with <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-IFN-α-2a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four weeks after initiation of <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-IFN therapy, his <z:hpo ids='HP_0011458'>abdominal symptoms</z:hpo> gradually subsided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intracellular cytokine assay revealed that the ratio of T-helper (Th) 1 (IFN-?)/Th 2 (IL-4) increased after IFN therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three months after starting IFN therapy, colonoscopy revealed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosal pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>He was uneventfully treated with <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-IFN-α-2a for one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When last seen in November 2006, he was still in remission of UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our intracellular cytokine data suggested that alteration of Th1/Th2 cytokine balance by IFN is one possible mechanisms of reducing <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> in patients with UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this regard, IFN therapy could be useful for some patients with UC refractory to other conventional therapies </plain></SENT>
