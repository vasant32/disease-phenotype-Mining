<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This review is mainly devoted to describing the current knowledge of the impact of some of these factors on the outcome of IBD, with special emphasis on smoking and diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the impact of smoking on the susceptibility to develop CD and UC is firmly established, its influence on the clinical course of both diseases is still debatable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In CD, active smoking is a risk factor for postoperative recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Beyond this clinical setting, smoking cessation seems to be advantageous in those CD patients who were smokers at disease diagnosis, while smoking resumption may be of benefit in ex-smokers with resistant UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The role of dietary habits on the development of IBD is far from being well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341286,C0149696" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Sign or Symptom" abbrv="">food intolerances</z:e> are very frequent, but usually inconsistent among IBD patients, and therefore no general dietary recommendations can be made in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In general, IBD patients should eat a diet as varied as possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regarding the possible therapeutic role of some dietary components in IBD, lessons should be drawn from the investigation of the primary therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Low-fat diets seem to be particularly useful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Also, some <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> sources, such as olive oil, medium-chain <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and perhaps <z:chebi fb="6" ids="25681">omega-3 fatty acids</z:chebi>, might have a therapeutic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fermentable fiber may have a role in preventing relapses in inactive UC </plain></SENT>
