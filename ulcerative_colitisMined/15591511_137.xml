<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To describe the clinical features and outcomes of PSC-IBD and compare these to a group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (CUC) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with PSC-IBD evaluated at the Mayo Clinic Rochester between 1987 and 1992 were abstracted for information on endoscopic and histological features, colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, surgery, and other clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients referred for colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and those who did not undergo colonoscopy with biopsies were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A control group of CUC patients matched for sex, duration of IBD at first clinic visit, and calendar year of first clinic visit was identified, and similar information was abstracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy one PSC-IBD patients and 142 CUC patients without PSC were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rectal sparing and backwash <z:mp ids='MP_0009482'>ileitis</z:mp> were more common in the PSC-IBD group (52% and 51%, respectively) than in controls (6% and 7%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> developed in 18 cases and 15 controls, including 11 cancers (seven cases and four controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An increased risk of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was not detected in a matched analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the cumulative incidence of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was higher in cases (33%) than in controls (13%) at five years, this was of borderline statistical significance (p=0.054, unmatched log rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall survival from first clinic visit was significantly worse among cases (79% v 97%) at five years (p&lt;0.001, unmatched log rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PSC-IBD is frequently characterised by rectal sparing and backwash <z:mp ids='MP_0009482'>ileitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> develops in a substantial fraction and overall survival is worse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>PSC-IBD may represent a distinct IBD phenotype </plain></SENT>
