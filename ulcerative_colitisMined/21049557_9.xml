<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed 1707 Hungarian and Czech subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) (n = 810, age: 37.1 ± 12.6 years, duration: 10.7 ± 8.4 years) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) (n = 428, age: 43.7 ± 15.0 years, duration: 12.6 ± 9.9 years), as well as 469 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IRGM rs13361189, NKX2-3 rs10883365 and ECM1 rs13294 polymorphisms were tested by LightCycler allele discrimination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Detailed clinical phenotypes were determined by reviewing the medical charts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NKX2-3 rs10883365 variant allele was associated with increased risk for CD (P = 0.009, OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.06-1.48) and UC (P = 0.001, OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.13-1.63), whereas variant IRGM allele increased risk for CD (P = 0.029, OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.03-1.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, ECM1 rs13294 was not associated with either CD or UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In CD, the variant IRGM allele was associated with a colon-only location (P = 0.02, OR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.07-2.44), whereas in UC, the ECM1 variant was associated with cutaneous manifestations (P = 0.002, OR = 3.36, 95% CI = 1.48-7.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Variant alleles did not predict resistance to steroids or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>, efficacy of infliximab, or need for surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NKX2-3 and IRGM are susceptibility loci for IBD in Eastern European patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to confirm the reported phenotype-genotype associations </plain></SENT>
