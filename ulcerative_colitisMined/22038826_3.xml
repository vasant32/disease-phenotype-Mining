<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetics of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> and its poor systemic bioavailability suggest that it targets preferentially intestinal epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intestinal epithelium, an essential component of the gut innate defense mechanisms, is profoundly affected by IFN-γ, which can disrupt the epithelial barrier function, prevent epithelial cell migration and wound healing, and prime epithelial cells to express major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) molecules and to serve as nonprofessional antigen-presenting cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report we demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> inhibits IFN-γ signaling in human and mouse colonocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">Curcumin</z:chebi> inhibited IFN-γ-induced gene transcription, including CII-TA, MHC-II genes (HLA-DRα, HLA-DPα1, HLA-DRβ1), and T cell chemokines (CXCL9, 10, and 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Acutely, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> inhibited Stat1 binding to the GAS cis-element, prevented Stat1 nuclear translocation, and reduced Jak1 phosphorylation and phosphorylation of Stat1 at Tyr(701) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Longer exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> led to endocytic internalization of IFNγRα followed by lysosomal fusion and degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> acts as an IFN-γ signaling inhibitor in colonocytes with biphasic mechanisms of action, a phenomenon that may partially account for the beneficial effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and in human IBD </plain></SENT>
