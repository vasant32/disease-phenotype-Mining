<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) is characterised by infiltration of inflamed mucosal regions with CD4(+) T lymphocytes and other mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interleukin (IL)-16 exerts a strong chemoattractant activity on CD4(+) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, IL-16 activates expression and production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-15, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in human monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: To examine if IL-16 expression is increased in IBD patients compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty one patients with IBD (10 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), 11 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD)), seven disease specificity controls (DSC), and seven healthy controls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were taken during colonoscopies and IL-16 mRNA as well as protein expression were investigated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, ELISA, western blot, and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IL-16 mRNA and protein expression in the colonic mucosa of IBD patients were increased twofold compared with healthy controls, DSC, or IBD patients under steroid treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most of the detected IL-16 protein was in its bioactive 17 kDa form and was predominantly expressed in eosinophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased IL-16 expression in UC patients appeared to be mainly restricted to the inflamed regions of the colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Levels of caspase 3, which processes the 68 kDa IL-16 precursor molecule into the biological active 17 kDa form, were not increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence that IL-16 expression is significantly increased in the inflamed colonic mucosa of IBD patients but not in control individuals, DSC, or patients under steroid treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, upregulation of IL-16 expression seems to be specific for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> and could lead to increased secretion of other proinflammatory cytokines in IBD </plain></SENT>
