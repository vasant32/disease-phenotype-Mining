<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is associated with tissue remodeling in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD), we evaluated serum TIMP-1 and TIMP-4 levels in IBD patients, in comparison with healthy controls (HC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: TIMP-1, TIMP-2 and TIMP-4 serum levels were determined in 53 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), 52 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and 50 HC, by means of commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The levels of TIMPs were evaluated with regard to the levels of inflammatory markers, such as C reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) and the clinical characteristics of patients, so that potential correlations could be recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean serum TIMP-1 levels were 414.9 +/- 17.6 ng/mL in UC patients, 446.1 +/- 22.8 ng/mL in CD patients and 296.5 +/- 20.6 ng/mL in HC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>UC and CD patients had significantly higher serum TIMP-1 levels when compared to HC, (p &lt; 0.0001 in both groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean serum TIMP-1 levels were significantly higher in patients with active IBD (450.5 ng/mL) in comparison with patients with inactive disease (417.3 ng/mL, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, males showed significantly higher mean serum TIMP-1 levels (399.8 ng/mL), compared to females (368.5 ng/mL, p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean serum TIMP-2 levels did not differ between UC and CD patients or HC (p &gt; 0.05 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean serum TIMP-4 levels were 1761.2 +/- 67.7 pg/mL in UC patients, 1708.1 +/- 73.4 pg/mL in CD patients and 5573.4 +/- 1246.3 pg/mL in HC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>UC and CD patients had significantly lower serum TIMP-4 levels when compared to HC (p = 0.008 and p = 0.02 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean serum TIMP-4 levels were significantly lower in males (2772.9 pg/mL), compared to females (3299.0 pg/mL, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, CRP levels showed a statistically significant correlation with TIMP-1 (r = 0.247, p = 0.01), and TIMP-4 levels (r = 0.217, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there was a statistically significant correlation between SAA levels and both TIMP-1 (r = 0.264, p = 0.008) and TIMP-4 serum levels (r = 0.212, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An imbalance between TIMP-1 and TIMP-4 serum levels is present in IBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>TIMP-1 levels could be used not only for diagnostic purposes but also for the assessment of activity in IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Gender tends to influence TIMP-1 and TIMP-4 serum levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These new findings bring into question the potential role of TIMPs in IBD, thus underlining the need for future studies which could offer new insight into this matter </plain></SENT>
