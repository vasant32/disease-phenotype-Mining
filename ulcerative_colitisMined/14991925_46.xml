<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the etiology is incompletely understood, initiation and aggravation of the inflammatory process seem to be due to a massive local mucosal immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a regulatory cytokine which inhibits both antigen presentation and subsequent pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and it is proposed as a potent anti-inflammatory biological therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many methods of IL-10 as a treatment for IBD have been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The new strategies of IL-10 treatment, including recombinant IL-10, the use of genetically modified bacteria, gelatine microsphere containing IL-10, adenoviral vectors encoding IL-10 and combining regulatory T cells are discussed in this review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The advantages and disadvantages of these IL-10 therapies are summarized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although most results of recombinant IL-10 therapies are disappointing in clinical testing because of lacking efficacy or side effects, therapeutic strategies utilizing gene therapy may enhance mucosal delivery and increase therapeutic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Novel IL-10-related cytokines, including IL-19, IL-20, IL-22, IL-24, IL-26, IL-28 and IL-29, are involved in regulation of inflammatory and immune responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The use of IL-10 and IL-10-related cytokines will provide new insights into cell-based and gene-based treatment against IBD in near future </plain></SENT>
