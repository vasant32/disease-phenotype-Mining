<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective is the investigation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001382'>Joint Hypermobility</z:hpo> (JH) and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152093" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hypermobility Syndrome</z:e> (HMS) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined 83 patients with IBD and 67 healthy individuals for the presence of JH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were excluded if they were under 18 or over 50 years of age and if they had other conditions which affect joint mobility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The x(2) and the Fisher exact test were used appropriately between study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (ORs) for the risk of JH and HMS in IBD groups were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 150 individuals (83 IBD patients and 67 healthy controls) participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>69 IBD patients, 41 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's Disease</z:hpo> (CD) and 28 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), were finally eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>JH was detected in 29 CD patients (70.7%), in 10 UC patients (35.7%), and in 17 healthy control subjects (25.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant difference was detected on JH in CD patients as compared to UC patients (P = .0063) and controls (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The estimated OR for JH was 7.108 (95% CI: 2.98-16.95) in CD and 1.634 (95% CI: 0.63-4.22) in UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HMS was detected in 5 (12.2%) CD and in 1 (3.57%) UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The OR for HMS in CD was 3.75 (95% CI: 0.41-34.007), while 7 (17.1%) CD patients had overlapping symptoms for both HMS and early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0949691" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SPDA1">spondylarthropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: JH and the HMS are common in CD patients, thus articular manifestations should be carefully interpreted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This implies an involvement of collagen varieties in the pathogenesis of IBD </plain></SENT>
