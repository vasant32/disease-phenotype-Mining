<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new model has been developed to characterise the effect of a standardised ileal exclusion on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi>, cholesterol, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> metabolism in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients treated by colectomy and ileostomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> were studied on two occasions: firstly with a conventional ileostomy and then three months afterwards with an ileal pouch operation with an ileoanal anastomosis and a protective loop ileostomy, excluding on average 95 cm of the distal ileum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ileostomy contents were collected during 96 hours and the excretion of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> and cholesterol was determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood and duodenal bile samples were collected on two consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the exclusion of the distal ileum, both cholic and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16755">chenodeoxycholic acid</z:chebi> excretion in the ileostomy effluent increased four to five times without any change in cholesterol excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum concentrations of lathosterol (a marker of cholesterol biosynthesis) and 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol (a marker for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> biosynthesis) were increased several fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47776">VLDL triglycerides</z:chebi> were also increased whereas the concentrations of total and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B were decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no changes in biliary <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> composition or cholesterol saturation of bile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results show that the exclusion of about 95 cm of distal ileum causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0002024'>malabsorption</z:hpo> of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> but apparently not of cholesterol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002024'>malabsorption</z:hpo> leads to increased synthesis of both <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> and cholesterol in the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> can regulate cholesterol synthesis by a mechanism independent of the effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> on cholesterol absorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The enhanced demand for cholesterol also leads to a decrease in plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002024'>malabsorption</z:hpo> of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> did not affect biliary <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> composition or cholesterol saturations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47776">VLDL triglycerides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
