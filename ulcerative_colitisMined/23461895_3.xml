<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is expressed in higher levels in the colonic tissue and plasma of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This phase II study assessed the efficacy and safety of BMS-936557, a fully human, monoclonal antibody to IP-10, in the treatment of moderately-to-severely active UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: In this 8-week, phase II, double-blind, multicentre, randomised study, patients with active UC received placebo or BMS-936557 (10 mg/kg) intravenously every other week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the rate of clinical response at Day 57; clinical remission and mucosal healing rates were secondary endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Post hoc analyses evaluated the drug exposure-response relationship and histological improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 109 patients were included (BMS-936557: n=55; placebo: n=54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prespecified primary and secondary endpoints were not met; clinical response rate at Day 57 was 52.7% versus 35.2% for BMS-936557 versus placebo (p=0.083), and clinical remission and mucosal healing rates were 18.2% versus 16.7% (p=1.00) and 41.8% versus 35.2% (p=0.556), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, higher BMS-936557 steady-state trough concentration (Cminss) was associated with increased clinical response (87.5% vs 37.0% (p&lt;0.001) for patients with Cminss 108-235 μg/ml vs placebo) and histological improvements (73.0% vs 41.0%; p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infections</z:e> occurred in 7 (12.7%) BMS-936557-treated patients and 3 (5.8%) placebo-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>2 (3.6%) BMS-936557 patients discontinued due to adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Anti-IP-10 antibody, BMS-936557, is a potentially effective therapy for moderately-to-severely active UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Higher drug exposure correlated with increasing clinical response and histological improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further dose-response studies are warranted </plain></SENT>
