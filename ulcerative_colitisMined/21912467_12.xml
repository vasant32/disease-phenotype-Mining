<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Imaging of the morphological characteristics of IBD includes the assessment of mucosal alterations, transmural involvement and extraintestinal manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No single imaging technique serves as a diagnostic gold standard to encompass <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> disease manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allow cross-sectional imaging of the transmural alterations and extraintestinal manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While in the USA the technique of choice is CT, in Europe the focus is more on MRI and ultrasound (US) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> IBD are diagnosed at a young age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After baseline diagnosis many of these young patients have to undergo repetitive imaging procedures during the variable clinical course of the disease, characterized by alternate periods of remission and active disease, and in monitoring the response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>US has the advantage of being noninvasive, less costly, and easily repeatable, and thus can be very useful in following up patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, rising concern about radiation exposure in young adults indicates the demand for radiation-sparing techniques like US and MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This article focuses on the current clinical practice of US in IBD, describing the current technologies used in transabdominal intestinal US and the characteristic sonographic findings in CrohnÂ´s disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
