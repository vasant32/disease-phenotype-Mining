<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To explore the pathophysiological significance of <z:mp ids='MP_0002534'>delayed type hypersensitivity</z:mp> (DTH) reaction in mouse gastrointestinal tract induced by an allergen <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34718">2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34718">DNCB</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: BALB/c mice were randomly divided into control and DTH(1-6) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After sensitized by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34718">DNCB</z:chebi> smeared on the abdominal skin, the mice were challenged with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34718">DNCB</z:chebi> by gavage or enema </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The weight, stool viscosity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>hematochezia</z:hpo> were observed and accumulated as disease active index (DAI) score; the gastrointestinal motility was represented by active charcoal propulsion rate; the colon pathological score was achieved by macropathology and HE staining of section prepared for microscopy; and the leukocyte migration inhibitory factor (LMIF) activity was determined by indirect capillary assay of the absorbance (A) of migrated leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Active charcoal propulsion rates of small intestine in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34718">DNCB</z:chebi> gavages groups were significantly higher than that in the control group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The DAI scores and pathological score in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34718">DNCB</z:chebi> enema groups were also higher than that in the control group (P&lt;0.05), and there were significant rises in LMIF activity in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34718">DNCB</z:chebi> enema groups as compared with control groups (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Mouse gastrointestinal DTH reaction could be induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34718">DNCB</z:chebi>, which might facilitate the mechanism underlying the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
