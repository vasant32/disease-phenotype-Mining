<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To explore the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002438" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">amebiasis</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) in Turkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, amoeba prevalence in 160 cases of IBD, 130 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 30 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> were investigated in fresh faeces by means of wet mount+Lugol's <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> staining, modified formol <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27750">ethyl acetate</z:chebi> and trichrome staining methods and to compare the diagnostic accuracy of wet mount+Lugol's <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> staining, modified formol <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27750">ethyl acetate</z:chebi> and trichrome staining methods in the diagnosis of Entamoeba histolytica (E. histolytica)/ Entamoeba dispar (E. dispar) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: E. histolytica/E. dispar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> and trophozoites were found in 14 (8.75 %) of a total of 160 cases, 13 (10.0 %) of the 130 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 1 (3.3 %) of the 30 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As for the 105 patients in the control group who had not any gastrointestinal complaints, 2 (1.90 %) patients were found to have E. histolytica /E. dispar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> in their faeces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Parasite prevalence in the patient group was determined to be significantly higher than that in the control group (Fischer's Exact Test, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the three methods of determining parasites were compared with one another, the most effective one was found to be trichrome staining method (Kruskal-Wallis Test, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Consequently, amoeba <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> in IBD cases have a greater prevalence compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The trichrome staining method is more effective for the detection of E. histolytica /E. dispar than the wet mount+Lugol's <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> staining, modified formol <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27750">ethyl acetate</z:chebi> methods </plain></SENT>
