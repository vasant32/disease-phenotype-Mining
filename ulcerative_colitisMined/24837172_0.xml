<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Over 100 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) loci have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) primarily in Caucasians (CEUs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many of them have weak effects on disease susceptibility, and the bulk of the heritability cannot be ascribed to these loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Very little is known about the genetic background of UC in non-CEU groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we report the first GWAS on UC in a genetically distinct north Indian (NI) population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A genome-wide scan was performed on 700 cases and 761 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>18 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (p&lt;5×10(-5)) were genotyped in an independent cohort of 733 cases and 1148 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A linear mixed model was used for case-control association tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven novel human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-independent SNPs from chromosome 6, located in 3.8-1, BAT2, MSH5, HSPA1L, SLC44A4, CFB and NOTCH4, exceeded p&lt;5×10(-8) in the combined analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To assess the independent biological contribution of such genes from the extended HLA region, we determined the percentage alternative pathway activity of complement factor B (CFB), the top novel hit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The activity was significantly different (p=0.01) between the different genotypes at rs12614 in UC cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transethnic comparisons revealed a shared contribution of a fraction of UC risk genes between NI and CEU populations, in addition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows varying contribution of the HLA region to UC in different populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Different environmental exposures and the characteristic genetic structure of the HLA locus across ethnic groups collectively make it amenable to the discovery of causative alleles by transethnic resequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This may lead to an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying UC </plain></SENT>
