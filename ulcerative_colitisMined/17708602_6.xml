<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The development of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>) therapy as a life long treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> is reviewed from its origins in the 1940s to the present day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The drug was designed to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, but was found helpful in the management of nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This discovery preceded the emergence of the clinical trial as a tool for assessing a new drug's efficacy; as a result it lacked scientific rigour and was selective in its presentation of results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless it identified the future cornerstone of therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 1962, the first double blind controlled trial of sulphasalazine was conducted on 40 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures were subjective and included symptoms and an assessment of the rectal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 1973, the first two papers on the role of sulphasalazine in maintenance of remission were published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both used placebo controls and had a stratified design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were measured using "an intention to treat" approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The British study of 64 patients used both subjective and objective criteria to assess outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients on placebo had a relapse rate four times patients on active treatment and this founded the basis for a life long approach to therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> compounds in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, in 1985, a small "on demand" study of 32 patients suggested this approach might be as effective as continuous treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Some support for this view came from an Italian study which showed no benefit to continued treatment for those in remission for two years or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The central problem these studies identify is that of adherence to treatment in the long-term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Few studies have considered patients' attitudes to continuous therapy and it is an area that needs further investigation </plain></SENT>
