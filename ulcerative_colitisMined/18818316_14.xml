<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although it has been demonstrated effective in reducing relapse rate in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi>'s effectiveness in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) or in Th-1/Th-17 mediated immune models of CD has not been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the effects of dietary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> (0.1-1%) on the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, immune activation, and in vivo NF-kappaB activity in germ-free IL-10(-/-) or IL-10(-/-);NF-kappaB(EGFP) mice colonized with specific pathogen-free microflora </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Proximal and distal colon <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> showed a mild protective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> only at 0.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colonic IFN-gamma and IL-12/23p40 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression followed similar pattern ( approximately 50% inhibition at 0.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secretion of IL-12/23p40 and IFN-gamma by colonic explants and mesenteric lymph node cells was elevated in IL-10(-/-) mice and was not decreased by dietary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, activation of NF-kappaB in IL-10(-/-) mice (phospho-NF-kappaBp65) or in IL-10(-/-);NF-kappaB(EGFP) mice (whole organ or confocal imaging) was not noticeably inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we demonstrate that IL-10 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> act synergistically to downregulate NF-kappaB activity in IEC and IL-12/23p40 production by splenocytes and dendritic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> demonstrates limited effectiveness on Th-1 mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in IL-10(-/-) mice, with moderately improved colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, but with no significant effect on pathogenic T cell responses and in situ NF-kappaB activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies suggest that the protective effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> are IL-10 dependent </plain></SENT>
