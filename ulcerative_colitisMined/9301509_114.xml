<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The pathology of non-alcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0006280'>chronic pancreatitis</z:hpo> has not yet been sufficiently studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To identify the major changes of pancreatic tissue in patients surgically treated for non-alcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0006280'>chronic pancreatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Pancreatectomy specimens from 12 patients with non-alcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0006280'>chronic pancreatitis</z:hpo>, including four patients with autoimmune or related diseases (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sj√∂gren's syndrome</z:e>, primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>), were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Morphological changes were studied histologically and immunohistochemically (to type inflammatory cells) and compared with the pancreatic alterations found in 12 patients with alcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0006280'>chronic pancreatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients with non-alcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0006280'>chronic pancreatitis</z:hpo>, with or without associated autoimmune or related diseases, <z:mp ids='MP_0001869'>pancreatic inflammation</z:mp> particularly involved the ducts, commonly resulting in duct obstruction and occasionally duct destruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of these features was seen in alcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0006280'>chronic pancreatitis</z:hpo> which, however, showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_468'>pseudocysts</z:mpath> and calcifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The pancreatic changes in patients with non-alcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0006280'>chronic pancreatitis</z:hpo> clearly differ from those with alcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0006280'>chronic pancreatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The term <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> duct destructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> is suggested for this type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030286" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pancreatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
