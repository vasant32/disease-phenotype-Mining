<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been introduced in the diagnosis of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is still rarely reported in paediatric IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the diagnostic value of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhanced MRI in revealing <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of the distal ileum in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and in differentiating them from patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> of the gut </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI was performed using a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>) solution as oral contrast agent to distend the small bowel (CE-<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seventy five consecutive patients (median age 13.6 years, range 8-17) with suspected CD underwent ileocolonoscopy with biopsy and CE-<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD activity was measured by the paediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> activity index (PCDAI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CE-<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-MRI was evaluated with an overall score calculated, taking into account both wall thickness and contrast enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Active CD with distal <z:mp ids='MP_0009482'>ileitis</z:mp> was diagnosed in 26 cases, active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) in 18, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0949691" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SPDA1">spondyloarthropathy</z:e> and indeterminate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0949272" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ileocolitis</z:e> in 11; 20 children served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CD patients, CE-<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-MRI revealed a marked ileal involvement with increased wall thickness and parietal contrast enhancement and showed a high concordance with endoscopy and histology, whereas the test was negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 18 UC patients, CE-<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-MRI was negative in 15 and showed a mild parietal contrast enhancement of the terminal ileum in only three of seven patients with backwash <z:mp ids='MP_0009482'>ileitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0949691" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SPDA1">spondyloarthropathy</z:e> patients, six had mucosal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> and five mild superficial <z:mp ids='MP_0009482'>ileitis</z:mp>: CE-<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-MRI was negative in four and revealed only mild parietal contrast enhancement of the ileal wall in seven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CE-<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-MRI did not show an increase in wall thickness of the distal ileum in any of the UC or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0949691" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SPDA1">spondyloarthropathy</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of CE-<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-MRI related to the presence of erosive <z:mp ids='MP_0009482'>ileitis</z:mp>, as documented by endoscopy, were 84% and 100%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, the test correlated markedly with endoscopy and histology in the entire population (r=0.94; r=0.95, respectively) as well as with the PCDAI in CD patients (r=0.91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In children with active CD, CE-<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-MRI is a very sensitive and specific test for the detection of distal <z:mp ids='MP_0009482'>ileitis</z:mp> and for differentiation from other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> of the gut </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The test could also be useful for the firstline diagnostic approach in children with suspected CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The high correlation of CE-<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-MRI with ileal endoscopy and histology as well as with PCDAI makes this test of great interest for future studies as a tool for monitoring the clinical course and the effect of therapy in CD patients </plain></SENT>
