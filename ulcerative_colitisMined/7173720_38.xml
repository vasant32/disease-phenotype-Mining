<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A series of experiments has been performed in healthy male volunteers to investigate the disposition of orally administered disodium azodisalicylate, a potentially useful drug for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The drug was given by mouth in doses of up to 2 g a day for six weeks and there were no adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum concentrations of the intact compound were low and the serum half-time was 4-12.8 days, probably because of a combination of a low clearance rate and a high apparent volume of distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Less than 5% of the ingested dose was excreted unchanged in the urine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Circulating concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> and N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-5-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> were low and 30% of the equivalent daily dose was excreted in the urine, predominantly as N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-5-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In most subjects more than 30% of the equivalent daily dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> was recovered from the faeces, either as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> itself or as the acetylated derivative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> has been shown to be the active therapeutic moiety of sulphasalazine, disodium azodisalicylate appears to be suitable for therapeutic trial in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
