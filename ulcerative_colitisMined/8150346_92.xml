<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean values for right and left colon and rectum were 107 (48), 134 (68), and 155 (54) microns respectively with a significant difference between right colon and rectum (p = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Values in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> showed greater variation and in those areas with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> mucosa was denuded of the mucus layer </plain></SENT>
