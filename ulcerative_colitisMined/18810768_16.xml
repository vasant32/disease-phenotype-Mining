<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both are <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> conditions with frequent complications and surgical procedures and a great impact on patient's quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35221">antimetabolites</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50667">6-mercaptopurine</z:chebi> are widely used in IBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Current indications include maintenance therapy, steroid-dependent disease, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> closure, prevention of infliximab immunogenicity and prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the wide use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> in the last decades has not decreased the need of surgery, probably because these treatments are introduced at too late stages in disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An earlier use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> is now advocated by some authors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rational includes: (1) failure to modify IBD natural history of present therapeutic approach, (2) demonstration that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> can induce mucosal healing, a relevant prognostic factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and (3) demonstration that early immunosuppression has a very positive impact on pediatric, recently diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We are now awaiting the results of new studies, to clarify the contribution of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>, as compared to infliximab (SONIC Study), and to demonstrate the usefulness of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> in recently diagnosed adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients (AZTEC study) </plain></SENT>
