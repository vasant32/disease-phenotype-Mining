<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To identify specific colonoscopic findings in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) complicated by cytomegalovirus (CMV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among UC patients who were hospitalized due to exacerbation of symptoms, colonoscopic findings were compared between 15 CMV-positive patients and 58 CMV-negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> was determined by blood test for CMV antigenemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five aspects of mucosal changes were analyzed (loss of vascular pattern, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo>, mucosal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, easy <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, and mucinous exudates) as well as five aspects of ulcerative change (wide mucosal defect, punched-out ulceration, longitudinal ulceration, irregular ulceration, and cobblestone-like appearance) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of each finding for CMV positivity were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sensitivity of irregular ulceration for positive CMV was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The specificity of wide mucosal defect was 95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Punched-out ulceration and longitudinal ulceration exhibited relatively high sensitivity and specificity (more than 70% for each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Specific colonoscopic findings in patients with UC complicated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings may facilitate the early diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> in UC patients </plain></SENT>
