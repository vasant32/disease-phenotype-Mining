<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty patients with CD (15 with at least one NOD2/CARD15 mutation), 29 with UC, and 10 with no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD). were tested for MAP by polymerase chain reaction (specific IS900 fragment) and blood culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MAP DNA was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> original blood samples and 8-wk blood cultures (CD, UC and non-IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Positive MAP DNA status was confirmed by dot blot assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 69 cultures were negative by acid-fast Ziehl-Neelsen staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Viable MAP, in spheroplast form, was isolated from the 18-mo blood cultures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 30 CD patients, one UC patient, and none of the non-IBD controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No association was found between positive MAP cultures and use of immunosuppressive drugs or CD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MAP is widely present in our area and MAP DNA can be recovered from the blood of CD, UC and non-IBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, MAP spheroplasts were only found in CD patients </plain></SENT>
