<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We designed a case-series study in the gastroenterology centre of the Internal Medicine department of Cairo University, which is a tertiary care referral centre in Egypt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in whom the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) was confirmed by clinical, laboratory, endoscopic, histological and/or radiological criteria over the 15 year period from 1995 to 2009, and we studied their sociodemographic and clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic examinations were performed by 2 senior experts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This hospital centre serves patients from Cairo, as well as patients referred from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other parts of Egypt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our centre received 24156 patients over the described time period for gastro-intestinal consultations and/or interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 157 patients with established IBD were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, 135 patients were diagnosed with UC (86% of the total), and 22 patients, with CD (14% of the total) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean ages at diagnosis were 27.3 and 29.7, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, we noticed a marked increase in the frequency of both UC and CD diagnoses during the most recent 10 years of the 15 year period studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Regarding the gender distribution, the male:female ratio was 1:1.15 for UC and 2.6:1 for CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of follow up for patients with UC was 6.2 ± 5.18 years, while the mean duration of follow up for patients with CD was 5.52 ± 2.83 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For patients with UC we found no correlation between the severity of the disease and the presence of extraintestinal manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients had surgical interventions during the studied years: 4 cases of total colectomy and 7 cases of anal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We observed a ratio of 6:1 for UC to CD in our series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The incidence of IBD seems to be rising in Egypt </plain></SENT>
