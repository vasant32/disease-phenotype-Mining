<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been a big puzzle as why the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) is limited to the mucosa, while in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is transmural and can be seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> layers of the gut </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, I give a tentative explanation extended from the unified hypothesis I proposed on the etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis suggested that both UC and CD are caused by weakening of the gut barrier due to damage of the protective mucus layer and the underlying tissue by the poorly inactivated digestive proteases resulting from a reduction of gut bacteria by dietary chemicals like saccharin and sucralose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the large amounts of bacteria in the colon make the recruitment of neutrophils and formation of crypt <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> the main manifestation of UC, while the infiltration of antigens and dietary particles in the small and large intestine mainly cause the recruitment of macrophages and formation of granulomas as the main manifestations in CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The fast reacting and <z:mp ids='MP_0002083'>short life span</z:mp> of neutrophils make the fight and damage limited to the surface of the mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the long life span and constant movement of macrophages may bring the harmful agents deep into the tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the pathogenesis of UC may be more like <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, while CD may be more like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pneumoconiosis</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e> of the lung </plain></SENT>
