<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate ASCA production over time in CD and murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in order to further our understanding of their etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-six CD patients were compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022104" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IBS">irritable bowel syndrome</z:e> patients with respect to ASCA production as measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ASCA IgG or IgA positivity as well as change in titers over a period of up to 3 years (Delta IgG/A) was correlated with clinical parameters such as CD activity index (CDAI) and C-reactive protein levels (CRP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, two murine models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (DSS and IL-10 knock out) were compared to control animals with respect to ASCA titers after oral yeast exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ASCA IgG and IgA titers are stable over time in CD and non-CD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fistular disease was associated with a higher rate of ASCA IgA positivity (P = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ileal disease</z:e> was found to have a significant influence on the Delta IgG of ASCA (P = 0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation found between ASCA positivity or Delta IgG/A and clinical parameters of CD: CDAI and CRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In mice, neither healthy animals nor animals with DSS-induced or spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> exhibited a marked increase in ASCA titers after high-dose yeast exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, mice immunized intraperitoneally with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28808">mannan</z:chebi> plus adjuvant showed a marked and significant increase in ASCA titers compared to adjuvant-only immunized controls (P = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The propensity to produce ASCA in a subgroup of CD patients is largely genetically predetermined as evidenced by their stability and lack of correlation with clinical disease activity parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, mere oral exposure of mice to yeast does not lead to the induction of marked ASCA titers irrespective of concomitant colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Hence, environment may play only a minor role in inducing ASCA </plain></SENT>
