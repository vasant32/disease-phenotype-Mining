<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The IBD5 region on chromosome 5q31 is one of only two loci widely confirmed to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> in multiple independent cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although many populations have demonstrated association with IBD5, there remains uncertainty as to the causal variant within the region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A recent report identified polymorphisms in SLC22A4 (OCTN1) and SLC22A5 (OCTN2) as being responsible for the IBD5 association, however, these findings have not been replicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review discusses the data evaluating the IBD5 locus and the OCTN genes and their relationship to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several other genes, including IRF1 and P4HA2 may be equally as likely to contain the IBD5 causal variant as the OCTN genes </plain></SENT>
