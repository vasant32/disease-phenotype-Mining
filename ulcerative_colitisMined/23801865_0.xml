<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty consecutive patients with AIH attended the University Clinic at Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Iran for a 12 mo period and were assessed in a case series study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serological and biochemical evaluations were carried out in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Autoantibodies, such as antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-smooth muscle antibody (ASMA), anti-liver-kidney microsomal antibody (ALKM-1) type 1, and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (P-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi>) were evaluated in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A liver biopsy was performed after diagnosis of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated in terms of their signs and symptoms, and laboratory results and the degree to which they corresponded with the diagnostic criteria of IAHG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this study, both a comprehensive diagnostic scoring system and a simplified diagnostic scoring system were employed for AIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty patients, 20 male, 40 female, mean age 39.45 Â± 17.50 years, participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment began immediately after enrolment into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The percent distribution of the study population into definite and probable did not change after the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common symptoms in descending order were <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (100%), icter (66.7%), abdominal discomfort (33.3%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003270'>abdominal distension</z:hpo> (28.3%), dark urine (23.3%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> (23.3%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002248'>hematemesis</z:hpo> (20.0%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000989'>pruritus</z:hpo> (20.0%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002249'>melena</z:hpo> (11.7%) and pale stool (10.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At the physical examination, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>hepatomegaly</z:hpo>, epigastric tenderness and an abdominal mass were found in 50.0%, 16.7%, 13.3%, 5.0% and 3.3% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0010702'>Hypergammaglobulinemia</z:hpo> was detected in 95.0% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>ALKM-1, P-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi>, ANA and ASMA were positive in 71.4%, 66.7%, 42.4% and 19.4% of cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0580174" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Portal hypertensive gastropathy</z:e> (45.0%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002040'>esophageal varices</z:hpo> (41.7%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> (40.0%) were the most prevalent complications of AIH, and there was no evidence of primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410000" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">overlap syndrome</z:e> in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>According to IAHG criteria, 80.0% of cases had a definite diagnosis, 15.0% had a probable diagnosis and 5.0% had no AIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The percent distribution of the study population into definite, probable and no AIH did not change after using the simplified diagnostic scoring system for AIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This research showed that the majority of cases in our study were appropriately diagnosed according to the IAHG criteria and simplified scoring system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Thus, these criteria are very useful </plain></SENT>
