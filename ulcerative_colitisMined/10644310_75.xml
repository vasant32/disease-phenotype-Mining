<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 998 self administered questionnaires were issued to members of the Danish <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>Colitis</z:hpo>/Crohn Association, and 1000 questionnaires were issued to randomly selected control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>845 patients (84.5%) and 645 controls (65.4%) returned the questionnaire (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>817 patients and 635 controls could be analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analysis was performed on 383 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (median age 39, range 8-82 years; median age at diagnosis 26, range 1-75 years), 434 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (median age 39, range 11-86 years; median age at diagnosis 29, range 10-78 years), and 635 controls (median age 43, range 19-93 years, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fracture risk was increased in female patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (relative risk (RR) = 2.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-3.6), but not in male patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (RR = 0.6, 95% CI 0.3-1.3) or in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (RR = 1.1, 95% CI 0.8-1.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An increased proportion of low energy fractures was observed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (15.7% versus 1.4 % in controls, 2p&lt;0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>01), but not in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (5.4%, 2p=0.30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increased fracture frequency in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> was present for fractures of the spine, feet, and toes and fractures of the ribs and pelvis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fracture risk increased with increasing duration of systemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> use in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (2p=0.028), but not in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (2p=0.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An increased risk of low energy fractures was observed in female patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, but not in male patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> or in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
