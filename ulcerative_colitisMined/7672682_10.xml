<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown the presence in faeces of sulphatases, sialidases, glycosidases, and proteases relevant to mucus degradation, but the relative role of these enzymes in the degradation of colonic mucus has been unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total mucinase assay using <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi> threonine biologically labelled human colonic mucin as substrate was therefore developed in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Faecal mucinase activity of a pooled <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> faecal filtrate was capable of removing 80% of the <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi> threonine label from mucin within eight hours incubation, but 20% remained intact despite prolonged incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pH profile of mucinase activity is broad (pH 4.5-9.5) suggesting contribution from multiple enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mucinase activity was reduced by preincubation with 100 micrograms/ml chymostatin (82.8%), 0.5 mg/ml EDTA (91.6%), and 4 g/l <z:chebi fb="6" ids="33301">bismuth</z:chebi> subsalicylate (72.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 55 faecal samples studied contained detectable mucinase activity, measured as dpm release/micrograms protein/hour, which was greater in samples from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (n = 17, median 52.7, interquartile range 32.9-66.9), than controls (n = 26, 34.4, 26.8-40.4, p &lt; 0.02) or patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (n = 12, 35.5, 17.5-55.7, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was, however, no significant difference in faecal mucinase activity between inactive and active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that faecal mucinase activity is one factor contributing to the thin mucus layer in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and represents a potential target for drug treatment </plain></SENT>
