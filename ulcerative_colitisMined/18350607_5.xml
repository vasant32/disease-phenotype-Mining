<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the role of nuclear factor of activated T cell 2 (NFAT2), the major NFAT protein in peripheral T cells, in sustained T cell activation and intractable <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used two-dimensional gel-electrophoresis, immunohistochemistry, double immunohistochemical staining, and confocal microscopy to inspect the expression of NFAT2 in 107, 15, 48 and 5 cases of UC, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), non-specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, and 5 healthy individuals, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Up-regulation with profound <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33252">nucleo</z:chebi>-translocation/activation of NFAT2 of lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) of colonic mucosa was found specifically in the affected colonic mucosa from patients with UC, as compared to CD or NC (P &lt; 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="33252">Nucleo</z:chebi>-translocation/activation of NFAT2 primarily occurred in CD8+T, but was less prominent in CD4+ T cells or CD20+B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was strongly associated with the disease activity, including endoscopic stage (tau = 0.2145, P = 0.0281) and histologic grade (tau = 0.4167, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We disclose for the first time the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33252">nucleo</z:chebi>-translocation/activation of NFAT2 in lamina propria mononuclear cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Activation of NFAT2 was specific for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and highly associated with disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since activation of NFAT2 is implicated in an auto-regulatory positive feedback loop of sustained T-cell activation and NFAT proteins play key roles in the calcium/calcineurin signaling pathways, our results not only provide new insights into the mechanism for sustained intractable <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, but also suggest the calcium-calcineurin/NFAT pathway as a new therapeutic target for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
