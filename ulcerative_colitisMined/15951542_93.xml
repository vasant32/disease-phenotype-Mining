<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Oral aminosalicylates are well established in the treatment of active mild/moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) when the disease is extensive (that is, beyond the splenic flexure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of clinical symptoms relate to disease activity in the distal part of the colon and therefore this study was designed to investigate if adding a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> enema to oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> has additional benefit for patients with extensive mild/moderate active UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A randomised double blind study was performed in 127 ambulatory patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> received 4 g/day (twice daily dosing) oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> for eight weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the initial four weeks, they additionally received an enema at bedtime containing 1 g of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was assessed using the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> disease activity index, with clinical and endoscopic signs at four and eight weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Remission was obtained in 44% (95% confidence interval (CI) 31%, 58%) of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> enema group (Me) and in 34% (95% CI 21%, 49%) of the placebo enema group (Pl) at four weeks (p = 0.31) and in 64% (95% CI 50%, 76%) of the Me group versus 43% (95% CI 28%, 58%) of the Pl group at eight weeks (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Improvement was obtained in 89% (95% CI 78%, 96%) of the Me group versus 62% (95% CI 46%, 75%) of the Pl group at four weeks (p = 0.0008) and in 86% (95% CI 75%, 94%) of the Me group versus 68% (95% CI 53%, 81%) of the Pl group at eight weeks (p = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with extensive mild/moderate active UC, the combination therapy is superior to oral therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is safe, well accepted, and may be regarded as firstline treatment </plain></SENT>
