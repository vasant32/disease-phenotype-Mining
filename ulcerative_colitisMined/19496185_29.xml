<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, a significant number of children with IBD, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) have impaired linear growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nutrition has an important role in the management of IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In adults with CD, enteral nutrition (EN) is effective in inducing clinical remission of IBD, although it is less efficient than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exclusive EN is an established primary therapy for pediatric CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Limited data suggests that EN is as efficient as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> for induction of remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional advantages of nutritional therapy are control of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, mucosal healing, positive benefits to growth and overall nutritional status with minimal adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The available evidence suggests that supplementary EN may be effective also for maintenance of remission in CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More studies are needed to confirm these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, EN supplementation could be considered as an alternative or as an adjunct to maintenance drug therapy in CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>EN does not have a primary therapeutic role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Specific compositions of enteral diets-elemental diets or diets containing specific components-were not shown to have any advantage over standard polymeric diets and their place in the treatment of CD or UC need further evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Recent theories suggest that diet may be implicated in the etiology of IBD, however there are no proven dietary approaches to reduce the risk of developing IBD </plain></SENT>
