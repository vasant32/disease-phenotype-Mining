<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: G protein deficient (G alpha i2-/-) mice spontaneously develop an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) closely resembling <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated that gut T cells are hyperreactive to the endogenous microflora in most IBD models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The aim of this study was to analyse Peyer's patches (PP), the inductive sites for gut mucosal immune responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects and methods: G alpha i2-/- mice, an animal model for IBD, were analysed using immunological methods with regard to phenotype and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found significantly decreased numbers of PP in G alpha i2-/- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Even before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, G alpha i2 deficient animals exhibited diminished size of PP, as judged by histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This <z:mpath ids='MPATH_624'>involution</z:mpath> of PP was associated with strongly increased levels of apoptotic lymphocytes, associated with decreased levels of antiapoptotic intracellular protein Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PP T lymphocytes showed highly elevated production of interferon gamma in response to the enteric flora compared with PP T cells from <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, which produced predominantly interleukin 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thus even before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, the PP in G alpha i2 deficient mice is a Th1 dominated milieu associated with downregulated levels of Bcl-2, resulting in <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> of lymphocytes leading to regression of PP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We speculate that this Th1 dominated microenvironment in the inductive site for mucosal immune responses contributes to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in G alpha i2 deficient mice </plain></SENT>
