<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These conditions have become increasingly common in recent years, including in children and young people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although much is known about aspects of the pathogenesis of these diseases, the precise aetiology is not yet understood, and there remains no cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent data has illustrated the importance of a number of genes-several of these are important in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of IBD in early life, including in infancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pain, diarrhoea and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> are typical symptoms of paediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151594" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bloody diarrhoea</z:e> is more typical of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, atypical symptoms may occur in both conditions: these include isolated impairment of linear growth or presentation with extra-intestinal manifestations such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Growth and nutrition are commonly compromised at diagnosis in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consideration of possible IBD and completion of appropriate investigations are essential to ensure prompt diagnosis, thereby avoiding the consequences of diagnostic delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patterns of disease including location and progression of IBD in childhood differ substantially from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Various treatment options are available for children and adolescents with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Exclusive enteral nutrition plays a central role in the induction of remission of active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Medical and surgical therapies need to considered within the context of a growing and developing child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The overall management of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> conditions in children should include multi-disciplinary expertise, with focus upon maintaining control of gut <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, optimising nutrition, growth and quality of life, whilst preventing disease or treatment-related complications </plain></SENT>
