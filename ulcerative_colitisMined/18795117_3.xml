<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given that transdermal <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> benefits <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), and there is a considerable overlap in the treatment of UC and CD, the possible beneficial effect of <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> has been examined in patients with Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To assess the efficacy and safety of <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> enemas in active Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients with active rectosigmoid CD; 3 patients were excluded because they received antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects were given 6 mg <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> enemas, each day for 4 weeks, in an open pilot study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the beginning and end of the trial, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> activity index (CDAI) score was calculated, sigmoidoscopy was performed, and haematological inflammatory markers measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean CDAI decreased from 202 to 153-the score was reduced in 6 patients, unchanged in 3, and increased in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Frequency of bowel movements decreased in 8 patients and the sigmoidoscopy grade was reduced in 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean C-reactive protein decreased from 22.0 to 12.3 mg/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no withdrawals due to adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this relatively small study of patients with active Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, 6 mg <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> enemas appeared to be of clinical benefit in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>They were well tolerated and safe </plain></SENT>
