<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Selected areas were given fluorescence intensity scores without knowledge of whether <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or reactive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> was present as judged by another observer from conventional histopathological features in adjacent sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two types of lesion did not differ significantly with regard to the expression of the three marker antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a prospective study based on cold <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>-fixed mucosal biopsy samples, lesions from 11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were compared blindly with lesions from six patients with reactive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> and with samples obtained endoscopically from eight <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The range of disease-associated fluorescence intensity scores was wide, but staining for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> markers tended to be brighter in reactive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the controls, the fluorescence intensity score tended to be lower for carcinoembryonic antigen but was significantly (P less than 0.01) higher for secretory component and epithelial IgA than in both types of lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, staining for secretory component and epithelial IgA in the lesions seemed to be inversely related to the grade of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and the degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No such trend was seen for carcinoembryonic antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The wide ranges of individual fluorescence scores precluded the possibility of applying carcinoembryonic antigen, secretory component, and epithelial IgA as immunohistochemical markers to differentiate between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and reactive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> in routine diagnostic work </plain></SENT>
