<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Symptoms include <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">itch</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001254'>lethargy</z:hpo> and in advanced cases <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">end-stage liver disease</z:e>, however increasing numbers of asymptomatic individuals are being identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The disease is rare in the general population but is strongly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) affecting up to 5% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, with a slightly lower prevalence (up to 3.6%) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The strength of this association means that the vast majority (&gt; 90%) of patients with PSC also have IBD, although many may have only mild gastro-intestinal symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Usually IBD presents before PSC, although vice-versa can occur and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of both conditions can be separated in some cases by many years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean age of diagnosis of PSC is in the fifth decade of life with a strong male predominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Risk is increased in those with a family history of PSC, suggesting a genetic predisposition and the disease is almost exclusive to non-smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> associated with PSC is characteristically mild, runs a quiescent course, is associated with rectal sparing, more severe right sided disease, backwash <z:mp ids='MP_0009482'>ileitis</z:mp> and has a high risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> post-colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most worrisome is the high risk of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> which necessitates routine colonoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_354'>Cholangiocarcinoma</z:mpath> is also a frequent complication of PSC with a 10%-15% lifetime risk of developing this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment with high dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9907">ursodeoxycholic acid</z:chebi> offers some chemoprotective effects against colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and may decrease symptoms, biochemical and histological progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Small duct PSC patients characteristically have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cholangiography, and liver biopsy is required for diagnosis, it appears to have a more favourable prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>Hepatitis</z:hpo> (AIH) is also more prevalent in patients with IBD, with up to 16% of patients with AIH also having <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A small subgroup of patients have a AIH-PSC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410000" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">overlap syndrome</z:e> and the management of these patients depends on liver histology, serum IgM levels, autoantibodies, degree of biochemical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001396'>cholestasis</z:hpo> and cholangiography as some of these patients may respond to immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
