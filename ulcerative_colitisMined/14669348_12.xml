<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their activity can be counterbalanced by the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) on MMP-1 and TIMP-1 plasma concentrations, as two possible biomarkers of the disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MMP-1 and TIMP-1 plasma concentrations were measured with an enzyme immunoassay in 16 patients with endoscopically confirmed active UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma concentrations of both MMP-1 (13.7 +/- 0.2 ng/ml) and TIMP-1 (799 +/- 140 ng/ml) were significantly elevated in UC patients in comparison to healthy controls (11.9 +/- 0.9 ng/ml and 220 +/- 7 ng/ml respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between TIMP-1 and MMP-1 concentrations (r=-0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TIMP-1 levels revealed significant positive correlations with scored endoscopic degree of mucosal injury, disease activity index and clinical activity index values as well as C-reactive protein concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between MMP-1 and laboratory, clinical or endoscopic indices of the disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results confirm the role of both MMP-1 and TIMP-1 in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However only TIMP-1 can be useful as a biomarker of the disease activity, demonstrating association with clinical and endoscopic pictures </plain></SENT>
