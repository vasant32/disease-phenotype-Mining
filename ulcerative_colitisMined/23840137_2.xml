<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IBD can be caused by both genetic and environmental factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an immunoregulatory cytokine that has been identified as being involved in several diseases including IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studies have shown that polymorphisms in the promoter region reduce serum levels of IL-10 and this reduction has been associated with some forms of IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mouse models have shown promising results with IL-10 supplementation, as such IL-10 supplementation has been touted as being a possible alternative treatment for CD in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials have shown that recombinant human IL-10 is safe and well tolerated up to a dose of 8 Î¼g/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, to date, the results of the clinical trials have been disappointing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although CD activity was reduced as measured by the CD activity index, IL-10 supplementation did not result in significantly reduced remission rates or clinical improvements when compared to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This review discusses why IL-10 supplementation is not effective in CD patients currently and what can be addressed to potentially make IL-10 supplementation a more viable treatment option in the future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on the current research we conclude that IL-10 supplementation is not a one size fits <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment and if the correct population of patients is chosen then IL-10 supplementation could be of benefit </plain></SENT>
