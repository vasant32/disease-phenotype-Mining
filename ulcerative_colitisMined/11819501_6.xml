<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Colonic mucosa was prepared from human fresh surgical colonic specimens, homogenized by adding appropriate amount of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline and centrifuged at 3000r/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The supernatant was collected for measurement of protein conentration and then mixed with Freund adjuvant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This antigen fluid was first injected into the plantae of the model group rats, and then into their plantae, dorsa, inguina and abdominal cavities (noFreund adjuvant for the last injection) again on the 10th, 17th, 24th and 31st day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When a certain titer of serum anti colonic antibody was reached, 2% formalin and antigen fluid (no Freund adjuvant) were administered separately by enema </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> rat model was thus set up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The animals were randomly divided into four groups: model control group (MC, n = 8), electro acupuncture group (EA, n = 8), herbs partition moxibustion group (HPM 8), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group (NC,n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HPM: Moxa cones made of refined mugwort floss were placed on the medicinal pad (medicinal pad dispensing: Radix Aconiti praeparata, cortex Cinnamomi, etc) for Qihai (RN 6) and Tianshu (ST 25, bilateral) and ignited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two moxa cones were used for each acupoint once a day and 14 times in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EA: Tianshu (bilateral) and Qihai were stimulated by the intermittent pulse with 2Hz frequency, 4mA intensity for 20 minutes once a day and 14 times in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After treatment, rats of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four groups were killed simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The spleen was separated and the distal colon was dissected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Total tissue <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was isolated by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30087">guanidinium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18022">thiocyanate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="59" ids="35255">chloroform</z:chebi> extraction method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR technique was used to study the expression of IL-1 beta and IL-6 mRNA.RESULTS:IL-1 beta and IL-6 mRNAs were not detected in the spleen and colonic mucosa of the NC rats, whereas they were significantly expressed in that of the MC rats.IL-1 beta and IL-6 mRNAs were markedly lower in the EA and HPM rats than that in MC rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the levels of IL-1 beta and IL-6 mRNAs in the EA and HPM rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The expressions of IL-1 beta and IL-6 mRNAs were nearly the same in the spleen and colon of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups.CONCLUSION:Acupuncture and moxibustion greatly inhibited the expression of IL-1 beta and IL-6 mRNA in the experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> rats </plain></SENT>
