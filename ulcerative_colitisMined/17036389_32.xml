<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the prevalence of abnormalities of the uterine cervix in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) when compared to healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and sixteen patients with IBD [64 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and 52 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC)] were matched to 116 healthy controls by age (+/- 2 years) at the time of most recent papanicolaou (Pap) smear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data collected consisted of age, race, marital status, number of pregnancies, abortions/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e>, duration and severity of IBD, Pap smear results within five years of enrollment, and treatment with immunosuppressive drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pap smear results were categorized as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or abnormal including atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302773" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="LSIL">low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302773" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="LSIL">LGSIL</z:e>), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333875" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="HSIL">high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion</z:e> (HGSIL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age at the time of Pap smear was 46 (range: 17-74) years for the IBD group and matched controls (range: 19-72 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were more Caucasian subjects than other ethnicities in the IBD patient group (P = 0.025), as well as fewer abortions (P = 0.008), but there was no significant difference regarding marital status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighteen percent of IBD patients had abnormal Pap smears compared to 5% of controls (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis of the IBD patients revealed no significant differences between CD and UC patients in age, ethnicity, marital status, number of abortions, disease severity, family history of IBD, or disease duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed in the number of abnormal Pap smears or the use of immunosuppressive medications between CD and UC patients (P = 0.793) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No definitive observation could be made regarding HPV status, as this was not routinely investigated during the timeframe of our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Diagnosis of IBD in women is related to an increased risk of abnormal Pap smear, while type of IBD and exposure to immunosuppressive medications are not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This has significant implications for women with IBD in that Pap smear screening protocols should be conscientiously followed, with appropriate investigation of abnormal results </plain></SENT>
