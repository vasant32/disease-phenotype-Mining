<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To explore whether there was anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) positivity in our patients with biopsy-confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> (42 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>) and gluten sensitive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002242'>enteropathy</z:hpo> (16 patients) from Debrecen, Hungary were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was made using the formally accepted criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA) and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA), antiendomysium antibodies (EMA), antigliadin antibodies (AGA) and anti human tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTGA) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results showed that ASCA positivity occurred not only in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> but also in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>Celiac disease</z:hpo> and in these cases both the IgG and IgA type antibodies were proved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is conceivable that ASCA positivity correlates with the (auto-) immune <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of small intestines and it is a specific marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
