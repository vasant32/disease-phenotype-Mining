<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The potential of endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) for treating flat dysplastic lesions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (CUC) has not been addressed so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Historically, such lesions were referred for colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there are only limited data to support endoscopic resection of exophytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>-like mass (ALM) lesions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To evaluate the safety and clinical outcomes of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> undergoing EMR for Paris class 0-II and class I ALM compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary aims were to re-evaluate the prevalence, anatomical "mapping" and histopathological characteristics of both Paris class 0-II and class I lesions in the context of CUC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective clinical, pathological and outcome data of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>-associated Paris class 0-II and Paris class I ALM treated with EMR (primary end points being <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> development, resection efficacy, metachronous lesion rates and post-resection recurrence rates) were compared with those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 204 lesions were diagnosed in 169 patients during the study period: 167 (82%) diagnosed at "entry" colonoscopy, and 36 (18%) diagnosed at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>170 ALMs, 18 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-associated lesion masses (DALMs) and 16 cancers were diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 4316 colonoscopies were performed throughout the study period (median per patient: 6; range: 1-8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up period for the complete cohort was 4.1 years (range: 3.6-5.21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>1675 controls were included from our prospective database of patients without CUC who had undergone EMR for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> Paris class 0-II and snare polypectomy of Paris type I lesions from 1998 onwards, and were considered to be at moderate to high lifetime risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>3792 colonoscopies were performed throughout the study period in this group (median per patient: 4; range: 1-7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up period was 4.8 years (range: 2.9-5.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences were observed between the CUC study group and controls with respect to age, sex, median number of colonoscopies per patient, median follow-up duration, post-resection complications, median lesional diameter or interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, there was a significant between-group difference regarding the prevalence of Paris class 0-II lesions in the CUC group (82/155 (61%)) compared with controls (285/801 (35%); chi(2) = 31.13; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, recurrence rates of lateral spreading <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were higher in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> cohort (1/7 (14%)) than among controls (0/10 (0%); p = 0.048 (95% CI 11.64% to 40.21%)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Flat DALM, similarly to Paris class I ALM, can be managed safely by EMR in CUC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A change in management paradigm to include EMR for the resection of flat dysplastic lesions in selected cases is proposed </plain></SENT>
