<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> is an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> of the colonic and rectal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Autoantibodies have been observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> which may have a role in the pathogenesis of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evidence also suggests that there is an hereditary predisposition towards the disease, although no individual genes have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: This is a pilot study of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes (IgH) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> to determine whether they have any particular genetic characteristics which may lead to a better understanding of the disease aetiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Colonic or rectal tissue was obtained from five children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tissue was also obtained from five children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and five children who did not have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: B cells and IgD+ B cells were identified by immunohistochemistry on frozen sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Areas of lamina propria containing plasma cells, and areas of IgD+ B cells were microdissected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The immunoglobulin genes were PCR amplified, cloned, and sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sequences were analysed for content of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> and composition of heavy chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An increase in the use of JH6 and DXP'1, and a decrease in the use of JH4, gene segments in immunoglobulin genes from lamina propria plasma cells, and from virgin IgD+ B cells, was found in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These biases were not present in the control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a fundamental difference in the immunoglobulin genes from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Whether this is caused by a difference in content of immunoglobulin gene segments in the germline or a difference in the recombination mechanism is not known </plain></SENT>
