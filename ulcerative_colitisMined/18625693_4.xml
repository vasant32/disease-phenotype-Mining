<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Defects in Fas-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> are supposed to contribute to the accumulation of T lymphocytes in the gut of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon has been functionally linked with the elevated expression of Flip, an inhibitor of Fas-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the molecular mechanisms that control Flip in CD were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Paired colonic biopsies of patients with CD, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were analysed for Flip by real-time PCR and western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flip was also evaluated in CD3(+) lamina propria lymphocytes (T-LPLs) cultured with tosyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25987">phenylalanyl</z:chebi> chloromethyl <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17087">ketone</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9642">TPCK</z:chebi>; a nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) inhibitor), AG490 (a Janus kinase 2 (Jak2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) inhibitor) or 17-desmethoxy-17-N,N-dimethylamino-geldanamycin (DMAG; an inhibitor of heat shock protein 90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was examined by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In CD, upregulation of Flip occurred at both the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and protein level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment of CD CD3(+) T-LPLs with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9642">TPCK</z:chebi> or AG490 markedly reduced Flip <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, suggesting a role for NF-kappaB and Jak/Stat pathways in the transcriptional control of Flip in this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consistently, both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9642">TPCK</z:chebi> and AG490 sensitised CD T-LPLs to Fas-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Flip protein in cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gut was rapidly degraded by the proteasome pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in inflamed gut of both CD and UC patients, there was a reduced degradation of Flip via the ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent pathway, but Flip expression can be decreased by DMAG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrate that Flip is regulated at both the transcriptional and post-translational level in CD, and indicate that in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> but not inflamed gut Flip is degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent pathway </plain></SENT>
