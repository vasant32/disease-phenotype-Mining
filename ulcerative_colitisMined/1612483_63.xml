<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate their clinical significance, sera from 126 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (80 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and 46 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 22 patients with primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> were examined for pANCA by indirect immunofluorescence on liver sections and cytocentrifuge slides of neutrophils and by immunoblot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Perinuclear antibodies against neutrophils were found in 83% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in 88% of patients with primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, in 40% of patients with primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> but without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, and in 25% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> using the immunofluorescence test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Titres of pANCA ranged from 1:10 to 1:1000 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> (median 1:100), whereas in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> only four patients had titres of more than 1:10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of pANCA did not correlate with clinical activity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> whereas in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> high titres of pANCA were found mainly in active disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using an immunoblot system with sonified neutrophils as antigen, 82% of sera from patients with primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> reacted with up to five different determinants, whereas only 12% of sera from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and 11% of sera with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> detected one of the determinants, suggesting different antigens involved in pANCA reaction </plain></SENT>
