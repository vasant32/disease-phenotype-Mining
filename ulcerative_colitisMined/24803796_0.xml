<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent findings demonstrate the common genetic basis for many <z:mpath ids='MPATH_194'>immune-mediated diseases</z:mpath>, and consequently, the partially shared pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We collected these findings and reviewed the extension of these overlaps to other disease characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> were selected that also share the specific target organ, the bowel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The etiology and immunopathogenesis of both conditions characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> (CeD), are not completely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both are complex diseases with genetics and environment contributing to dysregulation of innate and adaptive immune responses, leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CeD constitutes a particular disease because the main environmental and genetic triggers are largely known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IBD comprises two main clinical forms, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, which most likely involve a complex interplay between some components of the commensal microbiota and other environmental factors in their origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These multifactorial diseases encompass a broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>ages of onset</z:hpo>, although the clinical presentation often differs depending on childhood or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo>, with greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> commonly observed in adults </plain></SENT>
