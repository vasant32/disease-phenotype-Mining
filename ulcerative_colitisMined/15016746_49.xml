<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Desulfovibrios produce <z:chebi fb="35" ids="15138">sulphide</z:chebi>, which is toxic to colonic epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These bacteria have previously been linked to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Traditional methods of culturing these organisms are slow, and often unreliable, while molecular approaches are either non-quantitative or lack sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To develop a sensitive method for quantitating desulfovibrios in stools and biopsy tissue, and to investigate the effects of age and disease on these bacteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rectal biopsies were taken from 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> patients and 10 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stool samples were obtained from 10 healthy infants (mean age 1.01 (0.18) years), 10 healthy young adults (26.7 (1.2) years), and 10 healthy elderly people (71.7 (1.2) years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primers were designed and developed for analysing Desulfovibrio populations in the bowel using real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The PCR primers were highly specific for desulfovibrios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Large numbers (approximately 10(6)-10(7)/g) occurred in biopsies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> patients and healthy subjects, and no disease related differences were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Measurements of mucosal desulfovibrios over 12 months showed marked changes in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Infants (10(6)-10(7)/g) and elderly people (10(7)-10(8)/g) had significantly higher numbers of desulfovibrios in stools compared with young adults (10(5)/g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Real time PCR analysis of desulfovibrios was an efficient and accurate method for studying these potentially harmful microorganisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Desulfovibrios were ubiquitous in the bowel, irrespective of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>As rectal mucosae were heavily colonised in health and disease, if these bacteria play a role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, some host defect, possibly in <z:chebi fb="35" ids="15138">sulphide</z:chebi> detoxication pathways or in <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> antigen handling, is required for manifestations of pathogenicity </plain></SENT>
