<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: α-Haemolysin (HlyA) influences host cell ionic homeostasis and causes concentration-dependent cell lysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, HlyA-producing Escherichia coli is capable of inducing 'focal leaks' in colon epithelia, through which bacteria and antigens translocate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study addressed the role of HlyA as a virulence factor in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> according to the 'leaky gut' concept </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: To study the action of HlyA in the colon, we performed oral administration of HlyA-expressing E coli-536 and its isogenic α-haemolysin-deficient mutant (HDM) in three mouse models: <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp>, interleukin-10 knockout mice (IL-10(-/-)) and monoassociated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiological properties of the colonised colon were characterised in Ussing experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammation</z:mp> scores were evaluated and focal leaks in the colon were assessed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HlyA quantity in human colon biopsies was measured by quantitative PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three experimental mouse models infected with HlyA-producing E coli-536 showed an increase in focal leak area compared with HDM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was associated with a decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and an increase in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="33839">macromolecule</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, inflammatory activity index was increased to a higher degree in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-prone mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mucosal samples from human colon were E coli HlyA-positive in 19 of 22 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, 9 of 9 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and 9 of 12 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, focal leaks were found together with 10-fold increased levels of HlyA in active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: E coli HlyA impairs intestinal barrier function via focal leak induction in the epithelium, thereby intensifying antigen uptake and triggering <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> in vulnerable mouse models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, HlyA-expressing E coli strains should be considered as potential cofactors in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
