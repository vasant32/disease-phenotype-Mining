<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> patients who shunt <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> metabolism towards more toxic and less desirable pathways, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi> is proving to be an effective add on therapy with good resultant disease control and less treatment side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As many such patients are young, the potential for pregnant women to be exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi> is increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The safety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi> in pregnancy is not known however </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: We report three cases of safe use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi> in pregnancy for women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This included 2 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 1 patient with fistulising <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">Allopurinol</z:chebi> was used throughout pregnancy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 pregnancies resulted in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy babies born at term by Caesarean section </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is important to evaluate and document the safety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi> during pregnancy, as it is finding new roles in young patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These three cases add significantly to the very limited data on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi> use in pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We encourage reporting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi> use in pregnant patients and suggest an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi> pregnancy registry to document drug exposures and outcomes </plain></SENT>
