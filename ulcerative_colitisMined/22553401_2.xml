<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 39 patients with mild to moderate UC defined as a Simple Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>Colitis</z:hpo> Activity Index (SCCAI) &gt; 4 and &lt; 12 (median: 7.5), who were treated open-label with Profermin(®) twice daily for 24 wk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Daily SCCAI was reported observer blinded via the Internet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In an intention to treat (ITT) analysis, the mean reduction in SCCAI score was 56.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 39 patients, 24 (62%) reached the primary endpoint, which was proportion of patients with ≥ 50% reduction in SCCAI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our secondary endpoint, the proportion of patients in remission defined as SCCAI ≤ 2.5, was in ITT analysis reached in 18 of the 39 patients (46%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a repeated-measure regression analysis, the estimated mean reduction in score was 5.0 points (95% CI: 4.1-5.9, P &lt; 0.001) and the estimated mean time taken to obtain half the reduction in score was 28 d (95% CI: 26-30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no serious adverse events (AEs) or withdrawals due to AEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Profermin(®) was generally well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Profermin(®) is safe and may be effective in inducing remission of active UC </plain></SENT>
