<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Measurements of oxygen consumption and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> production by cell suspensions indicate that they are metabolically active for at least one hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The method has been modified for the preparation of isolated epithelial cells from the human colon by including an enzyme digestion step and by increasing the concentration of EDTA to 10 mM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human colonocytes have been obtained either from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa (ascending and descending colon) or from the mucosa in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (descending colon) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Oxygen consumption of human cell suspensions is lower than in the rat but in colonocytes from both species the rate is increased by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">n-butyrate</z:chebi>, a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> constituent of the colonic lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The method yields metabolically active cell suspensions from diseased colonic mucosa and promises to be of value for biochemical studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
