<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty UC rats, induced by intestinal enema together with 2.4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34718">dinitrochlorobenzene</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34718">DNCB</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi>, were randomly divided into 3 groups, i.e., GI, GII and GIII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Groups GI and GII were administered with TCME and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9334">salazosulfapyridine</z:chebi> enema (SASPE), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group GIII was clystered with only <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline (NSE), served as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group GIV was taken from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats as reference, once daily, from the 7th day after the establishment of UC for total 28 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the colonic mucosa was assayed by (3)H-TdR incorporation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Colonic mucosal lymphocyte subpopulation adhesive molecules, CD(4)(+)CD(11a )(+), CD(4)(+)CD(18)(+), CD(8)(+)CD(11a)(+), CD(8)(+)CD1(18)(+) (LSAM), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-alpha, and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the expression of TNF-alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and IFN-gamma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in colonic mucosa were detected by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before therapies, in model groups, GI, GII and GIII, levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, CD(8)(+)CD(11a)(+) and CD(8)(+)CD(18)(+) were significantly different (38.29+/-2.61 U/mL, 16.54+/-1.23 ng/L, 8.61+/-0.89 ng/L, 13.51+/-2.31% and 12.22+/-1.13%, respectively) compared to those in GIV group (31.56+/-2.47 U/mL, 12.81+/-1.38 ng/L, 5.28+/-0.56 ng/L, 16.68+/-1.41% and 16.79+/-1.11%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After therapeutic enemas, in GI group, the contents of IL-6 (32.48+/-2.53 U/m), TNF-alpha (13.42+/-1.57 ng/L) and IFN-gamma (5.87+/-0.84 ng/L) were reduced; then, the contents of CD(8)(+)CD(11a)(+) (16.01+/-1.05 %) and CD(8)(+)CD(18)(+) (16.28+/-0.19%) were raised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between groups GI and GIV, but the difference between groups GI and GII was quite obvious (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The expressions of TNF-alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and IFN-gamma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in group GIII were much higher than those of group GIV, but those in group GI were significantly suppressed by TCME therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> is related to colonic regional mucosal inflammatory factors and immune imbalance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>TCME can effectively inhibit regional mucosal inflammatory factors and improve their disorder of immunity </plain></SENT>
