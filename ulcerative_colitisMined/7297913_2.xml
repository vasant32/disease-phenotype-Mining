<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A non-transmissible cytopathic effect was observed in cultures inoculated with material from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a blind study this cytopathic effect was observed in three specimens from three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, in six specimens from four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and six specimens from five patients with upper <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cytopathic effect is unlikely to be associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel diseases</z:e> tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results are also consistent with the failure of others to isolate a virus by the techniques used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the limited range of techniques used no evidence was obtained to implicate conventional viruses in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
