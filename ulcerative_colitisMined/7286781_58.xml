<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in remission showed a proliferative pattern similar to that seen in both regenerating and "precancerous' mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with a short history were as likely to show this pattern as those with a long history, and this shows that the abnormal pattern does not signify impending malignant change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also found that mucosa from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in remission showed an increased proportion of cells synthesising DNA, a proportion surprisingly close to that seen in an active phase; this suggests that the abnormal pattern seen in remission is the pattern of a regenerating mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We feel that this high rate of mucosal turnover, sustained not just during clinically active disease but throughout remission, leads to the increased incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and to the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in flat mucosa </plain></SENT>
