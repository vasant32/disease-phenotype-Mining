<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed changes in medical treatment and surgery over time and impact of medications on risk of surgery in a population-based cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 48 967 individuals were diagnosed with IBD (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), 13 185; <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), 35 782) during 1979-2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cumulative probability of receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acids</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>), topical, oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α (TNF-α) blockers, and of first minor or major surgery according to period of diagnosis, was estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Medication use and risk of surgery was examined by Cox regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 5-year cumulative probability of first major surgery decreased from 44.7% in cohort (1979-1986) to 19.6% in cohort (2003-2011) (p &lt; 0.001) for CD, and from 11.7% in cohort (1979-1986) to 7.5% in cohort (2003-2011) (p &lt; 0.001) for UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Minor surgery risk decreased significantly in CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From cohort (1995-2002) to cohort (2003-2011), a significant increase in use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi> and TNF-α blockers was observed, paralleled by a significant decrease in use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparing use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> (or oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>) to never-use, no convincing surgery-sparing effect was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comparing use in 3+ months of a given drug with use &lt;3 months, only 3+ months use of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> reduced the risk of surgery in patients with disease duration of &gt;1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Parallel to an increasing use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi> and TNF-α blockers in IBD over time, a persistent significant decrease in surgery rates was observed along with a significant decrease in use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, no convincing surgery-sparing effect of newer medications was found </plain></SENT>
