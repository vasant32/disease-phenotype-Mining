<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore studied seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in remission, and five with active disease to determine acetylated and free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> plasma concentrations and urinary <z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> after the administration of three different types of enemas: (2 g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>/100 ml, 4 g/100 ml, and 200 ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients in remission urinary <z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> excretion was dose and volume dependent (p less than 0.01; p less than 0.05) but this correlation was absent in active disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because aminosalicylates are usually eliminated through the kidney, these low values (10% in active disease and 19% in those in remission) suggest that the beneficial action may be local </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Urinary recovery was significantly lower in patients with active disease (p less than 0.01; p less than 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No accumulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> was found in plasma after repeated daily administration </plain></SENT>
