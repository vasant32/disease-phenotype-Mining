<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several compounds that possess antiproliferative properties and/or inhibit cytokine production exhibit a therapeutic effect in murine models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> (mTOR), a protein kinase regulating cell proliferation, is implicated in colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we report that a novel haloacyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38207">aminopyridine</z:chebi>-based molecule (P2281) is a mTOR inhibitor and is efficacious in a murine model of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies using Western blot analysis and cell-based ELISA assays showed that P2281 inhibits mTOR activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro and in vivo assays of proinflammatory cytokine production revealed that P2281 diminishes induced IFN-gamma production but not TNF-alpha production, indicating preferential inhibitory effects of P2281 on T cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34674">dextran sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (DSS) model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, 1) macroscopic colon observations demonstrated that P2281 significantly inhibited DSS-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> index, decreased disease activity index, and reversed DSS-induced shortening of the colon; 2) histological analyses of colonic tissues revealed that P2281 distinctly attenuated DSS-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, prominently diminished the <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> in the colonic mucosa, and resulted in protection against DSS-induced crypt damage; and 3) Western blot analysis showed that P2281 blocks DSS-induced activation of mTOR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these results provide direct evidence that P2281, a novel mTOR inhibitor, suppresses DSS-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> by inhibiting T cell function and is a potential therapeutic for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Given that compounds with anticancer activity show promising anti-inflammatory efficacy, our findings reinforce the cross-therapeutic functionality of potential drugs </plain></SENT>
