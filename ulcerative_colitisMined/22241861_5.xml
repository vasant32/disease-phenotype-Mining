<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Intestinal epithelial barrier disruption is a feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD), but whether barrier disruption precedes or merely accompanies <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tight junction (TJ) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> complexes control epithelial barrier integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since some TJ proteins reside in cholesterol-enriched regions of the cell membrane termed <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> rafts, we sought to elucidate the relationship between rafts and intestinal epithelial barrier function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> rafts were isolated from Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells primed with the proinflammatory cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ) or treated with <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-β-cyclodextrin as a positive control for raft disruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rafts were also isolated from the ilea of mice in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> had been induced in conjunction with in vivo intestinal permeability measurements, and lastly from intestinal biopsies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) patients with predominantly mild or quiescent disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Raft distribution was analyzed by measuring activity of the raft-associated enzyme alkaline phosphatase and by performing Western blot analysis for flotillin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Epithelial barrier integrity was estimated by measuring transepithelial resistance in cytokine-treated cells or in vivo permeability to fluorescent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> in colitic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Raft and nonraft fractions were analyzed by Western blotting for the TJ proteins occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results revealed that <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> rafts were disrupted in IFN-γ-treated cells, in the ilea of mice with subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, and in UC patients with quiescent <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was not associated with a clear pattern of occludin or ZO-1 relocalization from raft to nonraft fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significantly, a time-course study in colitic mice revealed that disruption of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> rafts preceded the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of increased intestinal permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest for the first time that <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> raft disruption occurs early in the inflammatory cascade in murine and human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and, we speculate, may contribute to subsequent disruption of epithelial barrier function </plain></SENT>
