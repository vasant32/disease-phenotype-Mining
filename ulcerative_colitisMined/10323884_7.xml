<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In patients with long standing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> at risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, mutations of the p53 and Ki-ras gene were investigated in lavage solution obtained at surveillance colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DNA was isolated from 31 consecutive patients with total or subtotal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and a disease duration of between seven and 26 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty seven control patients showed no macroscopic or microscopic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> on colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exons 5-8 of the p53 gene and exon 1 of the Ki-ras gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations of the p53 gene were detected by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Point mutations of the Ki-ras gene were hybridised on dot blots with oligonucleotides marked with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42098">digoxigenin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the 27 control patients, <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> p53 and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> Ki-ras could be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, a mutation in exon 5 to 7 of the p53 gene was found, and two patients had a mutation of the Ki-ras gene (Gly to Asp-12, Gly to Val-12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of these patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in serial biopsy specimens, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one had had the disease for more than 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One control patient had a mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mutations were more frequent in patients with long standing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (19%) than in control patients (3%, p = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The technique may be useful for screening for early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
