<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Antisecretory factor (AF), a 41 kDa cloned and sequenced protein, suppresses <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> and hypersecretion in animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endogenous AF production can be induced by dietary modifications in several animal species, and this feed has been shown to reduce the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290807" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diarrhoeal disease</z:e> in weaning piglets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The role of AF in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal disease</z:e> in humans is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To study the effects of hydrothermally processed cereals, optimised for AF induction in animals, added to the diet of patients with longstanding symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Fifty three patients with IBD (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>) were entered into the study, and 50 completed follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The experimental group consisted of 16 females (mean age 50 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> 5) years) and 10 males (41 (4) years) and the placebo group of 12 women (41 (4) years old) and 12 men (51 (5) years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were randomised to receive either hydrothermally processed cereals (active treatment) or the same amount of ordinary cereals (placebo treatment) for four weeks in a double blind study design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Baseline diet and medications remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bowel symptoms, plasma levels of AF, and colonic biopsies were evaluated before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The active treatment significantly improved subjective ratings of clinical symptoms and increased plasma AF levels compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels were unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hydrothermally processed cereals can induce AF production in human IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This increase in endogenous AF activity is associated with clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further studies are warranted to clarify the exact role of AF in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
