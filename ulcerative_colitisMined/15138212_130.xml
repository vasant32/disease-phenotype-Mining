<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several placebo controlled studies have demonstrated the efficacy of infliximab in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) but the potential toxicity of this new biological compound has been less studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the use of infliximab in IBD in a population based cohort, with special emphasis on the occurrence of severe adverse events and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with IBD treated with infliximab between 1999 and 2001 in Stockholm County were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective registration of clinical data was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Retrospective analyses were made of possible adverse events occurring in relation to infliximab treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adverse events requiring pharmacological treatment or hospitalisation were defined as severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical response was assessed as remission, response, or failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A cohort comprising 217 patients was assembled: 191 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), and infliximab was used off label for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) in 22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients were treated for indeterminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (IC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 37.6 (0.9) years (range 8-79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean number of infliximab infusions was 2.6 (0.1) (range 1-11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Forty two severe adverse events were registered in 41 patients (CD, n = 35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the severe adverse events occurred postoperatively (CD, n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Three patients with CD developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (of which two were fatal), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">opportunistic infections</z:e> occurred in two patients (one with UC, fatal), and two patients with severe attacks of IBD died due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> (one with CD, one postoperatively with UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>One additional patient with UC died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> after colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Mean age in the group with fatal outcome was 62.7 years (range 25-79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 75% and did not differ between the patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab was efficacious as an anti-inflammatory treatment when assessed in a population based cohort of patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, there appear to be a significant risk of deleterious and fatal adverse events, particularly in elderly patients with severe attacks of IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Off label use of infliximab in UC and IC should be avoided until efficacy is proven in randomised controlled trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The underlying risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> among patients with severe or chronically active CD in need of infliximab treatment is not known but the finding of a 1.5% annual incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> emphasises the need for vigilant surveillance with respect to this malignant complication </plain></SENT>
