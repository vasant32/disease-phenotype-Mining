<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The enteric glia network may be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Enteric glia cells (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EGCs</z:e>) are the major source of glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), which regulates <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of enterocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to determine the distribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EGCs</z:e> and GDNF during gut <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and to elucidate a possible diminished enteric glia network in IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in colonic biopsies of patients with IBD, controls and patients with infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> was detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue GDNF levels were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expression of GFAP and GDNF in the mucosal plexus is highly increased in the inflamed colon of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the GDNF and GFAP content are increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), it is significantly less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally the non-inflamed colon of CD patients showed a reduced GFAP and no GDNF expression compared to controls and the non-inflamed colon of UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: GFAP and GDNF as signs of activated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EGCs</z:e> are increased in the inflamed mucosa of patients with UC and infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, which underline an unspecific role of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EGC</z:e> in the regulation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reduced GFAP and GDNF content in the colon of CD patients suggest a diminished <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EGC</z:e> network in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This might be a part of the pathophysiological puzzle of CD </plain></SENT>
