<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Epithelial barrier function is impaired in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To define the underlying cellular mechanisms with special attention to tight junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Biopsy specimens from the sigmoid colon of patients with mild to moderately active or inactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> were studied in Ussing chambers, and barrier function was determined by impedance analysis and conductance scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tight junction structure was analysed by freeze fracture electron microscopy, and tight junction proteins were investigated immunohistochemically by confocal laser scanning microscopy and quantified in immunoblots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Epithelial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was analysed in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> nick-end labelling and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51231">4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> showed an impaired intestinal barrier function as indicated by a distinct reduction in epithelial resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As distribution of conductivity was even, focal epithelial lesions (eg, microerosions) did not contribute to barrier dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Instead, freeze fracture electron microscopy analysis showed reduced and discontinuous tight junction strands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Occludin and the sealing tight junction proteins claudin 5 and claudin 8 were downregulated and redistributed off the tight junction, whereas the pore-forming tight junctions protein claudin 2 was strongly upregulated, which constitute the molecular basis of tight junction changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other claudins were unchanged (claudins 1, 4 and 7) or not detectable in sigmoid colon (claudins 11, 12, 14, 15 and 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Claudin 2 upregulation was less pronounced in active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> compared with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and was inducible by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As a second source of impaired barrier function, epithelial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was distinctly increased in active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (mean (SD) 5.2 (0.5)% v 1.9 (0.2)% in control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>By contrast, barrier function, tight junction proteins and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were unaffected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Upregulation of pore-forming claudin 2 and downregulation and redistribution of sealing claudins 5 and 8 lead to altered tight junction structure and pronounced barrier dysfunction already in mild to moderately active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
