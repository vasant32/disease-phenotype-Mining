<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 102 UC patients (53 Han patients including 22 men and 31 women, and 49 Uyghur patients including 25 men and 24 women; aged 48 ± 16 years) and 310 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled from January 2010 to May 2011 in Xinjiang People's Hospital of China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>UC was diagnosed based on the clinical, endoscopic and histological findings following Lennard-Jones criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were collected and genomic DNA was extracted by the routine laboratory methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction-sequence-based typing method was used to identify FUT2 variants rs281377, rs1047781, rs601338 and rs602662 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genotypic and allelic frequencies were documented and compared between the UC patients and the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genotypic frequencies were also compared between Han and Uyghur patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Potential association of genetic variation and UC between Han and Uyghur patients was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: rs281377 was found significantly associated with UC in the Han population as compared with the controls (P = 0.011) while rs281377 was not associated with UC in the Uyghur population (P = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TT homozygous rs281377 frequencies were higher in the UC groups than in the controls (88.7% vs 68.7% and 55.1% vs 50.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>rs1047781 was specifically associated with UC in the Uyghur population (P = 0.001), but not associated with UC in the Han population (P = 0.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TT homozygous rs1047781 frequencies were lower in the UC groups than in the controls (9.5% vs 11.8% and 4.0% vs 6.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>rs601338 was statistically related to UC in both populations (Han, P = 0.025; Uyghur, P = 8.33 × 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>AA homozygous rs601338 frequencies were lower in the UC groups than in the controls (0% vs 1.8% and 12.2% vs 13.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No association was found between rs602662 and UC in both Han and the Uyghur populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Allelic analysis showed that rs281377 allele was significantly associated with UC in the Han population as compared with the controls [P = 0.001, odd ratio (OR) = 0.26], however, it was not associated with UC in the Uyghur population (P = 0.603, OR = 1.14), and rs1047781 allele was associated with UC in the Uyghur population (P = 0.001, OR = 0.029) while it was not associated with UC in the Han population (P = 0.074, OR = 0.62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Moreover, rs601338 was associated with UC in both Han (P = 0.005, OR = 0.1) and Uyghur populations (P = 0.002, OR = 0.43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Meta analysis showed that rs1047781 and rs601338 conferred risk of UC as compared with the controls [P = 0.005, OR = 0.47; P = 0.0003, OR = 0.35; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.31-0.72 and 0.21-0.58], but rs281377 and rs602662 showed no statistically significant differences between patients with UC and controls (P = 0.10, OR = 0.71; P = 0.68, OR = 0.09; 95% CI = 0.47-1.07 and 0.56-1.47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Functionally relevant FUT2 gene variants are associated with UC, suggesting that they play a potential role in the pathogenesis of UC and may contribute to the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of UC between Han and Uyghur patients </plain></SENT>
