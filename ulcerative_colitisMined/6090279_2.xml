<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ileostomy effluent in five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and five with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> after two weeks on a diet rich in <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> and refined cereal has been compared with the same period on a diet low in <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> and rich in unrefined cereal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Observations were made hourly for nine hours after equicaloric breakfasts representing the two diets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The amount of ileostomy effluent was greater on the unrefined carbohydrate diet both in terms of wet weight (238 +/- 89 g vs 162 +/- 79 g, p less than 0.02) and dry weight (23 X 6 +/- 6.8 g vs 14.9 +/- 6.6 g, p less than 0.01); surprisingly, the amount of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharide</z:chebi> was also greater (169 +/- 41 mg vs 82 +/- 26 mg, p less than 0.001) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The bacteriological flora per gram was also higher on the unrefined carbohydrate diet after the test meal (p less than 0.02 between three and six hours) as a result of a general increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> organisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relative proportions of the organisms did not vary between the two diets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences were detected between patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
