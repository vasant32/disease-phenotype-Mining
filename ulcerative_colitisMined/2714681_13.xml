<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We used enzyme (acid phosphatase [AP]) and immunohistochemical techniques and a set of monoclonal antibodies (CD11, CD5, CD4, CD19, CD8, OKIa), including two recently developed antibodies--for example, HECA-452 (specific for an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule on high endothelial venules) and RFD1 (specific for 'active' human dendritic cells) to analyse the composition of the gut wall infiltrate of 10 well defined cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (CIBD) (six <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), four <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two polar forms in a spectrum of gut mononuclear phagocyte types (CD11+) were identified: at the one extreme scavenger macrophages with blunted projections (AP+, Heca-452-, RFD1-) and at the other extreme, dendritic cells with long dendritic cytoplasmic projections (AP-, Heca-452+, RFD1+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dendritic cells were mainly found in highly organised lymphoid tissue present at the deeper layers in the gut wall (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gut: underneath the muscularis mucosae and T-cell areas of lymph follicles [25-30 per follicle]; surrounding the broad zone of scavenger macrophages at the bottom of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> (CIBD) and fissures (CD) and in the lymphoid aggregates [25-30 dendritic cells per aggregate] adjacent to granulomas (CD] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These observations can be taken as evidence that exaggerated antigen handling and presentation and stimulation of the immune response takes place at these foci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The observation that scavenger macrophages were localised more superficial, as band like zones (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gut: subepithelial; mainly surrounding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> (CIBD) and fissures (CD] can be taken as evidence that at these spots the ingestion and degradation of foreign material takes place </plain></SENT>
