<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 2002 to March 2011, fourty-five patients underwent ileal pouch anal anastomosis with modified double-stapled mucosectomy technique and the clinical data obtained for these patients were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (n = 29) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">familial adenomatous polyposis</z:e> (n = 16) underwent ileal pouch-anal anastomosis with modified double-stapled mucosectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients underwent one-stage restorative proctocolectomy, ileal pouch anal anastomosis, protective ileostomy and the ileostomy was closed 4-12 mo postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two-stage procedures were performed in seventeen urgent patients, proctectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis were completed after previous colectomy with ileostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Morbidity within the first 30 d of surgery occurred in 10 (22.2%) patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them could be treated conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the median follow-up of 65 mo, mild to moderate anastomotic narrowing was occurred in 4 patients, one patient developed persistent anastomotic stricture and need surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five percent of patients developed at least 1 episode of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">incontinence</z:e> in our patients, the median functional Oresland score was 6, 3 and 2 after 1 year, 2.5 years and 5 years respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nearly half patients (44.4%) reported "moderate functioning", 37.7% reported "good functioning", whereas in 17.7% of patients "poor functioning" was observed after 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five years later, 79.2% of patients with good function, 16.7% with moderate function, only 4.2% of patients with poor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of ileal pouch anal anastomosis with modified double-stapled mucosectomy technique are promising, with a low complication rate and good long-term functional results </plain></SENT>
