<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the expression of endothelial and inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthases (eNOS and iNOS) and their role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the effect of sera obtained from patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) on the function and viability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HUVECs were cultured for 0-48 h in the presence of a medium containing pooled serum of healthy controls, or serum from patients with active CD or UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of eNOS and iNOS was visualized by immunofluorescence, and quantified by the densitometry of Western blots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proliferation activity was assessed by computerized image analyses of Ki-67 immunoreactive cells, and also tested in the presence of the NOS inhibitor, 10(-4) mol/L L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was examined by the annexin-V-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> method and by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> staining, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In HUVEC immediately after exposure to UC, serum eNOS was markedly induced, reaching a peak at 12 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a decrease in eNOS was observed after incubation with CD sera and the eNOS level was minimal at 20 h compared to control (18%+/-16% vs 23%+/-15% P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>UC or CD serum caused a significant increase in iNOS compared to control (UC: 300%+/-21%; CD: 275%+/-27% vs 108%+/-14%, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath>/<z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> characteristics did not differ significantly in either experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increased proliferation activity was detected in the presence of CD serum or after treatment with L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cultures showed tube-like formations after 24 h treatment with CD serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IBD sera evoked changes in the ratio of eNOS/iNOS, whereas did not influence the viability of HUVEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These involved down-regulation of eNOS and up-regulation of iNOS simultaneously, leading to increased proliferation activity and possibly a reduced anti-inflammatory protection of endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
