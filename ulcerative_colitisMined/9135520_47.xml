<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The incidence figures for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) have been difficult to interpret, and geographical variations may be due to differences in classification criteria and study design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few studies have based the incidence on prospective systematic follow up to confirm the initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1990 and 1993, in a prospective incidence study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) in south eastern Norway, 527 cases of UC, 228 cases of CD, 36 cases of indeterminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (IND), and 55 cases of possible IBD were identified, yielding an annual incidence of 13.6, 5.9, 0.9, and 1.4 per 10(5) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinical data were reviewed by two gastroenterologists independently of each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One to two years after diagnosis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were offered a clinical follow up in which the initial diagnosis was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between the time of diagnosis and the follow up, 16 patients had died, four of complications related to IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 830 patients, 98% (814/830) were available for follow up, 93% (772/830) attended a clinical examination which included a colonoscopy in 77% (637/830), and the remainder had had a telephone interview, or reassessment based on hospital records, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty seven patients were reclassified as not having IBD (3%), and 65 patients were characterised as possible IBD (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the patients initially classified as UC, 88% had their diagnosis confirmed, compared with 91% with an initial diagnosis of CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with indeterminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, 33% were classified as definite UC and 17% as CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This reclassification of patients yielded a corrected annual incidence of 12.8 for UC and 6.0 for CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: At follow up one to two years after the diagnosis of IBD, the initial incidence was only marginally altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This is probably due to uniform inclusion criteria and careful diagnostic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The study also illustrates the importance of the re-evaluation of the initial diagnosis as close to 10%, both among patients with UC and CD, were reclassified at follow up </plain></SENT>
