<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three weeks of treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> or 4-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> (50 micrograms/kg) and one week of treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> significantly decreased colonic interleukin-1 generation and the extent and severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48110">trinitrobenzene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29214">sulphonic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Colonic biopsies were obtained from patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and organ cultured 24 hours in the absence or presence of the following drugs: sulphasalazine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="132842">sulphapyridine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> and 4-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> (25-100 micrograms/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-1 content in tissue cultured in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> (100 micrograms/ml) was two-thirds of its content in tissue cultured in drug free medium and its release into the medium was decreased by 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sulphasalazine 50 micrograms/ml significantly decreased by 33% the tissue content but did not affect interleukin-1 release and a higher dose was not more effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="132842">Sulphapyridine</z:chebi> and 4-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> in doses up to 100 micrograms/ml did not affect either interleukin-1 colonic content or its release into the culture medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that pharmacological suppression of colonic interleukin-1 generation may be one, although not the sole mechanism to explain the therapeutic efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
