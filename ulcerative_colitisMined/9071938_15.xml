<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Novel monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were used in this study to investigate regional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MAbs generated using a method of tolerisation against common antigens in the proximal colon and distal colon were used for immunoperoxidase staining, comparative histochemistry, immunoblotting, and slot-blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The colon specific MAbs 5F1 (IgG3) and 6G4 (IgM) stained goblet cell contents throughout the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> distal colon but staining was markedly reduced in the proximal colon (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the distal colon of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, whether quiescent or actively inflamed, reactivity was reduced compared with controls (p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.001 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast, an overall increase in staining was seen in the uninflamed proximal colon in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> compared with controls (p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparative staining with high iron <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15571,23666">diamine</z:chebi> and biochemical analyses indicated that MAb 6G4 was reactive with mucin bearing <z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> or O-acetylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> groups, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Regional differences in the staining characteristics of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucin have been shown using novel monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pattern of mucin expression throughout the colon in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> is altered even in the absence of histological changes </plain></SENT>
