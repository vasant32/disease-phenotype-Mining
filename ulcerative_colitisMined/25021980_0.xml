<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To compare 3-year mortality, and factors related to mortality, in Scottish patients hospitalised with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) between Period 1 (1998-2000) and Period 2 (2007-2009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Scottish Morbidity Records and linked datasets were used to assess 3-year crude mortality, standardised mortality ratio (SMR) and multivariate analyses of factors associated with 3-year mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 3-year mortality was determined after four admission types: surgery-elective or emergency; medical-elective or emergency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age-standardised mortality rates (ASR) were used to compare mortality rates between periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The admission rate with UC increased from 10.6 per 100,000 of the Scottish population per year in Period 1 to 11.6 in Period 2 (p = 0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among those admitted with UC, the proportion aged &lt;30yrs increased (p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Crude and adjusted 3-year mortality fell between time periods (Crude 12.2% [Period 1] to 8.3% [Period 2], adjusted OR 0.59, CI 0.42 to 0.81, p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following emergency medical admission, 3-year mortality was reduced in Period 2 (OR 0.58, p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Within the &gt;65 yrs age group crude 3-year mortality fell (38.8% to 28.7%, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall SMR in period 1 was 3.04 and 2.96 in Period 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Directly age standardised mortality decreased from 373 (CI 309-437) to 264 (CI 212-316) per 10,000 person years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, older age and co-morbid remained associated with 3-year mortality in Period 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the mortality associated with admission remains high at 3 years, crude and adjusted rates suggest significant reductions over the last decade </plain></SENT>
