<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) has been implicated as an important mediator of stress-induced abnormalities in intestinal mucosal function in animal models, but to date no studies in human colon have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim was to examine the effects of CRH on mucosal barrier function in the human colon and to elucidate the mechanisms involved in CRH-induced hyper-permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Biopsies from 39 volunteers were assessed for macromolecular permeability (horseradish peroxidase (HRP), (51)Cr-EDTA), and electrophysiology after CRH challenge in Ussing chambers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The biopsies were examined by electron and confocal microscopy for HRP and CRH receptor localisation, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, CRH receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression were examined in the human mast cell line, HMC-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mucosal permeability to HRP was increased by CRH (2.8+/-0.5 pmol/cm(2)/h) compared to vehicle exposure (1.5+/-0.4 pmol/cm(2)/h), p = 0.032, whereas permeability to (51)Cr-EDTA and transmucosal electrical resistance were unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increased permeability to HRP was abolished by alpha-helical CRH (9-41) (1.3+/-0.6 pmol/cm(2)/h) and the mast cell stabilizer, lodoxamide (1.6+/-0.6 pmol/cm(2)/h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy showed transcellular passage of HRP through colonocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CRH receptor subtypes R1 and R2 were detected in the HMC-1 cell line and in lamina propria mast cells in human colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that CRH mediates transcellular uptake of HRP in human colonic mucosa via CRH receptor subtypes R1 and R2 on subepithelial mast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CRH-induced macromolecular uptake in human colon mucosa may have implications for stress-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
