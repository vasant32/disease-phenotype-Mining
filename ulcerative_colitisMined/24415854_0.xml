<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations within the HNF4A gene are associated with human diseases such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>maturity-onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, HNF4A has also been described as a susceptibility gene for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in genome-wide association studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, specific HNF4A genetic variants have been identified in pediatric cohorts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results obtained from knockout mice supported that HNF4-α can protect the intestinal mucosae against <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the exact molecular links behind HNF4-α and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> remains elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this review, we will summarize the current knowledge about the role of HNF4-α and its isoforms in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specific nature of HNF4-α P1 and P2 classes of isoforms will be summarized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HNF4-α role as a hepatocyte mediator for cytokines relays during <z:mp ids='MP_0001860'>liver inflammation</z:mp> will be integrated based on documented examples of the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions that can be made from these earlier liver studies will serve as a basis to extrapolate correlations and divergences applicable to <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, potential functional roles for HNF4-α isoforms in protecting the intestinal mucosae from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and pathological <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> will be presented </plain></SENT>
