<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two patients with UC and 24 with CD were monitored during steroid treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rectal NO levels were measured and clinical activities were assessed on days 1, 3, 7 and 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mucosal presence of NOS and pro-inflammatory cytokines were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Active UC and CD displayed markedly increased rectal NO levels (10950 +/- 7610 and 5040 +/- 1280 parts per billion (ppb), respectively) as compared with the controls (154 +/- 71 ppb, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rectal NO correlated weakly with disease activity in both UC and CD (r = 0.34 for UC and r = 0.48 for CD, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 12 patients, a steroid-refractory course led to colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These patients had only slightly increased NO levels (UC: 620 +/- 270 ppb; CD: 1260 +/- 550 ppb) compared to those with a therapeutic response (UC: 18860 +/- 530 ppb, P &lt; 0.001; CD: 10060 +/- 3200 ppb, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Rectal NO level is a useful biomarker of treatment response in IBD as low NO levels predicts a poor clinical response to steroid treatment </plain></SENT>
