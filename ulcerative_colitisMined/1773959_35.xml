<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients had extensive or total <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 36 left sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median duration of the disease at the end of the follow up was 15.0 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Altogether 182 colonoscopies (2.8 per patient), each involving approximately 20 biopsies from different sites of the colon, were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the total or extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> group, five patients had low grade and one patient had high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the left sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> group, three patients had low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In three patients low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was detected in a macroscopic lesion or mass of colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixty per cent of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> specimens were from the right colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was higher in patients with extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and increased with the duration of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the patients have so far developed colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that a colonoscopic surveillance programme is a safe alternative to prophylactic colectomy in longstanding <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
