<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the clinical outcomes and prognostic factors after intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> following oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> failure in active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> who had been treated with a course of intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> after oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy failure between January 1996 and July 2010 were recruited at Severance Hospital, Seoul, South Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The disease activity was measured by the Mayo score, which consists of stool frequency, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo>, mucosal appearance at flexible sigmoidoscopy, and Physician Global Assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively evaluated clinical outcomes at two weeks, one month, three months, and one year after the initiation of intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two weeks outcomes were classified as responders or non-responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One month, three month and one year outcomes were classified into prolonged response, steroid dependency, and refractoriness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our study included a total of 67 eligible patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At two weeks, 56 (83.6%) patients responded to intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At one month, complete remission was documented in 18 (32.1%) patients and partial remission in 26 (46.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (19.7%) were refractory to the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At three months and one year, we found 37 (67.3%) and 25 (46.3%) patients in prolonged response, ten (18.2%) and 23 (42.6%) patients in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> dependency, 8 (14.5%) and 6 (11.1%) patients with no response, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Total 9 patients were underwent elective proctocolectomy within 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The duration of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy (&gt; 14 d vs ≤ 14 d, P = 0.049) and lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level (≤ 11.0 mg/dL vs &gt;11.0 mg/dL, P = 0.02) were found to be poor prognostic factors for response at two weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For one year outcome, univariate analysis revealed that only a partial Mayo score (≥ 6 vs &lt;6, P = 0.057) was found to be associated with a poor response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The duration of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy and lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level were strongly associated with poor outcome </plain></SENT>
