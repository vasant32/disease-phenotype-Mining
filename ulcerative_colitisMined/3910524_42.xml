<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although there was no significant overall difference in outcome between the two groups, there was a trend towards a reduction in the need for operative intervention in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28001">vancomycin</z:chebi> compared with controls </plain></SENT>
