<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is a general lack of information on the care of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) in a broad, geographically diverse, non-clinic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purposes of this study were (1) to compare a sample drawn from the membership of a national Crohn's and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>Colitis</z:hpo> Foundation to published clinic-based and population-based IBD samples, (2) to describe current patterns of health care use, and (3) to determine if unexpected variations exist in how and by whom IBD is treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mailed survey of 4453 members of the Crohn's and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>Colitis</z:hpo> Foundation of Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The questionnaire, in members stated language of preference, included items on demographic and disease characteristics, general health behaviors and current and past IBD treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each member received an initial and one reminder mailing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Questionnaires were returned by 1787, 913, and 128 people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and indeterminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At least one operation had been performed on 1159 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients, with risk increasing with duration of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regional variation in surgical rates in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="50667">6-mercaptopurine</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> was used by 24% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and 12% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (95% CI for the difference: 8.9%-15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, use was not associated with gender, income or region of residence but was associated with age and markers of disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Infliximab was used by 112 respondents (4%), the majority of whom had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Variations in infliximab use based on region of residence and income were not seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sixty-eight percent of respondents indicated that they depended most on a gastroenterologist for their IBD care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was significant regional variation in this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, satisfaction with primary physician did not depend on physician type (for example, gastroenterologist versus general practitioner) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study achieved the goal of obtaining a large, geographically diverse sample that is more representative of the general IBD population than a clinic sample would have been </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We could find no evidence of significant regional variation in medical treatments due to gender, region of residence or income level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Differences were noted between different age groups, which deserves further attention </plain></SENT>
