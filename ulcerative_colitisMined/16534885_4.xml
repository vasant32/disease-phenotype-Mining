<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the efficacy of intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> pulse therapy for refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included in our cohort eight patients with (moderate/severe) steroid refractory IBD (4 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 4 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> received 6 cycles of intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (800 mg) per month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients entered into remission after the second/third <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> pulse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disease activity decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no side effects and toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients went into long lasting remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients and 3 of 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients achieved complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> showed an impressive clinical response but did not enter into remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For the maintenance, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (15 mg/wk) and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> were treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> (2.5 mg/kg body weight/d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Remission was maintained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients for 6 mo on the average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The drug was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that aggressive immunosuppressive therapy may be useful in some refractory patients and further controlled study should be considered in order to fully evaluate this type of treatment as a potential therapy for IBD </plain></SENT>
