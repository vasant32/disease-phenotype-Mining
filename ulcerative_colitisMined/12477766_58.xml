<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: In this study we investigated transmitter co-localisation in myenteric neurones of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon and the colon of patients with UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">Choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase (ChAT), neurone specific enolase (NSE), vasoactive intestinal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (VIP), and substance P (SP) were detected by immunohistochemical methods in whole mounts of colonic myenteric plexus of UC patients (n=10) and controls (n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proportion of ChAT positive and VIP positive neurones relative to the NSE population did not differ in inflamed (33.3% and 9.3%, respectively) and non-inflamed segments (33.6% and 9.7%) of UC colon compared with controls (35.0% and 6.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of SP positive neurones was significantly larger in both inflamed (15.5%) and non-inflamed (20.3%) segments than in controls (5.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of changes in subpopulations showed that 26.9% of neurones were only ChAT positive in controls but that the proportion was significantly smaller in inflamed (18.8%) and non-inflamed (15.8%) areas of UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportions of neurones containing ChAT and SP were significantly higher in inflamed (11.8%) and non-inflamed (13.9%) areas than in controls (5.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Remodelling of myenteric neurones in UC involves a shift from mainly cholinergic to more SP positive innervation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This effect may constitute part of the neuronal basis for the motility disturbances observed in UC </plain></SENT>
