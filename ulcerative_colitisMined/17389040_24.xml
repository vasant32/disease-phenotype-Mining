<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is consistent evidence that 50% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, steroid-resistant flare of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) may achieve remission and avoid colectomy if treated with cyclosporin (CsA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, follow-up of the responders has shown that most of them relapse and need surgery shortly after the response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the records of our CsA-treated patients with those of other groups in order to help clarify this matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients admitted consecutively to our Unit with an attack of UC and treated with CsA between January 1991 and December 1999 were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were begun on continuously-infused CsA at 2 mg/kg/day (1991-1996), or on NEORAL at an initial dose of 5 mg/kg/day (1996-1999) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The maintenance treatment included oral CsA for 3-6 months with or without <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> (AZA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CsA failure was defined as a relapse requiring steroids with or without progression to colectomy; the cumulative probability of relapse/colectomy was assessed by Fisher's exact tests and Kaplan-Meier analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the patients, 39/61 (63%) initially responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These 39 included a fatality and 4 drop-outs (unrelated to the side-effects of CsA), leaving 34 patients for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these, 61% and 35% were colectomy-free at 1 and 7 years, respectively; the corresponding figures were 80 and 60% respectively in the subset treated with AZA, but 47% and 15% in the AZA-untreated subgroup (p= 0.0007 at 7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the 34 patients, 44% were relapse-free at 1 year, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had relapsed at 7 years (p = 0.0635) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall resort to colectomy was 72%, while 19% of the patients remained colectomy-free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Sixty percent of a cohort of patients with steroid-refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> responded to CsA and 60% of these responders retained the colon after 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These figures fell to 35% at 7 years but improved to 60% on AZA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The overall need for colectomy remains high in these patients and toxicity must be monitored </plain></SENT>
