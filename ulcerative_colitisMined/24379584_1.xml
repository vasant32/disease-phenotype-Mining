<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analysed the interleukin-10 (IL10) receptor genes at the DNA and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> level in the proband and his relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Beta catenin and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α (TNFα) receptors were analysed in the proteins extracted from peripheral blood cells of the proband, his relatives and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">familial adenomatous polyposis</z:e> (FAP) and PTEN <z:hpo ids='HP_0010566'>hamartoma</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> syndrome (PHTS) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Samples were also collected from the proband's inflamed colorectal mucosa and compared to healthy and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> mucosa collected from a FAP patient and patients affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, we examined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> effects on primary fibroblasts stabilised from UC and FAP patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our patient was a compound heterozygote for the IL10RB E47K polymorphism, inherited from his father, and for a novel point mutation within the IL10RA promoter (the -413G-&gt;T), inherited from his mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Beta catenin and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor α receptors-I (TNFRI) protein were both over-expressed in peripheral blood cells of the proband's relatives more than the proband </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, TNFRII was over-expressed only in the proband </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, both TNFα-receptors were shown to be under-expressed in the inflamed colon mucosa and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissue compared to healthy colon mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this observation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> induced, in primary fibroblasts, IL10RB and TNFRII over-expression and TNFRI and TNFα under-expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We suggest that β-catenin and TNFRI protein expression in peripheral blood cells could represent molecular markers of sub-clinical disease in apparently healthy relatives of patients with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A synergistic effect of several variant alleles of the IL10 receptor genes, inherited in a Mendelian manner, is involved in UC <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in this young child </plain></SENT>
