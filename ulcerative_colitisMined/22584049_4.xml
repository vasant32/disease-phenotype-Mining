<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A prospective study was performed to compare the prevalence of morphometric vertebral fractures (MVF) between patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) and healthy subjects and to identify predictive factors of fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 107 patients with IBD (53 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and 54 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>) and 51 healthy subjects participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Information about anthropometric parameters, toxins, previous fractures, and parameters related to this disease were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The index of vertebral deformity, bone mass density (BMD), and biochemical parameters were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 72 fractures were detected in 38.32% of patients with IBD, and 10 fractures were detected in 13.73% of healthy subjects; the risk of fracture in patients with IBD was higher than that in control subjects (OR, 4.03; 95% CI, 1.652-9.847; p &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found no correlation between fracture and BMD in patients with IBD (lumbar spine, r = -0.103, p = 0.17 and femoral neck, r = -0.138, p = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">Corticosteroid</z:chebi> treatment was not associated with prevalent vertebral fractures nor with taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> (r = 0.135, p = 0.14) or the duration for which they were taken (r = 0.08, p = 0.38), whereas this relationship was present in the controls (r = -0.365, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, none of the measured parameters were significantly predictive of fracture, only to manifested IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510471" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hypovitaminosis</z:e> D was observed in 55.14% of patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of morphometric vertebral fractures is higher in patients with IBD than in the healthy population, without association with BMD or corticoid treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Simply having IBD was proven to be a predictive factor of fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We observed a high incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510471" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypovitaminosis</z:e> D in patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
