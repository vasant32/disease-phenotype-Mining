<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In recent decades, the prominent role of endoscopy in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) has been translated into the concept of mucosal healing (MH) as a fundamental therapeutic end-point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is partially the consequence of growing evidence of a positive prognostic role of MH on the disease course and partially due to market cues indicating a higher rate of MH in patients treated by novel potent biologic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present review is to clarify the current knowledge of MH in UC, analyzing the definition, the putative prognostic role and the association of MH with the current drugs used to treat UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because solid data about the management of UC patients based solely on the healing of the mucosa are not yet available, a tailored approach for individual patients thatconsiders the natural history of UC and the presence of prognostic indicators of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive disease</z:e> is desirable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consequently, unnecessary examinations and treatment would be avoided and restricted to UC patients who require the maximum amount of effort to affect the disease course in the short and long term </plain></SENT>
