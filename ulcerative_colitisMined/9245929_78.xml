<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nutrition may be one of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the pre-illness diet in patients with recent IBD in comparison with matched population and clinic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Quantified dietary histories were obtained from 87 patients with recent IBD (54 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and 33 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD)) and 144 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (OR) for IBD were derived for intake levels of various foods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A high <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> consumption was associated with an increased risk for IBD (OR 2.85 (p = 0.03) against population controls and 5.3 (p = 0.00) against clinic controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="17716">Lactose</z:chebi> consumption showed no effect while <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> intake was negatively associated with risk for IBD (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar trends were noted in UC and CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A high fat intake was associated with an increased risk for UC; this was particularly marked for animal fat (OR 4.09, p = 0.02) and cholesterol (OR 4.57, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A high intake of fluids (p = 0.04), <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> (p = 0.04), <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi>, and fruits (NS) was negatively associated with the risk for IBD, while a positive association was found for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most of the findings were similar in UC and CD except for <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> and vegetable consumption which showed a negative association only with risk for CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An association was found between pre-illness diet and subsequent development of UC and CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The effect of dietary components may be primary or modulatory </plain></SENT>
