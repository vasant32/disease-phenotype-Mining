<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured the content of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase and metallothionein (two endogenous copper and zinc containing proteins involved in radical scavenging) in intestinal resection specimens from 29 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and 12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and compared the concentrations with those obtained in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa of a control group of 18 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase content was similar in control mucosa and non-inflamed mucosa from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (mean (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) 2.13 (0.10) and 2.24 (0.10) mg/g protein, respectively) but was decreased in inflamed mucosa (1.87 (0.08) mg/g protein, p less than 0.005 v non-inflamed mucosa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The metallothionein content was decreased in non-inflamed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> mucosa compared with control mucosa (0.23 (0.03) and 0.36 (0.04) mg/g protein, respectively, p less than 0.02) and a further decrease was found in inflamed mucosa (0.17 (0.02) mg/g protein, p less than 0.001 v control mucosa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No differences were found between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and no significant effect of medication or tissue localisation was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings might indicate a decreased endogenous intestinal protection against oxygen derived radicals in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> which could contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease </plain></SENT>
