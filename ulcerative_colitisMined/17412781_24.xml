<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: Urocortin II (UcnII) is a neuropeptide that binds with high affinity to the corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 2 (CRHR2) in peripheral tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>UcnII is synthesised in the intestine, but its role in human <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> is largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Responses of human colonic epithelial cells expressing CRHR2 to stimulation by UcnII were measured using ELISA, western blot analysis, real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and interleukin (IL)8 promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression levels of CRHR2 and UcnII in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> were determined by immunofluorescence and real-time RT-PCR in mucosal biopsies from patients with Crohn's and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and in human intestinal xenografts after exposure to Clostridium difficile toxin A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: It is reported here that expression of CRHR2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein in human colonic epithelial cells (HT-29) are increased by exposure to C difficile toxin A or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of non-transformed NCM460 colonocytes overexpressing CRHR2alpha receptor with UcnII resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent increase in IL8 production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>UcnII stimulation also led to activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-acivated protein (MAP) kinase in these cells, as evidenced by degradation of IkappaBalpha and phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB and extracellularly regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, expression of UcnII and CRHR2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was increased in mucosal samples of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, and after exposure of human intestinal xenografts to C difficile toxin A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that UcnII has pro-inflammatory effects in human intestinal cells via the CRHR2alpha receptor and may play an important role in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in humans </plain></SENT>
