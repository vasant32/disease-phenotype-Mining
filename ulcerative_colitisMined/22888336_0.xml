<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is a pressing need for research that will lead to the reveal of targets designed to analyse the possible pathways for the treatment of IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the probable involvement of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> in inflammatory conditions of intestine and the important role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5HT</z:chebi>(4) receptors in GI function, the investigation of the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5HT</z:chebi>(4) receptors in the pathogenesis of IBD will be interesting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of cisapride, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5HT</z:chebi>(4) receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063">trinitrobenzenesulfonic-acid</z:chebi>-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi>) induced rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hours subsequent to induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi> in rats, cisapride (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p); 4 mg/kg, orally (p.o)) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (1 mg/kg, i.p; 2 mg/kg, p.o) were administrated for 6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were thereafter euthanized; macroscopic, histological, and biochemical assessments and ELISA test were carried out on distal colon samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> treatment (i.p, p.o) significantly decreased macroscopic and microscopic damage and also biochemical markers, but there were no significant differences in aforementioned parameters between cisapride (i.p or p.o) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi>-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It can be deduced that because the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> produced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi> is massive (through various pathways), cisapride could not bring about more <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> damages through <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5HT</z:chebi>(4) receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on the present study further researches are required for investigating the exact roles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5HT</z:chebi>(4) receptors in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
