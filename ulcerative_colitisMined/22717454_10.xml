<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This randomised phase I study evaluated the safety and pharmacology of etrolizumab in patients with moderate to severe UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: In the single ascending dose (SAD) stage, etrolizumab (0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 10 mg/kg intravenous, 3.0 mg/kg subcutaneous (SC) or placebo) was administered 4:1 (n=25) in each cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the multiple dose (MD) stage, new patients received monthly etrolizumab (0.5 mg/kg SC (n=4), 1.5 mg/kg SC (n=5), 3.0 mg/kg SC (n=4), 4.0 mg/kg intravenous (n=5)) or placebo (n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pharmacokinetics was studied and Mayo Clinic Score evaluated at baseline, day 29 (SAD), and days 43 and 71 (MD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the SAD stage, there were no dose limiting toxicities, infusion or injection site reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two <z:mp ids='MP_0001792'>impaired wound healing</z:mp> serious adverse events occurred in two patients receiving etrolizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the MD stage, there were no dose limiting toxicities, and no infusion or injection site reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> was the most common adverse event, occurring more often in etrolizumab patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Antietrolizumab antibodies were detected in two subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The duration of β7 receptor full occupancy was dose related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A clinical response was observed in 12/18 patients, and clinical remission in 3/18 patients treated with etrolizumab in the MD stage, compared with 4/5 and 1/5 placebo patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Etrolizumab is well tolerated in moderate to severe UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further investigation is warranted </plain></SENT>
