<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 14 patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> involving the terminal ileum, the mean (+/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) peak response in the cholylglycine (0.4 +/- 0.04 mumol/l, n = 14) as well as in the total serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> concentration (2.0 +/- 0.4 mumol/l, n = 10) was similar to that seen in a group of children who had undergone ileal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A significantly greater increase in the cholylglycine (1.8 +/- 0.18 mumol/l, n = 16, P less than 0.01) and in the total serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> concentration (9.8 +/- 2.4 mumol/l, n = 11, P less than 0.025) was noted in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In five of the six remaining patients (three with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> shown not to involve the ileum and two of three with asymptomatic, treated Crohn's <z:mp ids='MP_0009482'>ileitis</z:mp>) and in seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, the meal stimulated responses were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These preliminary results suggest that measurement of the serum bile concentration after a meal stimulus may provide a valuable index of ileal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
