<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: One form of epithelial cell injury in inflamed colonic mucosa in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) is reported to involve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 family proteins Bax and Bcl-2 are the major regulators of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to elucidate the involvement of the Bax/Bcl-2 system in induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of the inflamed colonic epithelium in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Colonic epithelium was isolated from colonic biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of CD95, Bax, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-2 proteins was determined by western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bax gene expression was assessed by both reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by Southern hybridisation and a real time PCR assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Equal levels of expression of CD95, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-2 proteins were noted in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and UC colonic epithelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Equal levels of expression of Bax protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were noted in epithelia of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon and inactive UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Levels of expression of Bax protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were markedly reduced in inflamed UC colonic epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed for the first time downregulation of Bax in inflamed colonic epithelium of UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Bax/Bcl-2 system did not seem to be involved in induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of epithelial cells in the inflamed colonic mucosa of UC </plain></SENT>
