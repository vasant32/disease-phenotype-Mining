<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A CPE was produced in W138 cells by tissue homogenates from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evidence was obtained to suggest that this effect, although superficially similar to a <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> CPE, was due to toxic protein constituents of inflamed tissue homogenate </plain></SENT>
