<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty three quadruple loop ileal pouches constructed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (20 patients) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">familial adenomatous polyposis</z:e> (FAP) (three patients) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No patient fulfilled clinical, endoscopic, or histopathological criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Standard duplicate biopsy specimens were taken from the proximal limb, the anterior wall, the posterior wall, and the body of the reservoir </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An established scoring system was used and showed a highly significant increase in inflammatory scores in posterior wall biopsy specimens compared with those from the anterior wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the adaptive changes are the direct result of contact with static faecal contents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient only showed significant <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the proximal limb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of mucosal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> in any anterior wall biopsy specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> showed substantially more inflammatory and architectural changes than those with FAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ninety six per cent of pouches showed some colonic phenotypic expression as defined by mucin histochemical and PR 3A5 immunohistochemical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest, however, that there may not be complete colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and that the mucin changes and other phenotypic alterations may represent a non-specific response to pouch <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and not a prerequisite for the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The focal nature of the inflammatory and architectural changes, which may be the result of direct contact with static faecal residue, are clearly shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A single random biopsy specimen of pouch mucosa is of limited value in assessing pathological changes and screening for potential neoplastic change within the reservoir </plain></SENT>
