<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the clinical significance of mucosal expression of suppressors of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) and SOCS3 in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Biopsy specimens for histological analysis and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> detection were obtained endoscopically from the rectum of 62 patients with UC (36 men; age 13-76 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were classified endoscopically according to Matts' grade (grade 1 to 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> was quantified in samples by competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GAPDH was used as an internal control for efficiency of RT-PCR and amount of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SOCS3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was significantly higher in inflamed mucosa of UC than in inactive mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The level of expression was well correlated with the degree of both endoscopic and histologic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, among the patients in remission, the group with relatively low expression of SOCS3 showed a higher rate of remission maintenance over a 12-mo period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, SOCS1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was expressed in both inflamed and non-inflamed colonic mucosa and was not correlated with the activity of colonic mucosa or prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These observations suggest that increased expression of mucosal SOCS3, but not of SOCS1, may play a critical role in the development of the colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of UC </plain></SENT>
