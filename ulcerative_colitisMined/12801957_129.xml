<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The benefits of infliximab in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> are established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated its efficacy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a randomised placebo controlled trial of infliximab (5 mg/kg) in the treatment of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Infusions were given at weeks 0 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disease activity and quality of life were recorded over eight weeks of follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Remission was defined as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> symptom score (UCSS) of &lt; or =2 and/or Baron score of 0 at week 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients not in remission were offered open label infliximab 10 mg/kg and reviewed two weeks later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After two weeks, there was no statistically significant difference between the infliximab and placebo groups in the proportion of patients with a Baron score of 0 (13% (3/23) v 5% (1/19) (95% confidence interval (CI) -9% to 24%); p=0.74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After six weeks, remission (UCSS &lt; or =2) rates were 39% (9/23) versus 30% (6/20) (95% CI -19 to 34%; p=0.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median improvement in UCSS was 3 for the infliximab group and 2.5 for the placebo group (p=0.82, Mann-Whitney U test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A Baron score of 0 was likely in either group (26% (6/23) v 30% (6/20) (95% CI -30% to 23%); p=0.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Improvement in the IBDQ and EuroQol was not significantly different between the groups (p=0.22 and 0.3, respectively, Mann-Whitney U test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Twenty eligible patients were given open labelled infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Remission was achieved in 3/11 (27%) patients initially treated with infliximab and in 1/9 (11%) patients treated with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data do not support the use of infliximab in the management of moderately active <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
