<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten of the patients (19%) were found to be positive, but the stools of four out of 53 patients without diarrhoea after a course of antibiotics were also found to contain C. difficile toxin (7.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The titre of toxin in patients both with and without diarrhoea fell within the same range (up to 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neither the organism nor its toxin was found in the stool of 26 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, eight with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 49 with non-specific diarrhoea, and 27 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, while C. difficile is responsible for a proportion of cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0578159" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antibiotic-associated diarrhoea</z:e>, the concentration of toxin is not the sole factor affecting the severity of this disorder </plain></SENT>
