<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because considerable evidence implicates substance P (SP) as an inflammatory mediator of CUC, we investigated whether SP participates in the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the use of a rat model of IPAA that we developed, we showed that ileal pouch MPO levels and neurokinin 1 receptor (NK-1R) protein expression by Western blot analysis were significantly elevated 28 days after IPAA surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry showed that the increase in NK-1R protein expression was localized to the lamina propria and epithelia of pouch ileum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intraperitoneal administration of the NK-1R <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (NK-1RA) CJ-12,255 for 4 days, starting on day 28, was effective in reducing MPO levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Starting on day 28, animals with IPAA were given 5% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34674">dextran sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (DSS) in their drinking water for 4 days, which caused histological and physical signs of clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> concomitant with significant increases in ileal pouch MPO concentrations as well as NK-1R protein expression by Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry showed that the increase in NK-1R protein expression was especially evident in crypt epithelia of pouch ileum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the NK-1RA was administered 1 day before starting DSS and continued for the duration of DSS administration, the physical signs of clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> and the rise in MPO were prevented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data implicate SP in the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> and suggest that NK-1RA may be of therapeutic value in the management of clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
