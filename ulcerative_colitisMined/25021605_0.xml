<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> FC tests performed between 01/07/12 and 31/12/12 were systematically collected and associations with activity and distribution using endoscopic, histological and radiological data explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Proximal disease was defined as <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> affecting the terminal ileum and ascending colon; left-sided disease as <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> limited to the colorectum distal to the splenic flexure and pan-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> with <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> extending proximal to the splenic flexure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 203 (n = 160 CD; n = 43 UC) patients with IBD had FC tests performed of whom 96 (47.3%) had endoscopic, histological or radiological evidence of active disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age of IBD patients was 44.7 (SD 17.0) years and 58% were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean FC concentration was significantly higher in patients with active pan-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (1038.1 iu (SD 1104.1)) than in active left-sided disease (mean 820.2 iu (SD 1535.1)); p = 0.01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean FC concentration was significantly higher in active pan-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> than in active proximal disease (mean difference -669.3 iu (95% CI-1046.3, -292.4)); p = &lt;0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the mean FC concentration between active proximal or left-sided disease (mean difference -451.5 (95% CI -965.9, 62.9) or between CD and UC (mean difference 148.5 (95% CI-369.1-666.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Mean FC concentrations are significantly higher in active pan-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> than in active left-sided or proximal disease, perhaps reflective of the greater extent of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further work is required to explore why FC concentrations are lower in proximal disease despite presence of active <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
