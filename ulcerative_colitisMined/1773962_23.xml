<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The radiographs were reviewed without knowledge of the subsequent outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Small bowel distension was defined as the presence of three or more loops of gas filled small bowel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty two patients responded to medical treatment and 33 underwent colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two groups were comparable for age, sex, and length of history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The surgical group had more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849867" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">extensive disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of those who did well on medical therapy, 18 (42.9%) had small bowel distension compared with 24 of 33 (72.7%) who failed medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference was significant (p less than 0.05, odds ratio = 3.55, 95% confidence interval of 2.27-5.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 24 patients with small bowel distension who came to surgery, five had more than four loops of gas filled small bowel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This degree of distension was not seen in any of the patients settling on medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus the presence of small bowel distension on a plain abdominal radiograph in a patient with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> may predict a poor response to medical therapy </plain></SENT>
