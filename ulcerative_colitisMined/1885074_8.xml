<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using two colour immunofluorescence with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">fluorescein isothiocyanate</z:chebi> and phycoerythrin labelled monoclonal antibodies and multiparameter flow cytometry, we investigated the coexpression of CD4 and CD8 antigens on peripheral blood lymphocytes and lamina propria lymphocytes of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both the absolute number and the proportion of peripheral blood CD4+, CD8+ cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> were small but significantly increased compared with those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood lymphocytes activated with phytohaemagglutinin showed appreciably increased coexpression of CD4+, CD8+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These CD4, CD8 positive cells were large and granular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus the increased number of peripheral blood CD4+, CD8+ cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> immune activation occurs not only in the active state of the disease but also in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportion of CD4+, CD8+ cells in the lamina propria was greater than in peripheral blood in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, suggesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> immune stimulation of the local immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was also seen in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> or inactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportion of CD4+, CD8+ cells was, however, significantly less in the lamina propria of patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whether this implies a possible defect in mucosal immunoregulation in active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> cannot be determined from these results </plain></SENT>
