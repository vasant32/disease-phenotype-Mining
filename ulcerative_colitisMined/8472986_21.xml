<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cultural and serological studies have provided limited, often conflicting, evidence of a role for mycobacteria in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interest has focussed on Mycobacterium <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paratuberculosis</z:e>, previously considered to be common in the environment with no major role as a human pathogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whether a specific serum antibody response to mycobacteria occurs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sera from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (n = 38), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (n = 15), and a healthy control population (n = 30) were assayed in an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using eight filtered sonicate mycobacterial preparations and a purified protein derivative made from the bovine tubercle bacillus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, IgG, IgM, and IgA levels to M <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paratuberculosis</z:e> were determined in sera from patients with active (n = 24) or inactive (n = 29) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and the control populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was strong evidence of contact with environmental mycobacteria in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and control populations, with the greatest responses to preparations of M avium, M <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e>, and M kansasii </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A large proportion of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> had antibodies that bound most antigens tested but there were no statistical differences between these values and those of the control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there were no differences in antibody levels to M <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paratuberculosis</z:e> in patient and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although a subset of patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (25%) had IgG concentrations that exceeded the control mean by more than 2 SD, this phenomenon may not be specific to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>: 20% of a small group of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coeliac disease</z:e> had similarly raised IgG levels to M <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paratuberculosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings do not provide serological evidence of a role for this organism in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
