<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the expression of three major mediators of the intestinal salt transport between healthy and inflamed colonic mucosa to understand the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression levels of the cystic <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> transmembrane regulator (CFTR) (<z:chebi fb="193" ids="17996">Cl-</z:chebi> channel), SLC26A3 (<z:chebi fb="193" ids="17996">Cl-</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="4" ids="29327">HCO</z:chebi> exchanger) and SLC9A3 (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>/H+ exchanger) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were measured by real-time quantitative RT-PCR in peroperative colonic samples from controls (n = 4) and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several samples were obtained from each individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue samples were divided into three subgroups according to their histological degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of CFTR and SLC26A3 proteins were determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting from the same samples, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased expression of CFTR <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups of affected tissue samples, most pronounced in mildly inflamed colonic mucosa (5-fold increase in expression; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of the CFTR protein was detected from health and inflamed colon tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the expression of the SLC26A3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was significantly decreased in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.05), the SLC26A3 protein levels remained unchanged in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression of SLC9A3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was significantly changed between the mild and severe groups </plain></SENT>
