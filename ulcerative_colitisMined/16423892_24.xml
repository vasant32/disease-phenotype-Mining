<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In studies with small numbers of cases, it has been shown that endoscopic resection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> represents adequate treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a larger study cohort with more prolonged follow up, we assessed the reliability of this finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1988 and 2002, 148 consecutive patients, mainly from private gastroenterologists' practices, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> were diagnosed as having an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 60 patients, histological diagnosis was established in biopsies and in 87 patients in polypectomy specimens; one patient underwent proctocolectomy following diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The outcome of these patients was analysed after a mean follow up period of 6.0 (3.63) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 60 patients, surprisingly without endoscopic treatment, 48.3% developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in the same colon segment (23.3% low grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>; 8.3% high grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>; 16.7% <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 87 patients undergoing polypectomy of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, follow up revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in other segments of colon in 4.6% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Development of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> in a total of 6.7% of the overall patient group, and in 2.3% of those undergoing polypectomy, indicates that biopsy based diagnosis of an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> must be considered to mandate endoscopic resection of the lesion; 40% of affected patients did not receive any form of endoscopic removal of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This shows that the most recent guidelines are not followed in a considerable number of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in private practice in Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although polypectomy of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> represents adequate therapy, further regular follow up examinations are nevertheless necessary </plain></SENT>
