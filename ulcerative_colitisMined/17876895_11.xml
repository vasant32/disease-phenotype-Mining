<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a long-term therapy with infliximab in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) patients retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical charts of 50 patients (40 CD and 10 UC), who received after a loading dose of 3 infliximab infusions scheduled re-treatments every 8 wk as a maintenance protocol, were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median (range) duration of treatment was 27 (4-64) mo in CD patients and 24.5 (6-46) mo in UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall, 32 (80%) CD and 9 (90%) UC patients showed a sustained clinical response or remission throughout the maintenance period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three CD patients shortened the interval between infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight (20%) CD patients and 1 UC patient underwent surgery for flare up of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine out of 29 CD and 4 out of 9 UC patients, who discontinued infliximab scheduled treatment, are still relapse-free after a median of 16 (5-30) and 6.5 (4-16) mo following the last infusion, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten CD patients (25%) and 1 UC patient required concomitant steroid therapy during maintenance period, compared to 30 (75%) and 9 (90%) patients at enrollment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 50 patients, 16 (32%) experienced at least 1 adverse event and 3 patients (6%) were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> during maintenance treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Scheduled infliximab strategy is effective in maintaining long-term clinical remission both in CD and UC and determines a marked steroid sparing effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Long-lasting remission was observed following infliximab withdrawal </plain></SENT>
