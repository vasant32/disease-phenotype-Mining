<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to evaluate possible associations between C activation capacity and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma from patients with exacerbations of UC (n = 18) or CD (n = 18) were collected before and during high dose <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> treatment (1 mg/kg body weight) and tapering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Friedman's two way analysis of variance, Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon signed-rank sum test were used RESULTS: Before treatment, plasma from CD patients showed significant elevations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> C-mediated analyses compared to the values obtained from 38 healthy controls (p &lt; 0.02), and in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28808">mannan</z:chebi> binding lectin (MBL)-concentration and MBL-C4-activation capacity (AC) values compared to UC patients (p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before treatment, plasma from UC patients showed significant elevations only in the classical pathway-mediated C3-AC compared to values obtained from healthy controls (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After treatment was initiated, significant reductions, which persisted during follow-up, were observed in the classical pathway-mediated C3-AC and MBL-C4-AC in plasma from CD patients (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that C activation capacity is up-regulated significantly in plasma from CD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The decreases observed after <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> treatment reflect a general down-regulation in immune activation </plain></SENT>
