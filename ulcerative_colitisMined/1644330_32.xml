<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To assess whether dietary antigens play a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, 26 monozygotic twin pairs with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> and 52 healthy controls were investigated for serum antibodies (IgA, IgG, IgM) against ovalbumin, betalactoglobulin, gliadin, whole yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and yeast cell wall <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28808">mannan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The twins were made up of five pairs concordant and nine pairs discordant for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, and two pairs concordant and 10 pairs discordant for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> had a slight increase in disease activity, the others were in clinical remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two striking observations were made: first, individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> were indistinguishable from healthy twins, and controls except for the response to gliadin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both healthy and diseased twins had higher IgA levels to gliadin than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Second, twins who had developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> displayed higher antibody titres towards yeast cell wall <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28808">mannan</z:chebi> in particular, but also to whole yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> antibody types (IgA, IgG, and IgM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the response to gliadin, ovalbumin, and betalactoglobulin did not differ from healthy twins and was even lower than in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results argue against an increased systemic antigen presentation caused by an impaired mucosal barrier in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rather, they suggest that yeast cell wall material--that is, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28808">mannan</z:chebi>, or some antigen rich in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> and cross reacting with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28808">mannan</z:chebi>, may play an aetiological role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, but not in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The increases in IgA and IgM, as well as IgG suggest that local and systemic immune systems are selectively activated by antigen(s) present in the cell wall of baker's yeast </plain></SENT>
