<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The group of CD patients consisted of 11 patients with newly diagnosed, short-standing and so far untreated CD (group CD 1) and 10 patients previously treated with drugs and with mostly long-standing CD (group CD 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results showed that the MLC responsiveness was similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> groups, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and diseased controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While there was no correlation between MLC responsiveness and either disease activity or disease duration when compared singly, those CD 2 patients who had highly active and/or very long-standing disease did exhibit a depressed MLC responsiveness as compared with that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (p less than 0.001), CD 1 patients who had both inactive and short-standing disease (P less than 0.05), and diseased controls (0.1 greater than or equal to P greater than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The stimulatory capacity did not differ significantly between the CD groups and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects or diseased controls; the latter, however, stimulated poorly compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In accordance, an inverse relationship between the magnitude of the stimulatory capacity and the disease activity was found in the CD patients as a whole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that there is no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of the in vitro primary cell mediated immune response as a predisposing factor for CD or as an early event associated with the pathogenesis of CD </plain></SENT>
