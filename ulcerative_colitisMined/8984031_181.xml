<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Simple criteria are needed to predict which patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> will respond poorly to intensive medical treatment and require colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To find out if the early pattern of change in inflammatory markers or other variables could predict the need for surgery and to evaluate the outcome of medical treatment during one year follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 51 consecutive episodes of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (Truelove and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271977" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Witts</z:e> criteria) affecting 49 patients admitted to John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective study monitoring 36 clinical, laboratory, and radiographic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> episodes treated with intravenous and rectal <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi> and 14 of 51 with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete response in 21 episodes (&lt; or = 3 stools on day 7, without visible blood), incomplete response in 15 (&gt; 3 stools or visible blood on day 7, but no colectomy), and colectomy on that admission in 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the first five days, stool frequency and C reactive protein (CRP) distinguished between outcomes (p &lt; 0.00625, corrected for multiple comparisons) irrespective of whether patients or the number of episodes were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It could be predicted on day 3, that 85% of patients with more than eight stools on that day, or a stool frequency between three and eight together with a CRP &gt; 45 mg/l, would require colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For patients given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>, four of 14 avoided colectomy but two continued to have symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After admission, complete responders remained in remission for a median nine months and had a 5% chance of colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Incomplete responders had a 60% chance of continuous symptoms and 40% chance of colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After three days intensive treatment, patients with frequent stools (&gt; 8/day), or raised CRP (&gt; 45 mg/l) need to be identified, as most will require colectomy on that admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> for treating severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> has yet to be defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>After seven days' treatment, patients with &gt; 3 stools/day of visible blood have a 60% chance of continuous symptoms and 40% chance of colectomy in the following months </plain></SENT>
