<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of the coded diagnoses was checked by examination of the hospital notes of 144 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The coded diagnosis was incorrect in 11/83 coded as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and 13/61 as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>; frequency of incorrect coding did not change significantly with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite an 18% fall in the population aged less than or equal to 16 during this time, the number of new cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> rose from 10 in 1968 to 28 in 1983 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus the recorded incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> in Scottish children has risen more than three-fold in 16 years, from 6.6 to 22.9 per million (p less than 0.0001), with no difference between the sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Parallel data for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> were rendered inaccurate by miscoding of infective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017160" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastroenteritis</z:e> as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to reduce this source of error cases aged five years and under were excluded from analysis, resulting in an incidence of 19.1 cases per million aged six to 16 in 1968 and 15.6 in 1983, not a significant change (r = 0.42, p = 0.052) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When males and females were analysed separately, however, there was a significant decrease in the incidence of UC in male children (r = -0.4, p = 0.028), with no change for female children (r = 0.1, p = 0.595) </plain></SENT>
