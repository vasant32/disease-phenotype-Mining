<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether such deposition is specific for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, we examined <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> fixed mucosal specimens from 18 patients with Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and 14 with terminal <z:mp ids='MP_0009482'>ileitis</z:mp> by indirect two colour immunofluorescence staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal antibodies to the IgG subclasses and to neoepitopes of activated complement C3b and the terminal complement complex were used in combination with rabbit antiserum to C1q, C4c or cytokeratin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Granular deposition of C3b and terminal complement complex were observed at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> face of the surface epithelium in 10 of 18 patients with Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specimens from eight of 14 patients with ileal involvement were intensely stained for activated complement (primarily C3b) within the surface mucus layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No epithelial IgG, C1q or C4c deposition was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that early and late phase complement activation takes place at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> face of the epithelium in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The absence of colocalised IgG and complement components involved in the classical activation pathway (C1q and C4c), however, suggest that other immunopathological mechanisms (the alternative pathway?) are primarily involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> in contrast with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
