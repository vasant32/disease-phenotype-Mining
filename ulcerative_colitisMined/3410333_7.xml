<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ig was estimated by enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA) for IgA, secretory IgA (sIgA), IgM, and IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In parallel, numbers of IgA plasma cells were estimated by indirect immunoperoxidase staining of tissue sections for IgA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgA was the dominant Ig isotype found pre-existing in colonic mucosae, and secreted in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In UC patients, preformed tissue IgA and IgA produced in vitro were significantly increased compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no concomitant increase in amounts of sIgA synthesised in culture, however, although numbers of IgA plasma cells were increased in UC patients by an amount comparable with the increased in vitro IgA production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results directly show a dysfunction of transepithelial IgA secretion in quiescent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite a significantly raised concentration of tissue IgG in UC patients, little was produced in vitro in patient and control groups alike, suggesting that mucosal IgG was serum derived, and not linked to local IgA production </plain></SENT>
