<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) are <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> multifactorial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> (IBDs) with unknown aetiology, but a deregulated mucosal immune response to gut-derived <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> antigens is thought to be involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Toll-like receptor ligands, especially <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS), contribute to the maintenance of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has previously been shown that the enzyme alkaline phosphatase (AP) is able to detoxify LPS, and the aim of this study was to examine a possible role in IBDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Intestinal AP (iAP) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and LPS dephosphorylation in intestinal biopsies of control subjects and patients with IBD were examined, and the effect of orally administered iAP tablets on the progression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32149">sodium sulfate</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in rats was subsequently studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In healthy persons, iAP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and enzyme activity was high in the ileum relative to the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with UC and CD, iAP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was found to be markedly reduced when inflamed tissue was compared with non-inflamed tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Oral administration of iAP tablets to colitic rats resulted in a significant attenuation of colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> as reflected by reduced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha, interleukin 1 beta, interleukin 6 and inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase NOS (iNOS), a reduced iNOS staining and inflammatory cell influx, and a significantly improved <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the intestinal wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that epithelial iAP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression is reduced in patients with UC and CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rat model demonstrates that oral administration of active iAP enzymes in the intestinal tract results in a significant reduction of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This provides new insight on IBD pathology and a novel treatment approach to this severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
