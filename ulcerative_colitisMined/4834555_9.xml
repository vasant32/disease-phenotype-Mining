<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of migration was obtained only with Kunin antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was present in 11 out of 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and in four out of 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> but in only one out of 33 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest the possibility that a state of cellular immunity to enterobacterial common antigen may exist in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lack of cellular reactivity to extract from germ-free faeces and Kveim suspension is in contrast with the results obtained by others by means of the capillary tube method and requires further investigation </plain></SENT>
