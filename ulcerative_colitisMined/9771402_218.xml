<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The appropriate medical treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> is determined largely by the severity of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hospital assessment of the severity of disease activity includes investigation of laboratory indices and sigmoidoscopic assessment of mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To develop a simplified clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> activity index to aid in the initial evaluation of exacerbations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The information for development of the simple index was initially evaluated in 63 assessments of disease activity in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> where disease activity was evaluated using the Powell-Tuck Index (which includes symptoms, physical signs, and sigmoidoscopic appearance) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The new index was then further evaluated in 113 assessments in a different group of patients, by comparison with a complex index utilising clinical and laboratory data, as well as five haematological and biochemical markers of disease severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The newly devised Simple Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>Colitis</z:hpo> Activity Index, consisting of scores for five clinical criteria, showed a highly significant correlation with the Powell-Tuck Index (r = 0.959, p &lt; 0.0001) as well as the complex index (r = 0.924, p &lt; 0.0001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> laboratory markers (p = 0.0003 to p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This new Simple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>Colitis</z:hpo> Activity Index shows good correlation with existing more complex scoring systems and therefore could be useful in the initial assessment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
