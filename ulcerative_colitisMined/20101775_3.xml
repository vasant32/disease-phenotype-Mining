<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and sixty-four patients with IBD [105 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and 59 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC)] and 100 healthy controls were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genotyping of the PTPN22 gene 1858C--&gt;T polymorphism was performed by restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction with RsaI digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The genotypic and allelic frequencies of (R620W) PTPN22 gene polymorphism reveal a significant association of the PTPN22 620-W allele with IBD, compared to the healthy control group (OR: 17.81, 95% CI: 4.18-21.86, P = 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, no difference in this polymorphism was found between CD and UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant association was found between the frequencies of genotypes of the PTPN22 gene with either the clinical features such as sex, age, age at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, or the production of serological markers (anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody in CD and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody in UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These observations confirm the association of IBD susceptibility with the PTPN22 1858T (620-W) allele in Tunisian patients </plain></SENT>
