<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the prevalence of clinically significant lesions in patients with minimal bright red <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> per rectum (BRBPR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive outpatients prospectively underwent colonoscopy at Loghman Hakim Hospital, Tehran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Minimal BRBPR was defined as small amounts of red blood after wiping or in the toilet bowl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with the following alarm signs were excluded: Positive personal history of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD), positive first degree family history of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, history of altered bowel habits, recent significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, and presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neoplastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, and IBD were defined as significant lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 402 patients (183 female and 219 male, aged 43.6 +/- 15.7 years) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hemorrhoids</z:e> (54.2%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">anal fissures</z:e> (14.2%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (14.2%) were the most common lesions and colonoscopy was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 8.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant lesions were found in 121 (30.1%) patients, including 26 patients (6.5%) with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and 30 (7.5%) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with significant lesions had at least one lesion in the distal colon; an <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyp</z:mpath> in the proximal colon were found in 2 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhoids</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Flexible sigmoidoscopy appears to be sufficient for the evaluation of average risk patients with minimal BRBPR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rigid sigmoidoscopy may be used as an alternative in patients less than 40 years of age in settings where the former is not available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The choice of colonoscopy over flexible sigmoidoscopy in patients aged over 50 years should be individualized </plain></SENT>
