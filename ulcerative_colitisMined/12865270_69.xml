<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between 1978 and 1990, 160 patients with longstanding extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) were recruited for annual colonoscopic surveillance and 40 developed LGD at some stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the outcome of this cohort 10 years after the original study ended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective cohort study and histopathological review of the original diagnoses of LGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The outcome of 158/160 (98.8%) patients was established in 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 128 patients still alive and with an intact colon at the end of 1990, two were not traceable, 29 had LGD, and 97 had no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 10 years, high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> developed in 3/29 LGD (10%) and in 4/97 controls (4.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis from 1991 to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or colectomy did not show a statistically significant difference between the two groups (log rank test p=0.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histopathological review demonstrated the unreliability of LGD diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Agreement between pathologists was uniformly poor: kappa &lt;0.4 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: LGD diagnosis is not sufficiently reliable to justify prophylactic colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conservative management of established LGD cases should not be ruled out </plain></SENT>
