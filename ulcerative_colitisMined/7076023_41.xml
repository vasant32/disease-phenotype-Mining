<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is in contrast with 65 cases of non-specific <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> where the mucin pattern of rectal biopsies was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> except one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The abnormal mucin secretion in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> was apparently related to the activity, duration, and extent of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> biopsies with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> showed predominant sialomucin staining except one </plain></SENT>
