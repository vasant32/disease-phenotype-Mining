<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A major advancement in our understanding of the pathogenesis of these diseases has been the development of mouse models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> gut <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One model that has been instrumental in delineating the immunological mechanisms responsible for the induction as well as regulation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> is the T cell transfer model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100281'>chronic colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This paper presents a detailed protocol describing the methods used to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0100281'>chronic colitis</z:hpo> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Special attention is given to the immunological concepts that explain disease pathogenesis in this model, considerations and potential pitfalls in using this model, and finally different "tricks" that we have learned over the past 12 years that have allowed us to develop a more simplified version of this model of experimental IBD </plain></SENT>
