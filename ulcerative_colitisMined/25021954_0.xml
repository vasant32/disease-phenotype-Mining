<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The European Crohn's and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>Colitis</z:hpo> Organisation recommend tissue PCR or immunohistochemistry for CMV detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to review experience of assessing patients attending a single unit with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> UC for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A policy of biopsy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> was adopted for people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> severe UC admitted to hospital (n = 37) or deteriorating symptoms as an out-patient (n = 8) from 2011-2013 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical severity was measured by Mayo score and endoscopic activity by Baron score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were assessed for CMV <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA by realtime PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum IgG and IgM antibodies to CMV were measured by chemiluminescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Biopsies were obtained from 45 patients with UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>13/45 (28.9%) were positive for CMV DNA (median titre 34900; range 776-1540000 copies/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>9/13 (69.2%) CMV PCR positive (+) patients were steroid refractory compared to 14/32 (43.8%) CMV PCR negative (-) p = 0.12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median Day 3 Mayo scores were 8 for the CMV+ group and 6 for the CMV- group (p = 0.59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of IPs biopsied up to Day 1 of IV steroids (range -4-1), 6/22 were CMV+ and from Day 2 (median 6; 2-19), 5/20 were CMV+ (p = 0.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Median cumulative steroid dose prior to biopsy was 0.28 g <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> equivalent for CMV+ patients and 0.39 g for CMV- patients (p = 0.51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>3/13 CMV+ patients had had <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> â‰¥10 mg/day for &gt; 14 days prior to biopsy and 11/32 CMV- patients (p = 0.46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No biopsies contained typical histological features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Mayo and Baron scores did not differ between CMV+ and CMV- patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Mucosal CMV DNA titre in CMV+ patients did not correlate with Baron or Mayo scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Of the mucosal CMV+ patients, 8/8 tested (100%) were anti-CMV IgG positive with 0/7 IgM positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood CMV PCR was positive in 10/13 in the biopsy PCR+ group and 0/7 in those biopsy PCR- (sensitivity 60%, specificity 100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>12/13 CMV PCR+ patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>11/13 (84.6%) achieved remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>2/13 (15.3%) CMV+ and 2/32 (6.2%) CMV- required colectomy (p = 0.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 6 patients treated concomitantly with Infliximab and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi> responded fully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PCR of mucosal biopsies detects <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> due to <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> reactivation in almost a third of patients with deteriorating or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> severe UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>No relationship was demonstrated between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> and disease severity, response to treatment or prior steroid use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Treatment with anti-TNF agents was administered safely in combination with anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> drugs </plain></SENT>
