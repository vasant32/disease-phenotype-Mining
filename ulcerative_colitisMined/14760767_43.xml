<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: An investigation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Veszprem Province was conducted from 1977 to 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Both hospital and outpatient records were collected and reviewed comprehensively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients were followed up regularly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The population of the province was decreased from 386,000 to 376,000 during the period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five hundred sixty new cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), 212 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), and 40 of indeterminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (IC) were diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence rates increased from 1.66 to 11.01 cases per 100,000 persons for UC, from 0.41 to 4.68 for CD and from 0.26 to 0.74 for IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence rate at the end of 2001 was 142.6 for UC and 52.9 cases per 100,000 persons for CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The peak <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age in UC patients was between 30 and 40 years, in CD between 20 and 30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A family history of IBD was present in 3.4 % in UC and 9.9 % in CD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Smoking increased the risk for CD (OR=1.98) while it decreased the risk for UC (OR=0.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twelve colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> were observed in this cohort, the cumulative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk after 10 years in UC was 2%, after 20 years 8.8%, after 30 years 13.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The incidence and prevalence rates of IBD have increased steadily in Veszprem Province, now equivalent to that in Western European countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Rapid increase in incidence rates supports a probable role for environmental factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> in IBD is similar to that observed in Western countries </plain></SENT>
