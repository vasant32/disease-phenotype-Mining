<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cholecystokinin (CCK) concentrations in plasma have been shown to be significantly higher in colectomised subjects compared to healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This has been ascribed to reduced inhibition of CCK release from colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In an earlier study CCK in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one woman who was colectomised, induced release of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="7872">oxytocin</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> present throughout the gastrointestinal (GI) tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was thus to examine if colectomised women had a different <z:chebi fb="5" ids="7872">oxytocin</z:chebi> response to CCK compared to healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven women, mean age 34.4 +/- 2.3 years, who had undergone colectomy because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven age-matched healthy women served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were fasted overnight and given 0.2 microg/kg body weight of CCK-8 i.v. in the morning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Samples were taken ten minutes and immediately before the injection, and 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min afterwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma was collected for measurement of CCK and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="7872">oxytocin</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The basal <z:chebi fb="5" ids="7872">oxytocin</z:chebi> and CCK concentrations in plasma were similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intravenous injection of CCK increased the release of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="7872">oxytocin</z:chebi> from 1.31 +/- 0.12 and 1.64 +/- 0.19 pmol/l to 2.82 +/- 0.35 and 3.26 +/- 0.50 pmol/l in controls and colectomised women, respectively (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Given the short half-life of CCK-8 in plasma, the increased concentration following injection could not be demonstrated in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in colectomised women, an increase of CCK in plasma was observed for up to 20 minutes after the injection, concentrations increasing from 1.00 +/- 0.21 to a maximum of 1.81 +/- 0.26 pmol/l (p &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CCK stimulates the release of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="7872">oxytocin</z:chebi> in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There is no difference in plasma concentrations between colectomised and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, colectomy seems to reduce the metabolic clearance of CCK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The hyperCCKemia in patients who had undergone colectomy is consequently not only dependent on CCK release, but may also depend on reduced clearance </plain></SENT>
