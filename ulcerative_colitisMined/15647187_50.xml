<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Breakdown of tolerance against the commensal microflora is believed to be a major factor in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dendritic cells (DC) have been implicated in this process in various animal models, but data on human DC in IBD are very limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To characterise plasmacytoid DC (PDC) and myeloid DC (MDC) in patients with active versus inactive IBD and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood was obtained from 106 patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) n=49, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) n=57) and healthy controls (n=19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was scored using the modified Truelove <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271977" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Witts</z:e> (MTWSI) for UC and the Harvey Bradshaw severity indices (HBSI) for CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four colour flow cytometric analysis was used to identify, enumerate, and phenotype DC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DC from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> flare ups and healthy controls were cultured and stimulated with CpG ODN 2006 or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IBD patients in remission (PDC UC, 0.39%; CD, 0.35%; MDC-1 UC, 0.23%; CD, 0.22% of PBMC) have slightly lower numbers of circulating DC compared with healthy controls (PDC 0.41%, MDC-1 0.25% of PBMC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> flare ups IBD patients experience a significant drop of DC (PDC UC, 0.04%; CD, 0.11%; MDC-1 UC, 0.11%; CD, 0.14% of PBMC) that correlates with disease activity (correlation coefficients: PDC MTWSI, 0.93; HBSI, 0.79; MDC-1 MTWSI, 0.75; HBSI, 0.81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, both express alpha4beta7 integrin and display an immature phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Freshly isolated PDC and MDC-1 from untreated flaring IBD patients express higher baseline levels of CD86 which increases further in culture and upon stimulation compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IBD patients lack immature blood DC during flare ups which possibly migrate to the gut </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An aberrant response to microbial surrogate stimuli suggests a disturbed interaction with commensals </plain></SENT>
