<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A definition of disease activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) is difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical activity index (CAI) is only an indirect assessment tool of bowel <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and the endoscopic activity index (EAI) sometimes cannot reflect the severity of disease to the full extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, there is a need for an objective means to quantify inflammatory activity in mucosal biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In our study, we wanted to examine the correlation between transcript levels of interleukin 8 (CXCL8), interferon gamma inducible protein 10 (CXCL10), myeloid-related protein 14 (calgranulin B), macrophage inflammatory protein 2 alpha (CXCL2) with CAI and EAI in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cytokine and chemokine transcripts were quantified using real-time PCR in 49 mucosal biopsies from 27 different patients with UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytokine transcript levels were correlated with CAI and EAI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a statistically significant positive correlation between CXCL8 (r = 0.30; p &lt; 0.05), CXCL10 (r = 0.40; p &lt; 0.02), calgranulin B (r = 0.36; p &lt; 0.03), CXCL2 (r = 0.31; p &lt; 0.05) and CAI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concerning EAI significant positive correlations for CXCL8 (r = 0.37; p &lt; 0.02), CXCL10 (r = 0.33; p &lt; 0.04), calgranulin B (r = 0.31; p &lt; 0.05) and CXCL2 (r = 0.44; p &lt; 0.05) were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low clinical and endoscopic activity was accompanied by low cytokine levels whereas high CAI and EAI were associated with high cytokine levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: From our data, we conclude that real-time PCR quantification of CXCL8, CXCL10, calgranulin B and CXCL2 in colonic biopsies is a simple and objective method for grading <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of intestinal mucosa in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CXCL8, CXCL10, calgranulin B and CXCL2 might be used as biomarkers and thus as an objective tool especially in clinical trials to evaluate anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory regimens </plain></SENT>
