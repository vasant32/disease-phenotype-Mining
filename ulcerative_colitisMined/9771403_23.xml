<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: An imbalance between the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (IL-1ra) has been postulated as a pathogenic factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To study allelic frequencies of novel polymorphisms in the genes for IL-1 beta and IL-1ra in patients with IBD and to assess the relation between ex vivo cytokine production and allelic variants of the IL-1 beta and IL-1ra genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Two hundred and seventy healthy controls, 74 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), 72 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), 40 with primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> for the allelic frequencies, and 60 healthy individuals for the ex vivo stimulation test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction and subsequent cleavage with specific endonucleases (Mwo1, MspAI1, Alu1, Taq1, BsoF1) for five novel restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) in the genes for IL-1ra and IL-1 beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the allelic frequencies or allele carriage rates of the markers in the IL-1 beta and IL-1ra genes between CD, UC, and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No association between the genetic markers and cytokine production levels was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with UC carried the combination of both the infrequent allele of the Taq1 RFLP and the Mwo1 RFLP significantly more frequently (35.2% in UC versus 71.1% in controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: UC is associated with carriage of both infrequent alleles of the Taq1 and Mwo1 RFLPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, it could not be confirmed whether the association reflects a pathogenic mechanism underlying UC </plain></SENT>
