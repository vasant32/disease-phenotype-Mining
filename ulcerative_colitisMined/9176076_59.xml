<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To assess the efficacy of topical SCFA treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 103 patients with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> were entered into a six week, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of rectal SCFA twice daily; patients who were unchanged on placebo were offered SCFA in an open-label extension trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 91 patients completing the trial, more patients in the SCFA treated than in the placebo treated group improved (33% v 20%, p = 0.14, NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those on SCFA also had larger, but statistically non-significant, reductions in every component of their clinical and histological activity scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with a relatively short current episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (&lt; 6 months, n = 42), more responded to SCFA than to placebo (48% v 18%, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These patients also had larger, but statistically non-significant, decreases in their clinical activity index (p = 0.08 v placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Every patient who improved used at least five of six of the prescribed rectal SCFA irrigations, whereas only 37% who did not improve were as compliant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the open-label extension trial, 65% improved on SCFA; these patients also had significant reductions (p &lt; 0.02) in their clinical and histological activity scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although SCFA enemas were not of therapeutic value in this controlled trial, the results suggest efficacy in subsets of patients with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> including those with short active episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prolonged contact with rectal mucosa seems to be necessary for therapeutic benefit </plain></SENT>
