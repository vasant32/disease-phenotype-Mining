<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A population based epidemiological study identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) resident in the Florence area in the period 1978-1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To assess the mortality of unselected patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) in a Mediterranean country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Overall, 920 patients (689 UC and 231 CD) were followed until <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or end of follow up (31 December 1996) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Information on vital status was available for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> except eight patients (0.9%); 70 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were identified (23 in patients with CD and 47 in patients with UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were estimated on the basis of five year age group, gender, and calendar year national mortality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Standardised mortality ratios (SMR) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: General mortality was significantly lower than expected in UC (SMR 0.6; 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 0.8), due to a reduced number of cardiovascular and, possibly, smoking related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancers</z:e> of the respiratory tract were significantly reduced in UC but tended to be increased in patients with CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These latter patients had not only an increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> mortality but also a 40% increased risk of dying for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes already evident in the first five year follow up period and persisting thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in patients with UC, SMRs were initially very low but tended to increase steadily over the follow up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were particularly increased in patients with CD, but only moderately in those with UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, there was some evidence of a twofold increased mortality for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, the risk being highest for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> in patients with UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A non-significant excess of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> due to haemolymphopoietic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0812393,C0038661" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">suicides</z:e> was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study, the first in a Mediterranean country, supports the existence of two divergent mortality patterns for patients with UC and CD, possibly explained by differences in smoking habits and by a greater severity of CD </plain></SENT>
