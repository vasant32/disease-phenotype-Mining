<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate possibility and clinical application of fecal calprotectin in determining disease activity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the concentrations of calprotectin in feces obtained from 66 patients with UC and 20 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), acid <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (AGP) were also measured and were compared with calprotectin in determining disease activity of UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The disease activity of UC was also determined by the Sutherland criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The fecal calprotectin concentration in the patients with active UC was significantly higher than that in the inactive UC and in the controls (402.16 +/- 48.0 microg/g vs 35.93 +/- 3.39 microg/g, 11.5 +/- 3.42 microg/g, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fecal calprotectin concentration in the inactive UC group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant difference was also found in the patients with active UC of mild, moderate and severe degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristics (AUCROC) was 0.975, 0.740, 0.692 and 0.737 for fecal calprotectin, CRP, ESR and AGP, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a strong correlation between the fecal calprotectin concentration and the endoscopic gradings for UC (r = 0.866, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Calprotectin in the patient's feces can reflect the disease activity of UC and can be used as a rational fecal marker for <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This kind of marker is relatively precise, simple and noninvasive when compared with other commonly-used markers such as CRP, ESR and AGP </plain></SENT>
