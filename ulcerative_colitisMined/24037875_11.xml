<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Full understanding of pathogenesis will require a comprehensive grasp of the delicate homeostasis between gut bacteria and the human host </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this review, we present current evidence of microbiome-gene interactions in the context of other known risk factors and mechanisms, and describe the next steps necessary to pair genetic variant and microbiome sequencing data from patient cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We discuss the concept of dysbiosis, proposing that the functional composition of the gut microbiome may provide a more consistent definition of dysbiosis and may more readily provide evidence of genome-microbiome interactions in future exploratory studies </plain></SENT>
