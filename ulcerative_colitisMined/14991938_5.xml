<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the effect of acupuncture and moxibustion on epithelial cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and expression of Bcl-2, Bax, fas and FasL proteins in rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> was established by immunological methods and local stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats were randomly divided into model control group (MC), electro-acupuncture group (EA), herbs-partition moxibustion group (HPM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> rats were used as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group (NC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Epithelial cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and expression of Bcl-2, Bax, fas and FasL proteins were detected by TUNEL and immunohistochemical method respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of epithelial cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in MC was significantly higher than that in NC, and was markedly decreased after the treatment with herbs-partition moxibustion or electro-acupuncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of Bcl-2, Bax, fas and FasL in colonic epithelial cells in MC was higher than that in NC, and was markedly down- regulated by herbs-partition moxibustion or electro-acupuncture treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in rats involves abnormality of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Acupuncture and moxibustion can regulate the expression of Bcl-2, Bax, fas and FasL proteins and inhibit the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of epithelial cells of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in rats by Bcl-2/Bax, fas/FasL pathways </plain></SENT>
