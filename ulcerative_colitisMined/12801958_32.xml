<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Longstanding <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), especially in the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_129'>epithelial dysplasia</z:mpath>, is associated with an increased risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is not visible during routine endoscopy, at least 40-50 random biopsies in four quadrants every 10 cm are recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence endoscopy after sensitisation with 5-aminolaevulinic acid (5-ALA) was assessed for the detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> by taking optical guided biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>5-ALA is converted intracellularly into the sensitiser <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi> IX which accumulates selectively in neoplastic tissue allowing the detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> by typical red fluorescence after illumination with blue light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 37 patients with UC, 54 examinations were performed with fluorescence endoscopy after oral (20 mg/kg) or local (either with an enema or by spraying the mucosa with a catheter) sensitisation with 5-ALA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 481 biopsies of red fluorescent (n=218) and non-fluorescent (n=263) areas of the colonic mucosa were taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty two biopsies in 12 patients revealed either low grade (n=40) or high grade (n=2) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity of fluorescence for dysplastic lesions was excellent and ranged from 87% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73-1.00) to 100% (95% CI 1.00-1.00) after local sensitisation, in contrast with only 43% (95% CI 0.17-0.69) after systemic administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Specificity did not differ for both forms of local sensitisation (enema 51% (95% CI 0.44-0.57) and spray catheter 62% (95% CI 0.51-0.73)); after systemic sensitisation specificity was 73% (95% CI 0.69-0.83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Negative predictive values of non-fluorescent mucosa for exclusion of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were very high; 89% after systemic sensitisation and 98-100% after local sensitisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Positive predictive values were 13% and 14% after local sensitisation with enema and spray catheter, and 21% after oral sensitisation with 20 mg/kg ALA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall number of biopsies per examination was less than five from fluorescent positive areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Fluorescence endoscopy after 5-ALA sensitisation is a possible tool to visualise dysplastic lesions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> using 5-ALA sensitisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Local sensitisation is a promising alternative approach compared with systemic administration of 5-ALA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A randomised controlled study is now indicated to compare the efficacy of endoscopic fluorescence detection with the standard technique of four quadrant random biopsies </plain></SENT>
