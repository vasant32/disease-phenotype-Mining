<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) is associated with changes in colonic motility which may contribute to the pain and diarrhoea associated with exacerbations of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These changes may be mediated by <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandins</z:chebi> which are increased in this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increased expression of the inducible isoform of cyclo-oxygenase (COX-2) has been found in active IBD although its cellular distribution remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To evaluate the cellular distribution of COX-2 in active IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridisation, and immunohistochemistry, COX-2 expression was evaluated in 12 colectomy specimens from patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), and six specimens from patients with Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> that had failed medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon was obtained from 12 patients having resection for colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and evaluated as above, acting as control specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> specimens expressed COX-2 mRNA, with some 6-8-fold increase in inflamed tissues on densitometric analysis (both UC and Crohn's) compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridisation localised this <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> to myenteric neural cells, surrounding smooth muscle cells, and inflammatory cells of the lamina propria in the IBD specimens, with some weaker labelling seen in the epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No COX-2 labelling was seen in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry confirmed these sites of COX-2 expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> inflamed specimens, with absence of immunoreactivity in control tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide the first evidence of COX-2 expression in neural cells of the myenteric plexus in active IBD which, via increased <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> synthesis at this site, may contribute to the dysmotilty seen in this condition </plain></SENT>
