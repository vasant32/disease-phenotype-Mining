<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data on the safety of these drugs in pregnancy are sparse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To examine the risk of adverse birth outcome in women who were prescribed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> drugs during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Women were included in the study if they were prescribed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> drugs immediately before or during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To examine the risk of malformations, we included 60 pregnancies exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> drugs 30 days before pregnancy or in the first trimester </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To examine <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillbirths</z:hpo>, preterm births, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo>, we included 88 pregnancies exposed during the entire pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were compared with those of 19 418 pregnancies in which no drugs were prescribed for mothers during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a Danish cohort study based on data from a population based prescription registry, the Danish Birth Registry, and the Hospital Discharge Registry in North Jutland County </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Odds ratios for malformations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillbirth</z:hpo>, preterm birth, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> in women who received prescriptions for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> drugs were 1.9 (95% confidence interval 0.7-5.4), 6.4 (1.7-24.9), 1.9 (0.9-3.9), and 1.2 (0.4-3.3), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillbirth</z:hpo> and preterm birth were found only in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillbirth</z:hpo> and preterm birth in women who had been prescribed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> drugs during pregnancy but no substantial increased risk of malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It was difficult to distinguish the specific effects of disease activity and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> drugs </plain></SENT>
