<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based colonography represents a new imaging tool which has mainly been investigated for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate this approach for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD), we compared MRI based colonography with conventional colonoscopy for assessing the presence and extent of colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 22 consecutive patients with suspected or known IBD, MRI colonography was performed immediately before conventional colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After bowel cleansing, a T1 positive contrast agent was applied rectally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to T2 weighted sequences, T1 weighted two dimensional and three dimensional Flash acquisitions as well as volume rendered virtual endoscopy were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> images were evaluated with regard to typical MRI features of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with colonoscopy findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Distension and image quality was assessed as good to fair in 97.4% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> colonic segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only four of 154 segments were considered non-diagnostic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With colonoscopy serving as the gold standard, the sensitivity for correctly identifying <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> on a per segment analysis of the colon was 31.6% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and 58.8% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In CD, in most cases mild <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was not diagnosed by MRI while in UC even severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was not always depicted by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Virtual endoscopy did not add any relevant information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MRI based colonography is not suitable for adequately assessing the extent of colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Only severe colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in patients with CD can be sufficiently visualised </plain></SENT>
