<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We were interested in testing the hypothesis that patients with IBD are more likely to be diagnosed with PTC than a control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective cohort analysis was performed using the University of Pennsylvania Health System's electronic database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outpatients from 1998-2009 were included in the search, and patients in the cohort were selected based on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 codes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria included the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and the concurrent diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007115" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">thyroid cancer</z:e> in comparison to a control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using these methods 912 patients with CD and 1774 with UC were compared to 1638 diverticulitis and 19â€…447 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistics were performed using corrected chi-square analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome for this study was the diagnosis of PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Approval to conduct this study was obtained by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Pennsylvania </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age was 47.5 years (range: 18-102 years) and 66% patients were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An analysis of variance model was used to compare the age of PTC diagnosis between the CD, UC, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012813" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticulitis</z:e> groups, and a statistically significant difference in age at PTC diagnosis was noted across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups (F = 6.35, df = 3, P = 0.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The age of PTC diagnosis in CD patients was statistically significantly lower than UC, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012813" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticulitis</z:e> patients (average PTC diagnosis age for CD 25, UC 49, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> 45, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012813" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticulitis</z:e> 63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After covarying for sex and age in 2009, the difference in age at PTC diagnosis remained statistically significant (F = 4.13, df = 3, P = 0.0089) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A total of 86 patients were diagnosed with PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (0.5%) with UC were diagnosed with PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients with UC were not shown to be more likely to develop PTC [odds ratio (OR): 1.544, 95%CI 0.767-3.108] compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Four patients (0.4%) with CD were diagnosed with PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Patients with CD were not shown to be more likely to develop PTC (OR: 1.334, 95%CI 0.485-3.672) compared to a control population with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (0.5%) with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012813" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticulitis</z:e> were diagnosed with PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012813" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticulitis</z:e> were not shown to be more likely to develop PTC (OR: 1.673, 95%CI 0.831-3.368) compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Patients with CD or UC were not less likely to develop PTC compared to those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012813" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticulitis</z:e> (CD OR: 0.80, 95%CI 0.25-2.60; UC OR: 0.92, 95%CI 0.37-2.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>None of the patients used <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi> medications prior to the diagnosis of PTC (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50667">6-mercaptopurine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is a significant difference in age of diagnosis of PTC in patients with CD compared to patients with UC and the control populations studied </plain></SENT>
