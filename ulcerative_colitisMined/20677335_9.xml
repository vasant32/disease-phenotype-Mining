<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence indicates also that cytokines produced by these cells play a major role in initiating and shaping this pathologic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One such cytokine seems to be interleukin (IL)-21, a member of the common gamma-chain-receptor family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IL-21 is produced in excess in the inflamed intestine of patients with IBD mostly by activated CD4+ T helper cells co-expressing interferon-gamma and follicular T helper cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, both in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that excessive IL-21 production leads to the activation of multiple signaling pathways that expand and sustain the ongoing mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this article, we review the available data supporting the pathogenic role of IL-21 in IBD </plain></SENT>
