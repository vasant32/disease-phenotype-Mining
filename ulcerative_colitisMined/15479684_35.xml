<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Lamina propria T lymphocytes (LPL) of the intestinal mucosa are chronically activated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Defective <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of activated LPL was proposed as a key pathogenic mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In fact, increased expression of antiapoptotic molecules was observed in CD LPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present work, we aimed to analyse the effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of 5-amino <z:chebi fb="4" ids="16914">salicylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>) and derivatives on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of LPL and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in patients with CD compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and in non-inflammatory controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PBL and LPL were isolated by Ficoll-Hypopaque gradient centrifugation and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30740">EGTA</z:chebi>-collagenase method, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PBL/LPL were stimulated with FasL, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="132842">sulphapyridine</z:chebi>, and sulphasalazine for 24/48 hours and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was quantified by flow cytometry (annexin V- <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> method) and immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanisms of drug induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were analysed in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and FADD-/- Jurkat T cells using western blots and caspase assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: While PBL displayed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> pattern after Fas stimulation in patients with active CD, LPL from inflammatory areas were highly resistant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparable resistance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was observed in LPL of UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>, which did not induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in lymphocytes, sulphasalazine proved to be a potent proapoptotic agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sulphasalazine induced T lymphocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was independent of the Fas pathway but associated with marked downregulation of antiapoptotic bcl-xl and bcl2, activation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> signalling pathway, and subsequent activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The beneficial effect of sulphasalazine in treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> is at least in part attributable to its proapoptotic effects on LPL which allows potent downregulation of lymphocyte activation </plain></SENT>
