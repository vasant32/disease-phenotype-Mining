<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Fascin is associated with increased cell motility in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumours</z:e> but is absent from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the expression of fascin in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) and its location at regions undergoing restitution and regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tissue repair is essential for disease remission and we sought to determine the effects of therapeutic modalities on fascin expression and function using an in vitro model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was performed on colonic tissue from IBD patients to determine changes in fascin expression and distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A human colorectal epithelial cell line was treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="20551">5-aminosalicylate</z:chebi> (a common treatment for IBD), or <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> to determine the effect on fascin expression and cell motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fascin overexpression was observed in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and expression correlated with disease severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity was more intense and widespread in Crohn's compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, highly expressing foci were consistently observed at the edges of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> where flattened, motile epithelial cells are actively involved in restitution, and also in areas of mucosal regeneration.<z:chebi fb="0" ids="20551">5-aminosalicylate</z:chebi> reduced fascin expression in colorectal epithelial cells and inhibited their motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conversely, <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> increased fascin expression and stimulated cell motility in the same cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data shows that fascin is overexpressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> and its location is indicative of a role in tissue repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our in vitro studies show that different therapeutic modalities may have converse effects on fascin expression and may have significant consequences for disease remission and the clinical management of IBD </plain></SENT>
