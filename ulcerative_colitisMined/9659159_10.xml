<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stopping smoking often precedes <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Smoking reduces the 24 hour urine excretion of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">chromium-51</z:chebi> labelled EDTA in healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To estimate the effects of smoking on the urine excretion of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi> EDTA in well characterised patients with UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Sixteen smoking and 16 non-smoking patients with UC in remission were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The non-smokers had never smoked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most were taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patient took steroids or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The control group comprised 25 smoking healthy volunteers and 25 who had never smoked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median cigarette consumption was equal in the patients and volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The 24 hour urine excretion of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi> EDTA was measured and the results were correlated with smoking habits, number of cigarettes, and disease extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with UC had significantly higher 24 hour urine recoveries than healthy controls (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This difference was more pronounced when patients who smoked were compared with healthy smokers (p = 0.005) No significant differences were found when comparing non-smoking patients with non-smoking controls or when comparing smoking and non-smoking patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Urine recoveries did not correlate with number of cigarettes or disease extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Smoking was more prevalent in patients with a more limited disease extent (p = 0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Effects of smoking on the urine excretion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi> EDTA in health were abolished by the presence of UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The protective effects of smoking in established UC are not due to a moderating effect of smoking on intestinal permeability </plain></SENT>
