<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our experiments were designed to identify dysregulation of epithelial junctional molecules in the IBD intestinum and to address whether altered expression of these molecules is a primary event in IBD or a phenomenon secondary to the inflammatory process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Noninflamed and inactively and actively inflamed mucosal tissues from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> as well as tissues from control subjects were analyzed for the expression of junctional molecules by different methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Marked downregulation of junctional proteins and their respective <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> was observed in actively inflamed IBD tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In IBD tissues with inactive <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, only a few junctional molecules such as E-cadherin and alpha-catenin were affected, whereas expression of desmosomal or tight junction-associated proteins appeared almost unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In noninflamed IBD tissues, junctional protein expression was not different from that seen in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In IBD, downregulation of junctional molecule expression is apparently associated with the inflammatory process and does not likely represent a primary phenomenon </plain></SENT>
