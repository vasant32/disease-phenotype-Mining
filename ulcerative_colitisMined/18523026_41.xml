<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Genome-wide expression study (41,058 expression sequence tags, 215 biopsies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, UK, and Genentech, San Francisco, USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 67 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 31 control subjects (23 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and 8 patients with inflamed non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> biopsies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Paired endoscopic biopsies were taken from 5 specific anatomical locations for <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> extraction and histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Agilent microarray platform was used and confirmation of results was undertaken by real time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In healthy control biopsies, cluster analysis showed differences in gene expression between the right and left colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(chi(2) = 25.1, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Developmental genes, homeobox protein A13 (HOXA13), (p = 2.3x10(-16)), HOXB13 (p&lt;1x10(-45)), <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo>-associated oncogene 1 (GLI1) (p = 4.0x10(-24)), and GLI3 (p = 2.1x10(-28)) primarily drove this separation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> biopsies and control biopsies were compared, 143 sequences had a fold change of &gt;1.5 in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> biopsies (0.01&gt;p&gt;10(-45)) and 54 sequences had a fold change of &lt;-1.5 (0.01&gt;p&gt;10(-20)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Differentially upregulated genes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> included serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) (p&lt;10(-45)) the alpha defensins 5 and 6 (DEFA5 and 6) (p = 0.00003 and p = 6.95x10(-7), respectively), matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3) (p = 5.6x10(-10)) and MMP7 (p = 2.3x10(-7)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Increased DEFA5 and 6 expression was further characterised to Paneth cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sub-analysis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> 2 (IBD2) and IBD5 loci, and the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter genes revealed a number of differentially regulated genes in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Key findings are the expression gradient in the healthy adult colon and the involvement of novel gene families, as well as established candidate genes in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
