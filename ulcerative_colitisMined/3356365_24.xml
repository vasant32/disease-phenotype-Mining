<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased frequency of defecation (83%), urgency (85%), a feeling of incomplete evacuation (78%) and tenesmus (63%) were the most frequent symptoms experienced by patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were significantly more common (p less than 0.001) in patients with active than quiescent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and their prevalence was similar in those with total and distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, indicating that these symptoms are related to an inflamed and irritable distal colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty seven per cent of patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> voided hard stools indicative of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo>, however, and this was more common in active, than quiescent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This feature is probably secondary to faecal stasis in the proximal colon, and an apt description of the bowel disturbance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, irrespective of the extent of disease is that the colon suffers from proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> and distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
