<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mucosal healing (MH) is considered an important therapeutic goal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluate the severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> and clarify the relation between MH and long-term outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study group comprised 38 patients with UC in clinical remission on total colonoscopy who were followed up for at least 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical remission was defined as a Mayo score of 0 for both stool frequency and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopic findings were evaluated into 4 grades according to the Mayo endoscopic subscore (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During clinical remission, the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> was 0 in only 24% of the patients, 1 in 40%, 2 in 26%, and 3 in 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six percent of the patients thus had active disease on colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After initial colonoscopy, the cumulative rate of remission maintenance was 100% in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> 0, 1 in 93%, 2 in 70%, and 3 in 50% at 6 months and 78%, 40%, 10%, and 0%, respectively, at 5 years (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Many patients with UC in clinical remission have active lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with a higher <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> have a higher rate of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>To improve long-term outcomes, an <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> of 0 should be the treatment goal </plain></SENT>
