<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> (PSC) requires invasive procedures such as liver biopsy and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sonographic measurement of fasting gall bladder volume, which has been reported to be enlarged in PSC, could serve as a non-invasive screening test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fasting gall bladder volume was studied in patients with PSC (n = 24), primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002613'>biliary cirrhosis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PBC</z:e>, n = 13), liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> due to other causes (n = 18), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (n = 15), and healthy controls (n = 23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Meal induced gall bladder emptying was studied in patients with PSC, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PBC</z:e>, and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients with PSC gall bladder volume was greatly enlarged (72.9 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> 3.7) ml) compared with healthy controls (25.4 (1.7) ml, and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PBC</z:e> (30.9 (2.7) ml), liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> (31.3 (4.0) ml) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (25.8 (2.0) ml) (p &lt; 0.0005 v <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In four patients with PSC the gall bladder wall was irregularly thickened (&gt; 4 mm) as previously described in PSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postprandial residual fractions (% of fasting volume) were comparable between patients with PSC (17.5 (3.7)%) and those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PBC</z:e> (23.6 (7.1%) and healthy controls (12.7 (2.3)%) Although gall bladder emptying seems <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, increased biliary pressure in patients with PSC cannot be excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Apart from wall thickening, patients with PSC often present with enlargement of the gall bladder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sonographic determination of fasting gall bladder volume may be a useful, non-invasive, and easy to perform tool in the evaluation of patients suspected of having PSC </plain></SENT>
