<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was assessed by standard clinical and laboratory tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Haemolytic E coli were isolated from 18% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 24% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and 11% of healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of these differences was significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No verotoxin producing strains were detected among the 216 E coli isolates examined but the extract from five strains (Crohn's (4), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (1) produced a distinctive cytopathic effort on Vero cell monolayers which was later shown not to be due to verotoxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> indices of E coli isolates cultured were: mean (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) 42.2 (6.4) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 43.3 (6.2) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and 11.3 (2.0) for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (p less than or equal to 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adhesive E coli were isolated from 62% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and 68% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> but from only 6% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (p less than or equal to 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither haemolysin production nor enteroadherence was dependent upon disease activity, disease location, sulphasalazine treatment, or previous intestinal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that only enteroadherent E coli were frequently associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>; their relation to the pathogenesis of these conditions, however, remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
