<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against TNF-alpha, is efficacious in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its main mechanism of action is thought to be the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluates in detail the effects of infliximab on the TNF-alpha system using peripheral blood monocytes and T cells as well as lamina propria lymphocytes from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and patients with CD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes were studied in the resting state in the absence of strong stimuli that may obscure subtle findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Infliximab did not change the numbers of viable cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rather, it caused monocytes to increase their release of soluble TNFR2, which serves to neutralize TNF-alpha, potentiating the action of infliximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It reduced TNFR2 expression, thereby decreasing TNF-alpha responsiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These changes were due to upregulated production of TNFR2 rather than increased shedding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Infliximab did not cause rebound production of TNF-alpha transcripts that would counteract its effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It specifically enhanced production of IL-10 but not proinflammatory cytokines secreted by leukocytes, thereby promoting an anti-inflammatory microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, infliximab caused a rise in c-Jun amino-terminal kinase phosphorylation by monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus infliximab manipulates the TNF-alpha system to promote its anti-TNF-alpha effects </plain></SENT>
