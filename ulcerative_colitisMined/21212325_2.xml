<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite an increasing interest in bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) signaling in gut pathologies, little is known of the specific roles played by individual Smads in intestinal epithelial functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we generated a mouse model with deletion of Smad5 transcriptional effector of the Bmp signaling pathway exclusively in the intestinal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Proliferation, migration, and apical junctional complex (AJC) protein expression were analyzed by immunofluorescence and Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Human intestinal biopsies from control and IBD patients were analyzed for SMAD5 gene transcript expression by quantitative PCR (qPCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Smad5(ΔIEC) and control mice were subjected to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34674">dextran sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (DSS)-induced experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, and their clinical and histological symptoms were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Loss of Smad5 led to intestinal epithelial hypermigration and deregulation of the expression of claudin-1 and claudin-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>E-cadherin was found to be equally expressed but displaced from the AJC to the cytoplasm in Smad5(ΔIEC) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of SMAD5 gene expression in human IBD patient samples revealed a significant downregulation of the gene transcript in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Smad5(ΔIEC) mice exposed to experimental DSS <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> were significantly more susceptible to the disease and had <z:mp ids='MP_0001792'>impaired wound healing</z:mp> during the recovery phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results support that Smad5 is partly responsible for mediating Bmp signals in intestinal epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, deficiency in epithelial Smad5 leads to the deregulation of cell migration by disassembling the AJC with increasing susceptibility to experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and impairment in wound healing </plain></SENT>
