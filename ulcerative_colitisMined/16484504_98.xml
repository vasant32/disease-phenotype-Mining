<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with refractory active UC were randomly assigned to a high trough concentration (10-15 ng/ml) group (HT group) (n = 21), low trough concentration (5-10 ng/ml) group (LT group) (n = 22), or placebo group (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients received an initial oral dose of 0.025 [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] mg/kg tacrolimus or placebo twice daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Efficacy was evaluated in 60 patients based on a disease activity index (DAI) score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty eight patients had additional treatment with tacrolimus and were evaluated for efficacy in a 10 week open label extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An improvement in DAI score (&gt;or=4 points, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> categories improved) was observed for 68.4% of cases in the HT group compared with 10.0% in the placebo group (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the HT group, 20.0% of patients had clinical remission and 78.9% had mucosal healing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the open label extension, 55.2% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had an improved DAI score at week 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean dose of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> was reduced from 19.7 mg/day at study entry to 7.8 mg/day at week 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of side effects in the HT group was significantly higher than that of the placebo group (p = 0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common event was mild finger <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate dose dependent efficacy and safety of oral tacrolimus for remission-induction therapy of refractory UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The optimal target range appears to be 10-15 ng/ml in terms of efficacy with two week therapy </plain></SENT>
