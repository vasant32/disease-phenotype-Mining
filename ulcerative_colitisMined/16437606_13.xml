<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the efficacy, safety, and feasibility of a granulocyte adsorptive type apheresis system for the treatment of patients with chronically active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> despite standard therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An open label multicenter study was carried out in 39 patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (CAI 6-8) despite continuous use of steroids (a minimum total dose of 400 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> within the last 4 wk) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients received a total of five aphereses using a granulocyte adsorptive technique (Adacolumn (reg), Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe, UK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Assessments at wk 6 and during follow-up until 4 mo comprised clinical (CAI) and endoscopic (EI) activity index, histology, quality of life (IBDQ), and laboratory tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-five out of thirty-nine patients were qualified for intent-to-treat analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the apheresis treatment at wk 6, 13/35 (37.1%) patients achieved clinical remission and 10/35 (28.6%) patients had endoscopic remission (CAI&lt;4, EI&lt;4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quality of life (IBDQ) increased significantly (24 points, P&lt;0.01) at wk 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Apheresis could be performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aphereses were well tolerated, only one patient experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with steroid refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, five aphereses with a granulocyte/monocyte depleting filter show potential short-term efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Tolerability and technical feasibility of the procedure are excellent </plain></SENT>
