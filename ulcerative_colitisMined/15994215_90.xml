<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The General Practice Research Database (GPRD) which contains the primary care records of five million people in the UK was used to identify users of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi>, balsalazide, olsalazine, or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">sulfasalazine</z:chebi> with a history of IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a nested case control analysis, each incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> case with any use of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> in the six months before the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis was matched by age, sex, and calendar time to six control patients who were also currently using a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were then classified according to regularity of use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The analysis was controlled for body mass index, IBD duration, history of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="58" ids="46195">paracetamol</z:chebi>, aspirin, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi>, oral and rectal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi>, prior gastrointestinal hospitalisation, recorded colonoscopy, and number of visits to the general practitioner for IBD symptoms in the 6-24 months before diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study population included 18 969 patients, of whom 100 had developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most of these cases had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (76 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the case control analysis, regular users, defined as having six or more <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> prescriptions in the previous 12 months, were found to have a decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> compared with irregular users (crude odds ratio (OR) 0.7 (0.44-1.03); adjusted OR 0.60 (0.38-0.96)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regular users of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">sulfasalazine</z:chebi> with 6-12 prescriptions before had an adjusted OR of 0.95 (0.22-4.11); with 13-30 prior prescriptions this was 0.41 (0.14-1.20) and with &gt;30 prior prescriptions this was 0.77 (0.37-1.60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> users, these values were 1.13 (0.49-2.59), 0.30 (0.11-0.83), and 0.31 (0.11-0.84), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results show that regular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> use is associated with some reduction in the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> developing in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
