<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intradermal tests were frequently positive, especially to casein, but the results did not differ from those found in healthy individuals and in groups of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, hypolactasia, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022104" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IBS">irritable colon syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No circulating IgE-specific antibodies to the milk proteins were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An increased frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857523" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atopic diseases</z:e> was found in patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (15.7%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (13.3%) compared with the findings in a control group (1.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that, if an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0869403,C0700625,C0020517" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">allergy</z:e> to milk proteins is a factor in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, it is not mediated by reaginic antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is possible, however, that the frequent occurrence of atopy indicates a susceptibility to develop reaginic responses even though this mechanism does not apply to the milk proteins </plain></SENT>
