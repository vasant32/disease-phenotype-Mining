<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In contrast with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects where IgA is the main immunoglobulin in the intestine, patients with active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) produce high concentrations of IgG from intestinal lymphocytes, but the antigens at which these antibodies are directed are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the specificities of these antibodies mucosal immunoglobulins were isolated from washings taken at endoscopy from 21 control patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022104" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IBS">irritable bowel syndrome</z:e>, 10 control patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, and 51 patients with IBD: 24 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD, 15 active, nine quiescent), 27 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC, 20 active, seven inactive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total mucosal IgG was much higher (p &lt; 0.001) in active UC (median 512 micrograms/ml) and active CD (256 micrograms/ml) than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022104" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IBS">irritable bowel syndrome</z:e> controls (1.43 micrograms/ml), but not significantly different from controls with non-IBD <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> (224 micrograms/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mucosal IgG bound to proteins of a range of non-pathogenic commensal faecal bacteria in active CD; this was higher than in UC (p &lt; 0.01); and both were significantly greater than controls with non-IBD <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> (CD p &lt; 0.001, UC p &lt; 0.01) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> (p &lt; 0.001 CD and UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This mucosal IgG binding was shown on western blots and by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to be principally directed against the <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> cytoplasmic rather than the membrane proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total mucosal IgA concentrations did not differ between IBD and controls, but the IgA titres against faecal bacteria were lower in UC than controls (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These experiments show that there is an exaggerated mucosal immune response particularly in active CD but also in UC directed against cytoplasmic proteins of bacteria within the intestinal lumen; this implies that in relapse of IBD there is a breakdown of tolerance to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> commensal flora of the gut </plain></SENT>
