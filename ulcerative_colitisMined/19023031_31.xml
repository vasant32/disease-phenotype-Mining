<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its role in tissue regeneration is less understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that Notch signaling is activated in a greater number of intestinal epithelial cells in the inflamed mucosa of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of Notch activation in vivo using a gamma-secretase inhibitor resulted in a severe exacerbation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> attributable to the loss of the regenerative response within the epithelial layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Activation of Notch supported epithelial regeneration by suppressing goblet cell differentiation, but it also promoted cell proliferation, as shown in in vivo and in vitro studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By utilizing <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi>-dependent gene expression and microarray analysis, we identified a novel group of genes that are regulated downstream of Notch1 within intestinal epithelial cells, including PLA2G2A, an antimicrobial <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> secreted by Paneth cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, we show that these functions of activated Notch1 are present in the mucosa of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, mediating cell proliferation, goblet cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath>, and ectopic expression of PLA2G2A, thereby contributing to the regeneration of the damaged epithelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study showed the critical involvement of Notch signaling during intestinal tissue regeneration, regulating differentiation, proliferation, and antimicrobial response of the epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus Notch signaling is a key intracellular molecular pathway for the proper reconstruction of the intestinal epithelia </plain></SENT>
