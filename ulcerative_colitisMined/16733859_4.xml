<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a prospective, IRB-approved protocol, p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> was determined in 80 patients with UC (mean age, 32 +/- 12.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The severity and extension of disease were determined by clinical methods, searching a statistical association with p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> were detected in 41 (51%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Severity of disease was the only clinical variable statistically associated with their presence (P &lt; 0.0001; OR = 9; CI 95% = 3.2-24.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> was similar to that reported in other countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their presence was associated to UC severity, but offered no more information than the obtained by clinical methods </plain></SENT>
