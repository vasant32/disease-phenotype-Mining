<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> human leucocyte elastase levels were raised significantly above <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> when the disease was active, and fell on remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean human leucocyte elastase level in 31 cases of active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> was significantly greater than the mean human leucocyte elastase level in 23 patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (p = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The values of human leucocyte elastase correlated significantly with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> activity index scores (p = 0.05) and with the circulating concentration of C-reactive protein (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> respectively), but not with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the concentration of human leucocyte elastase in the plasma of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> reflects the activity of their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal disease</z:e> and suggest that serial measurements of human leucocyte elastase may be useful in the assessment and clinical management of these conditions </plain></SENT>
