<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> there is a slight rise in the number of mast cells and it appears that these participate in the inflammatory process in a non-specific manner; the number of IgE-containing immunocytes is not significantly altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> there is an almost total absence of stainable mast cells in affected areas of the bowel, together with a marked decrease in IgE-containing immunocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that these findings are due to degranulation of mast cells and consumption of IgE as a result of an immediate hypersensitivity reaction in the bowel wall, this being one component of the protein inflammatory and immunological response to the entry of a variety of antigenic material </plain></SENT>
