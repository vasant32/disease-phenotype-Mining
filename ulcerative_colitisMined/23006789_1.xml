<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective analysis of insurance claims from June 1997 to August 2006 in the LifeLink Database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient criteria: aged 18 or older with one or more claim(s) between June 1997 and August 2005 for a UC diagnosis and at least one oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> prescription on or after the first observed UC diagnosis; continuous enrollment for at least 6 months prior to and 12 months following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> initiation (index date) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a proxy for active disease, patients needed to have at least two UC-specific non-pharmacy claims, at least 30 days of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> treatment and at least one <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> prescription within the 12-month post-index period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cumulative exposure to oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASAs</z:chebi> over the 12-month period was calculated using the medication possession ratio (MPR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with an MPR of at least 0.80 were classified as adherent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>-cause medical and pharmacy resource utilization and costs were computed over the 12-month post-index period and compared between adherent and nonadherent patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 1,693 UC patients met study inclusion criteria: 72% were nonadherent to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> treatment (n=1,217) and 28% were adherent (n=476) in the 12-month study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with nonadherent patients, adherent patients had 31% fewer hospitalizations (P=0.0025) and 34% fewer emergency department admissions (P=0.0016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adherent patients had 25% more pharmacy prescriptions overall (P &lt;0.0001) and 71% more UC-related pharmacy prescriptions (P &lt;0.0001) than did nonadherent patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Total <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause health care utilization was 1.13 times higher for adherent patients than for nonadherent patients (P=0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for covariates, total <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause costs were 29% higher for nonadherent patients than for adherent patients (mean [95% confidence interval]: $13,465 [$13,094, $13,835] vs $17,339 [$17,033, $17,645]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Approximately three-quarters of patients with active UC were not adherent with their prescribed doses of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nonadherence was associated with higher total <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The key driver of decreased costs among adherent patients was inpatient hospitalizations, which more than offset these patients' expected higher pharmacy costs </plain></SENT>
