<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the in vitro effects of oxpentifylline (pentoxifylline; PTX; a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50218">phosphodiesterase inhibitor</z:chebi>) on inflammatory cytokine production (1) by peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and (2) by inflamed intestinal mucosa cultures from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PBMCs and mucosal biopsy specimens were cultured for 24 hours in the absence or presence of PTX (up to 100 micrograms/ml), and the secretion of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8 determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PTX inhibited the release of TNF-alpha by PBMCs from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> and the secretion of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta by organ cultures of inflamed mucosa from the same patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secretion of TNF-alpha by PBMCs was inhibited by about 50% at a PTX concentration of 25 micrograms/ml (IC50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PTX was equally potent in cultures from controls, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, and those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 were not significantly modified in PBMCs, but IL-6 increased slightly in organ culture supernatants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PTX or more potent related compounds may represent a new family of cytokine inhibitors, potentially interesting for treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
