<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) is characterised by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and refractory <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> complising <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) in main </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inhibitory natural killer receptors (iNKRs) are expressed on NK cells, involved in NK-cell tolerance to self </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is increasing evidence that iNKRs like NKG2A expressed on T cells are importantly involved in the regulation of immune responses though no studies have addressed the potential role in the pathogenesis of IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analysed the expression of NKG2A on T cells in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34674">dextran sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (DSS)-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> model mouse and IBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male BALB/c mice were administrated 5% DSS in distilled water for 7 days ad libitum for induction of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For controls, age-matched BALB/c mice were given distilled water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NKG2A+ T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs) were analysed by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For histological analysis of DSS-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> mice, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin (HandE) staining and immunohistochemistry were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For blocking experiments using antibody (Ab), mice were intraperitoneally injected with 300 Âµg of anti-NKG2A monoclonal Ab or control IgG after oral administration of 5% DSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PBMCs samples from 23 healthy controls, 20 UC and 16 CD patients were analysed by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Tissue sections from 7 controls, 6 UC and 5 CD patients were subjected to histological analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Data were evaluated using the Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney U-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the active phase of DSS-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> mouse, the frequency of NKG2A+ T cells was significantly decreased in the peripheral blood and increased in the intestine, suggesting the mobilisation of this T cell subset to the sites of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Administration of anti-NKG2A Ab increased the number of inflammatory foci in DSS-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, suggesting the involvement of NKG2A+ T cells in this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In UC patients, the frequency of NKG2A+ T cells in PBMCs was significantly decreased, compared with CD patients and healthy controls, regardless of clinical conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Notably, in sharp contrast to the DSS-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> mouse, the frequency of NKG2A+ cells in LPMCs was also decreased in UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that inadequate local infiltration of NKG2A+ T cells may be involved in the pathogenesis of UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrates the frequency of NKG2A+ T cells is decreased in both PBMCs and LPMCs in UC patients, implicating this T cell subset as a potential therapeutic target for UC </plain></SENT>
