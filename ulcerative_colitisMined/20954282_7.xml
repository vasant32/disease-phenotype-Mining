<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine the relationship of pulmonary abnormalities and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel disease</z:e> activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients, and 20 control subjects were enrolled in this prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Detailed clinical information was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Extent and activity of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel disease</z:e> were established endoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each patient underwent pulmonary function tests and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood samples for measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), angiotensin converting enzyme and total IgE were delivered by the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten (25.6%) patients had respiratory symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A pulmonary function abnormality was present in 22 of 39 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, the most prevalent abnormalities in lung functions were a decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow (FEF) 25%-75%, transfer coefficient for <z:chebi fb="168" ids="17245">carbon monoxide</z:chebi> (DLCO), DLCO/alveolar volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased respiratory symptoms score was associated with high endoscopic activity index in UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic and clinical activities in UC patients were correlated with FEV1, FEV1/FVC, and FEF 25%-75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Smoking status, duration of disease and medication were not correlated with pulmonary physiological test results, HRCT abnormalities, clinical/endoscopic disease activity, CRP, ESR or total IgE level or body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is important that respiratory manifestations are recognized and treated early in IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, they can lead to destructive and irreversible changes in the airway wall </plain></SENT>
