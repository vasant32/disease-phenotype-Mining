<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the use of soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) and sTfR-ferritin (sTfR-F) index in the evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred IBD patients [49 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), 51 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD)] and 102 healthy controls were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of ferritin, transferrin saturation and sTfR were analyzed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>sTfR-F index was calculated based on the ratio: sTfR/ log ferritin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The value of sTfR and sTfR-F for diagnosis of IDA was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty two IBD patients (41% of UC and 42.9 % of CD) fulfilled the WHO criteria for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among them thirty (30 %) had IDA, four (4%) had ACD and eight (8%) had mixed IDA/ACD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with IDA had significantly higher sTfR and sTfR-F index levels compared with those without IDA (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both sTfR and sTfR-F index were not correlated with CRP levels or disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>High sTfR levels (&gt;1.8 mg/L) had sensitivity 81% and specificity 80%, whereas high sTfR-F index (&gt;1.4) had sensitivity 91% and specificity 92% for the diagnosis of IDA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the sTfR-F index seems to be very efficient in the detection and diagnosis of IDA, among patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
