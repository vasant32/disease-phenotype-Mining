<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Despite the predominance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849867" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">extensive disease</z:e> in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, data concerning severe paediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> are sparse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed rates and predictors of response to intravenous-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy in a single-centre cohort with long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 99 children (49% males; age 2-17 years) were hospitalised (1991-2000) for treatment of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (90% extensive; 49% new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical, laboratory and radiographic data were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A population-based subset was used to assess incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Predictors of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> response were analysed using univariate and multivariate analyses at days 3 and 5 of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Colectomy rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 28% (95% CI, 23 to 34%) of children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> resident in the Greater Toronto Area required admission for intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy, of whom 53 (53%; 95% CI, 44 to 63%) responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Several predictors were associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> failure, but in multivariable modelling only C-reactive protein [OR = 3.5 (1.4 to 8.4)] and number of nocturnal stools [OR = 3.2 (1.6 to 6.6)] remained significant at both days 3 and 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative Colitis</z:hpo> Activity Index (PUCAI), Travis and Lindgren's indices strongly predicted non-response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Radiographically, the upper range of colonic <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> width was 40 mm in children younger than 11 years versus 60 mm in older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cumulative colectomy rates at discharge, 1 year and 6 years were 42%, 58% and 61%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> commonly experience at least one severe exacerbation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Response to intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> is poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The PUCAI, determined at day 3 (&gt;45 points) should be used to screen for patients likely to fail <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and at day 5 (&gt;70 points) to dictate the introduction of second-line therapies </plain></SENT>
