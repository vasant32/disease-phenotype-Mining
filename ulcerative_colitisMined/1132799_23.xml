<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, the macroscopic and histological appearances resembled those encountered elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract and their incidence was related to the activity of the disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lesions in the other two groups were different macroscopically and histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Production of salivary IgA was found to be reduced in Crohn's patients with active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the occurrence of oral lesions in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> might represent a local immunological reaction to oral antigens </plain></SENT>
