<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The affected bowel is rapidly restored to normality by reanastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diversion <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> should not be mistaken for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, for which reanastomosis would be inappropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studies of biopsy material from patients with diversion <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> have shown a variety of histological features, but no consistent pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The histology in resection specimens of defunctioned large bowel from 15 patients with no pre-existing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> or rectal discharge of blood or mucus that developed between 9 months and 17 years after diversion procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The histology was abnormal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Findings were similar in 14 patients, regardless of the duration of faecal diversion, and comprised diffuse mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> with or without mild crypt architectural abnormalities, <z:mp ids='MP_0000491'>crypt abscesses</z:mp>, or follicular <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These features in biopsy specimens are unlikely to be diagnostic but should provide useful information in avoiding a mistaken diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> in these patients </plain></SENT>
