<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the trends in the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) over 23 years in the same area and to identify genetic factors related to incidence evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with IBD arising from North-western Greece were systematically recorded through the 1983-2005 period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Trends in disease incidence and genetic patterns related to CARD15 variants were documented and correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 447 patients with IBD were recorded (23.5% <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 72.7% <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 3.8% indeterminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean annual incidence rates of CD and UC were 0.9/100,000 (95% CI 0.1-1.7) and 2.7/100,000 (95% CI 1.7-4.1) inhabitants, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant increase of CD incidence (P&lt;0.01) during the study period, in contrast to the UC incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no statistical differences in CARD15 variants over the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The incidence of CD in North-western Greece has risen disproportionately to that of UC in the 21st century </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is not related to alterations of genetic background though </plain></SENT>
