<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) is to be understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The basic pathological feature of UC is intestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Superantigen, such as Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB), is reported to compromise intestinal barrier function by increasing epithelial permeability and initiate <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the intestinal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inasmuch as anatomic position of the sinus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011109'>chronic sinusitis</z:hpo>-derived SEB may follow the secretion and to be swallowed down to the gastrointestinal tract and induce lesions to the intestinal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sinus wash fluid (SWF, containing SEB) was collected from a group of patients with both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011109'>chronic sinusitis</z:hpo> (CS) and UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A group of mice were sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA) in the presence of SWF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitized mice were challenged with the specific antigen OVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The inflammatory status of the colonic tissue was determined with histology, serology and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as a tracer, another group of mice was stimulated with SWF for 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The HRP activity was detected in the colonic tissue with enzymatic approaches and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Epithelial hyperpermeability in colonic epithelium was induced by stimulating with SWF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The HRP activity in the colonic mucosa was almost 11 times more in the SWF treated group (3.2 +/- 0.6 microg/g tissue) than the control group (0.3 +/- 0.1 microg/g tissue) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mice were sensitized using a mixture of SWF and OVA (serum OVA-specific IgE was detected with a highest titer as 1:64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Challenge with OVA induced extensive <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the colonic mucosa by showing (1) marked degranulation in mast cells (MC, 46.3 +/- 4.5%) and eosinophils (Eo, 55.7 +/- 4.2%); (2) inflammatory cell infiltration (MC = 145.2 +/- 11.4; Eo = 215.8 +/- 12.5; mononuclear cell = 258.4 +/- 15.3/mm2 tissue); (3) increased MPO activity (12.9 +/- 3.2 U/g tissue) and inflammatory scores (1.8 +/- 0.3); (4) mucosal surface <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>; (5) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in the lamina propria; (6) <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> translocation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> formation in the subepithelial region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Introducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>Sinusitis</z:hpo>-derived SEB-containing SWF to the gastrointestinal tract compromised colonic mucosal barrier function increasing epithelial permeability to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> macromolecular protein in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The SWF facilitated colonic mucosal sensitization to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Multiple challenging the sensitized colonic mucosa with specific antigen OVA induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, induced a condition similar to human <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
