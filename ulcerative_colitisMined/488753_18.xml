<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Of 111 <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> developing in 73 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, 46 (41.5%) arose in the rectum where they are directly accessible to sigmoidoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight per cent of single <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> developed in the rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The extent and frequency of rectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was assessed by examining slides of rectal mucosa with an eyepiece micrometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Slides from 46 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and 22 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> but no <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in whom proctectomy or proctocolectomy had been carried out were examined by this method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of 15 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the colon (87%) and 21/22 patients (95%) with large bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> showed evidence only of rectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there was marked variability in the proportion of dysplastic rectal mucosa even in those patients with rectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, while in some patients <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was limited to a small focus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because of the possibility of false negative biopsies due to sampling error, multiple biopsies should be taken to detect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their state should be recorded and deliberately varied at subsequent visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Careful sigmoidoscopy and multiple biopsies in this study had potential value as an aid in the detection of 85-90% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In practice the figure would almost certainly be lower due to intrinsic bias (see discussion) so that, although regular sigmoidoscopy and biopsy would be of great value when colonoscopy is not available, the latter should be included in any long-term programme of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> prevention </plain></SENT>
