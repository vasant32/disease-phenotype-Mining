<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> of Sprague-Dawley rats was induced by intrarectal infusion of 1 mL 5% (v/v) <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after exposed to <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi>, rats were divided into three experimental groups: control group, attenuated Salmonella typhimurium Ty21a strain (SP) group and SP strain carrying human KGF gene (SPK) group, and they were separately administered orally with 10% NaHCO(3), SP or SPK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were sacrificed and colonic tissues were harvested respectively on day 3, 5, 7 and 10 after administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Weights of rats, colonic weight/length ratio and stool score were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological changes of colonic tissues were examined by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin (HE) staining method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of KGF, KGF receptor (KGFR) and TNF-α were measured either by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the cellular localization of KGFR and Ki67 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) contents in the homogenate were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Body weight and colonic weight/length ratio were declined in SPK group compared with SP and control groups (body weight: 272.78 ± 17.92 g vs 243.72 ± 14.02 g and 240.68 ± 12.63 g, P &lt; 0.01; colonic weight/length ratio: 115.76 ± 7.47 vs 150.32 ± 5.99 and 153.67 ± 5.50 mg/cm, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, pathological changes of damaged colon were improved in SPK group as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After administration of SPK strain, KGF expression increased markedly from the 3rd d, and remained at a high level till the 10th d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, KGFR expression and Ki67 expression elevated, whereas TNF-α expression was inhibited in SPK group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the group administered with SPK, SOD activity increased significantly (d 5: 26.18 ± 5.84 vs 18.12 ± 3.30 and 18.79 ± 4.74 U/mg, P &lt; 0.01; d 7: 35.48 ± 3.35 vs 22.57 ± 3.44 and 21.69 ± 3.94 U/mg, P &lt; 0.01; d 10: 46.10 ± 6.23 vs 25.35 ± 4.76 and 27.82 �� 6.42 U/mg, P &lt; 0.01) and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> contents decreased accordingly (d 7: 7.40 ± 0.88 vs 9.81 ± 1.21 and 10.45 ± 1.40 nmol/mg, P &lt; 0.01; d 10: 4.36 ± 0.62 vs 8.41 ± 0.92 and 8.71 ± 1.27 nmol/mg, P &lt; 0.01), compared with SP and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: KGF gene therapy mediated by attenuated Salmonella ameliorates <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> induced by <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acids</z:chebi>, and it may be a safe and effective treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
