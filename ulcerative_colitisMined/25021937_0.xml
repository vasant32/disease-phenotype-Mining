<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">Immunosuppressants</z:chebi> (IS) and biologics carry risks of severe side effects and patients may not respond </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of of Granulocyte, Monocyte/Macrophage adsorptive (GMA) apheresis with Adacolumn® is supported by an increasing number of randomised controlled trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study intended to generate further data to document efficacy and identify subpopulations of refractory UC that may benefit from GMA apheresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was an uncontrolled, open-label, multicenter trial conducted in the UK, France and Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consecutive eligible patients (age &gt;18 &lt;75 years) with steroid-dependent active UC, a Rachmilewitz (CAI) index ≥6, an Endoscopic Activity Index (EAI) ≥4, and insufficient response or intolerance to IS and/or biologicals were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients received at least 5 weekly GMA aphereses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Evaluation visits were planned at Week 12, 24 and 48 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the remission rate (CAI ≤4) at Week 12 in the Intention-to-treat (ITT) population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We report interim results from the 12 Week visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ITT population comprised 84 enrolled and treated patients at cutoff date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At Week 12, 33 (39.3%) subjects had achieved remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For 30 patients with prior failure of IS and/or biologicals, the remission rate was 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Secondary efficacy parameters were clinical response with reduction in CAI of ≥3 (47 or 55.9%), steroid-free remission (23%) and steroid-free response (36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In remitters, EAI dropped from 8.2 to 4.4; in responders from 8.6 to 5.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Quality of Life improved in parallel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Most subjects had Adverse Events (AEs) of mild or moderate intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Six (7.1%) of 85 subjects in the Safety Population experienced serious (SAEs), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in the treatment-emergent period; however none was considered related to study treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>No new safety signals were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study describes a larger cohort of steroid-dependent moderate-severe active UC patients intolerant or refractory to IS and/or biologicals treated with GMA apheresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Apheresis was safe and showed benefit in over half of these patients and remission in 39.3% at week 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Leukocyte aphaeresis (Adacolumn) for IBD has been reviewed by NICE as suitable for carefully selected patients with IBD, and these results help define this sub-group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Further controlled studies are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>DISCLOSURE OF INTEREST: None Declared </plain></SENT>
