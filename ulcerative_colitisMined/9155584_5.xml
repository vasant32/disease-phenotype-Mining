<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCAs</z:chebi> with a perinuclear pattern of immunofluorescence are found in most patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, but several findings are against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCAs</z:chebi> having a pathogenetic role in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To evaluate the influence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCAs</z:chebi> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> on the respiratory burst activity of neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Serum samples were obtained from 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, seven of whom showed positivity for p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCAs</z:chebi>, three patients with vasculitidis, two with positivity for p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCAs</z:chebi>, and one for c-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCAs</z:chebi>, and seven healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A positive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> serology was determined with a standard indirect immunofluorescence assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Purified immunoglobulins (IgGs) were prepared from serum samples by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52153">DEAE</z:chebi>-Affigel blue chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Human neutrophils were prepared by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi>-Ficoll-Hypaque separation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">Superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="38" ids="18421,29356">O2-</z:chebi>.) generation was measured by following the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase inhibitable reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15719">ferricytochrome</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences among samples from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> IgG p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> positive, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> IgG p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> negative patients, and controls on <z:chebi fb="38" ids="18421,29356">O2-</z:chebi>. production, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> positive IgG from vasculitidis significantly enhanced <z:chebi fb="38" ids="18421,29356">O2-</z:chebi>. release (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCAs</z:chebi> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> have no effect on the respiratory burst activity of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human neutrophils in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results reinforce the hypotheses that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCAs</z:chebi> are unlikely to contribute to the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
