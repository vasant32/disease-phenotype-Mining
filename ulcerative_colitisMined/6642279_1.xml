<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Systemic turnover and regional exchange of free fatty acid were evaluated using intravenous infusion of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-labelled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> measurements were made in the postabsorptive, overnight fasted state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arterial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations were 10% lower in the patients but net splanchnic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output was similar in patients and controls </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arterial amino acid concentrations were generally reduced but net splanchnic amino acid uptake was the same in patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Arterial concentrations of free fatty acid and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi> as well as systemic and fractional turnover were similar in patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients' splanchnic uptake of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi> was increased more than three fold in comparison with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Splanchnic release of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi> was also augmented in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both arterial concentrations and splanchnic production of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17087">ketone</z:chebi> bodies were raised in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The proportion of splanchnic free fatty acid uptake which could be accounted for by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17087">ketone</z:chebi> body production was significantly greater in the patients (37 +/- 4%) than the controls (20 +/- 5%, p less than 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Estimated hepatic blood flow was 55% greater (p less than 0.01) in the patients as compared with the controls (1930 +/- 150 vs 1240 +/- 70 ml/min), while splanchnic oxygen uptake was similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>From these findings it is concluded that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> show (1) markedly increased hepatic blood flow, reflecting an inflammatory hyperaemia in the splanchnic region, (2) a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> net splanchnic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output, (3) accelerated hepatic gluconeogenesis as well as ketogenesis, probably as a consequence of the altered hormonal milieau, and (4) low concentrations of most amino acids possibly because of protein <z:hpo ids='HP_0002024'>malabsorption</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings underscore the importance of adequate protein and carbohydrate administration to this patient group </plain></SENT>
