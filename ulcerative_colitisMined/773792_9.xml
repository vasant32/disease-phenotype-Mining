<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean concentration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> was significantly greater than in the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, as well as in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, the lysozyme levels correlated with the severity of the disease process and with the extent of the lesions: the more severe the disease and the more extensive the involvement, the higher the lysozyme levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the lysozyme values of the different groups overlapped considerably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that lysozyme determinations have only limited discriminative value for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and for determining the severity and the extent of the disease process in the individual patient </plain></SENT>
