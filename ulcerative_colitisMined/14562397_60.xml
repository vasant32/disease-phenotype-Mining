<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine the prevalence of EIMs in a large IBD cohort in Veszprem Province in a 25-year follow-up study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight hundred and seventy-three IBD patients were enrolled (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>/UC/: 619, m/f: 317/302, mean age at presentation: 38.3 years, average disease duration: 11.2 years; <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>/CD/: 254, m/f: 125/129, mean age at presentation: 32.5 years, average disease duration: 9.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intestinal, extraintestinal signs and laboratory tests were monitored regularly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Any alteration suggesting an EIMs was investigated by a specialist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 21.3% of patients with IBD had EIM (UC: 15.0%, CD: 36.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age at presentation did not affect the likelihood of EIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of EIMs was higher in women and in CD, ocular complications and primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> (PSC) were more frequent in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In UC there was an increased tendency of EIM in patients with a more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849867" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">extensive disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Joint complications were more frequent in CD (22.4% vs UC 10.2%, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In UC positive family history increased the risk of joint complications (OR:3.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In CD the frequency of type-1 peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> was increased in patients with penetrating disease (P=0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>PSC was present in 1.6% in UC and 0.8% in CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Dermatological complications were present in 3.8% in UC and 10.2% in CD, the rate of ocular complications was around 3% in both diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Rare complications were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000099'>glomerulonephritis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune hemolytic anaemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Prevalence of EIM in Hungarian IBD patients is in concordance with data from Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The high number of EIM supports a role for complex follow-up in these patients </plain></SENT>
