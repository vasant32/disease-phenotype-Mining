<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The mechanisms behind microscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and exacerbations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> are incompletely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It seems highly likely that both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> antigens and bile are involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> increase colonic mucosal permeability by activating enteric neurones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The effect of 4 mM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28834">deoxycholic acid</z:chebi> (DCA) on the appearance rate of intravenously administered (3)H-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> and (14)C-<z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> into the lumen of the proximal and distal rat colon was measured in vivo and expressed as clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The nerve blocking agents <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> and hexamethonium were given intravenously, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> was applied onto the serosal surface of the colon, before and after DCA exposure RESULTS: DCA markedly increased clearance of the permeability probes into the lumen in both colonic segments and also the ratio of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> clearance, particularly in the distal colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi>, hexamethonium, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> significantly inhibited the increase in clearance by approximately 65-80% but did not affect the clearance ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the distal colon, the inhibitory effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, administration of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> and hexamethonium after DCA exposure significantly inhibited the DCA effect on clearance of the probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggest that in vivo, the permeability increase induced by a moderate concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> is to a large extent mediated by a neural mechanism involving muscarinic and nicotinic receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This mechanism may be a link between the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and colonic mucosal barrier function, and may be a new target for treatment </plain></SENT>
