<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TNF-alphaand sIL-2r were measured by ELISA method and IL-6 measured by biossay.RESULTS:TNF-alphaproduction stimulated by LPS and sIL-2r production by PHA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> were significantly lower than in healthy controls (TNF-alpha509(46-7244)ng/L vs 1995(117-18 950)ng/L, P &lt; 0.05; sIL-2r 320U/mlplus minus 165U/ml vs 451U/mlplus minus 247U/ml, P &lt; 0.05).Spontaneous TNF-alphaand sIL-2r production were not significantly different between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and controls (TNF-alpha304(46-7044)ng/L vs 215(46-4009)ng/L,P &gt; 0.05; sIL-2r 264U/mlplus minus 115U/ml vs 236U/mlplus minus139U/ml, P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IL-6 production by spontaneous release from PBMC in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> group was 109U/mlplus minus 94U/ml vs 44U/mlplus minus 39U/ml for those in healthy controls, P &lt; 0.01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IL-6 stimulated by LPS in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> group was (261U/ml plus minus 80U/ml) higher than in healthy controls (102U/mlplus minus 54U/ml, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No correlation of TNF-alpha, IL-6, sIL-2r production was found to disease activity, disease location and medication.CONCLUSION:Cytokine production from PBMC was also disturbed in Chinese patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
