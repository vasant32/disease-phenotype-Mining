<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients with suspected intra-abdominal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> were investigated prospectively with ultrasound and with 99mTc-hexamethylpropylene-<z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> (HMPAO) isotope labelled mixed leucocytes, using 111-In tropolonate granulocyte scanning as the reference standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty five patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (three were postoperative): 21 of these had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and four had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The remainder comprised nine with postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and 16 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> was diagnosed when focal activity on serial 111-In tropolonate and 99m-Tc-HMPOA images at one, three, and 24 hours resulted in activity at least equal to liver activity at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirteen abscesses were diagnosed using each type of white cell scanning, resulting in 100% sensitivity for 99m-Tc-HMPAO compared with 111-In tropolonate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bowel <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was easily distinguished from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> on serial images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight of these 13 abscesses were detected by ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Altogether 17 abscesses were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound detected 12, including four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023885" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver abscesses</z:e> which were not purulent and had not been detected by white cell scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound had a sensitivity of 71% (12 of 17) and a specificity of 87% (33 of 38) using <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> confirmed abscesses as the reference standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>White cell scanning showed a sensitivity of 76% (13 of 17: as a result of the four non-purulent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023885" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver abscesses</z:e>) and a specificity of 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>99m-Tc-HMPAO scanning is as accurate as 111-In tropolonate scanning, and has several advantages including simplicity, availability, superior image quality, and reduced radiation dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Both methods are more sensitive and specific than ultrasound for intra-abdominal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> detection but ultrasound is advisable if a neutrophil infiltrate is not suspected </plain></SENT>
