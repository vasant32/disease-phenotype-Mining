<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined disease specific determinants of different aspects of low sexual function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Women with IBD aged 18 to 65 presenting to the university departments of internal medicine and surgery were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, a random sample from the national patients organization was used (separate analyses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sexual function was assessed by the Brief Index of Sexual Function in Women, comprising seven different domains of sexuality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Function was considered impaired if subscores were &lt;-1 on a z-normalized scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results are presented as age adjusted odds ratios with 95% CI based on multiple logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 336 questionnaires were included (219 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 117 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most women reported low sexual activity (63%; 17% none at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 20% moderate or high activity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Partnership satisfaction was high in spite of low sexual interest in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Depressed mood was the strongest predictor of low sexual function scores in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Urban residency and higher socioecomic status had a protective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was moderately associated with low desire (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Severity of the disease course impacted most on intercourse frequency (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.4 to 4.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Lubrication problems were more common in smokers (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.3 to 5.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Mood disturbances and social environment impacted more on sexual function in women with IBD than disease specific factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Smoking is associated with lubrication problems </plain></SENT>
