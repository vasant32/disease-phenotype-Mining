<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The subclass distribution of IgA producing cells was determined by paired immunofluorescence staining in colonic specimens from 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and eight with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosa, the percentage of IgA1 immunocytes showed a striking increase in both disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The proportion of mucosal IgA1 cells was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (median, 71.2%) than in Crohn <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (median, 56.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within each category of specimens no significant differences were noted between <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> and basal mucosal zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The submucosal proportion of IgA1 cells was, however, significantly higher than the mucosal one in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (median, 89.1%; p less than 0.002) and Crohn <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (median, 91.8%; p less than 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mucosal shift towards IgA1 production paralleled the magnitude of the submucosal IgA1 cell proportion in individual tissue samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together with the previously reported dramatic increase of local IgG production (particularly observed in the submucosa and basal parts of the mucosa), our findings indicated that there is an influx and/or proliferation of B cells representing systemic secondary immunity in the lesions of both diseases </plain></SENT>
