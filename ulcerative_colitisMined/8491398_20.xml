<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Metabolites of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> have been implicated in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>-they can stimulate intestinal secretion, increase mucosal blood flow, and influence smooth muscle activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The influence on the mucosal transport function of culture medium in which colonic mucosal biopsy specimens had been incubated was investigated using rat stripped distal colonic mucosa in vitro as the assay system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Colonic tissue from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and from control subjects was cultured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medium from inflamed tissue contained more <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28666">leukotriene D4</z:chebi> (LTD4) and evoked a greater electrical (secretory) response in rat colonic mucosa than control tissue medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In inflamed tissue, cyclo-oxygenase inhibition (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi>) attenuated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> but increased LTD4 production; conversely lipoxygenase inhibition (ICI 207968) inhibited LTD4 production but enhanced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each inhibitor alone enhanced the electrical response in the rat colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of both enzymes (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> plus ICI 207968) caused a fall in both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> (82%) and LTD4 (89%) production and in the electrical response (57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inflamed tissue treated with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50469">phospholipase A2 inhibitor</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8711">mepacrine</z:chebi>) produced less <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi>, LTD4, and electrical responses when compared with inflamed tissue, either untreated (91%, 92%, and 79% respectively) or treated with cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Incubation with bradykinin stimulated eicosanoid release and electrical response, while a bradykinin <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> caused a modest inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of these observations suggests that a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> derivatives accounts for about half the secretory response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other products of phospholipase A2 activity are probably responsible for much of the remainder, leaving up to 20% the result of types of mediator not determined in this study </plain></SENT>
