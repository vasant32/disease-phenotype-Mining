<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the natural history of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in a series of 28 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients in whom the search for HCMV was positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A series of 85 patients with moderate-severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> flare-up were evaluated for a HCMV search by performing a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin stain, immunohistochemical assay and nested polymerase chain reaction on rectal biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 85 screened patients (19 of whom were steroid resistant/dependent), 28 were positive for HCMV; after remission the patients were followed up clinically and histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 22 patients with complete follow-up, in 8 (36%) patients HCMV-DNA persisted in the intestinal specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the HCMV positive patients, 4 (50%) experienced at least one moderate-severe flare-up of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> without evidence of peripheral HCMV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 14 HCMV negative patients, 3 with pouches developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> and 5 out of 11 (45%) experienced a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> flare-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results suggest that HCMV may remain in the colon after an <z:hpo ids='HP_0100282'>acute colitis</z:hpo> flare-up despite remission; it seems that the virus is not responsible for the disease relapse </plain></SENT>
