<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD), which includes <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), is three or more times higher in northern than in southern Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this EC funded study was to investigate this apparent variation by ascertaining the incidence of IBD across Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: For the period 1 October 1991 to 30 September 1993 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> new patients diagnosed with IBD were prospectively identified in 20 European centres according to a standard protocol for case ascertainment and definition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Altogether 2201 patients aged 15 years or more were identified, of whom 1379 were diagnosed as UC (including <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp>), 706 as CD, and 116 as indeterminate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence per 100,000 at ages 15-64 years (standardised for age and sex) of UC was 10.4 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 7.6 to 13.1) and that of CD was 5.6 (95% CI 2.8 to 8.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rates of UC in northern centres were 40% higher than those in the south (rate ratio (RR) = 1.4 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.5)) and for CD they were 80% higher (RR = 1.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For UC the highest reported incidence was in Iceland (24.5, 95% CI 17.4 to 31.5) and for CD, Maastricht (The Netherlands; 9.2, 95% CI 6.5 to 11.8) and Amiens (north west France; 9.2, 95% CI 6.3 to 12.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lowest incidence of UC was in Almada (southern Portugal) (1.6, 95% CI 0.0 to 3.2) and of CD in Ioannina (north west Greece) (0.9, 95% CI 0.0 to 2.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An unexpected finding was a difference in the age specific incidence of UC in men and women with the incidence in women but not men declining with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: The higher overall incidence rates in northern centres did not seem to be explained by differences in tobacco consumption or education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the magnitude of the observed excess for both conditions is less than expected on the basis of previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This may reflect recent increases in the incidence of IBD in southern Europe whereas those in the north may have stabilised </plain></SENT>
