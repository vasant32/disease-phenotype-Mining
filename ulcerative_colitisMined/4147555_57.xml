<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The acetylator phenotype was determined on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean serum concentration (mug/ml) (at steady state eight +/- two days in patients responding to treatment) of SASP, total SP, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> were 18.7 +/- 12.8; 53.7 +/- 23.1; and 1 +/- 0.9 for slow acetylators and 17.6 +/- 7.1; 31 +/- 9.0 and 1 +/- 0.9 for fast acetylators respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hour urinary excretion of SASP, total SP, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> were 4.6% +/- 3.1; 52% +/- 9.6 and 22.3 +/- 6.7% of the administered dose respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum total SP concentration of 20 to 50 mug/ml appeared to coincide with clinical improvement in the absence of any side effects related to salicylazosulphapyridine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No such relationship could be shown with serum SASP, individual metabolites, or 5-aminosalicyclic acid </plain></SENT>
