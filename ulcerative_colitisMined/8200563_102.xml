<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mucosal specimens from active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (ileum, n = 6; colon, n = 6), active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (n = 9), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ileum (n = 6), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon (n = 6) were subjected to paired immunofluorescence staining for characterisation of macrophage subsets in situ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> state, only few CD68+ macrophages (&lt; 10%) expressing the myelomonocytic L1 antigen (calprotectin) were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In inflamed mucosa, especially near small vessels, the CD68+L1+ fraction increased with the degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> to median 65% (range 35-91%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cells reactive with the monoclonal antibody RFD7 were also increased in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> but less than 5% of them costained for L1 antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that L1 producing macrophages are distinct from the RFD7+ subset and probably recently recruited from peripheral blood monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Like granulocytes, L1+ macrophages may be important in non-specific defence, providing calprotectin with putative anti-microbial and anti-proliferative properties </plain></SENT>
