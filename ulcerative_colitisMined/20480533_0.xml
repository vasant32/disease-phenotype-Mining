<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e>) is a serious and fatal pulmonary manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have experienced a 67-year-old male patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> associated with a severe type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> symptoms occurred during the treatment of UC in a previous hospital and the patient was transferred to our hospital on June 27, 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both blood and sputa cultures for bacteria and fungi were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytomegalovirus antigenemia was also not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From the clinical and radiological [Chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT)] findings, the patient was diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> on the basis of the definition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> developed by the European-American Consensus Conference on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammations</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> symptoms of the patient were resistant to any medical treatment including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> symptoms were dramatically improved after surgical colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We believe that severe colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> from UC was closely associated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our case report suggests that a severe type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> might be taken into consideration as one of the predisposing factors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
