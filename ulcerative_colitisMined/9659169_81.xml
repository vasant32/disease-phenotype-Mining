<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Colonoscopic surveillance is a standard procedure in many patients with long standing, extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), in order to avoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No conclusive proof of its benefits has been presented however </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To evaluate the association between colonoscopic surveillance and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mortality in patients with UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A population based, nested case control study comprising 142 patients with a definite UC diagnosis, derived from a study population of 4664 patients with UC, was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Colonoscopic surveillance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with UC who had died from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> after 1975 was compared with that in controls matched for age, sex, extent, and duration of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Information on colonoscopic surveillance was obtained from the medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two of 40 patients with UC and 18 of 102 controls had undergone at least one surveillance colonoscopy (relative risk (RR) 0.29, 95% confidence interval 0.06 to 1.31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve controls but only one patient with UC had undergone two or more surveillance colonoscopies (RR 0.22, 95% confidence interval 0.03 to 1.74), indicating a protective dose response relation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Colonoscopic surveillance may be associated with a decreased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in patients with long standing UC </plain></SENT>
