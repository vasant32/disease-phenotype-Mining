<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients had coexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, including three who had previously undergone colectomy and one who discontinued treatment after three months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 26 patients, 16 received cyclosporin and 10 received placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy was performed at entry to confirm the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> disease activity was prospectively classified annually as remission/mild, moderate, or severe using the Truelove and Witt's criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Before treatment there were no differences between the cyclosporin and placebo groups in the number of patients with remission/mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, 14/16 (88%) v 9/10 (90%), and moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, 2/16 (12%) v 1/10 (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During treatment, a remission/mild disease course was present in 15/16 (94%) v 6/10 (60%), p = 0.05 and a moderate disease course in 1/16 (6%) v 4/10 (40%), p = 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that patients treated with cyclosporin for primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> who have coexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> have a more benign course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> resulting both from improvement of moderately active <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and from fewer flares of remission/mildly active <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that cyclosporin may be of benefit to the colon in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> who are being treated with cyclosporin for primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
