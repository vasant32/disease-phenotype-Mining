<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen steroid-naive patients with moderately active UC received one LCAP session every week for five consecutive weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The remission rate 8 weeks after the last LCAP session was 61.1% (11/18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients with deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> showed worsening after LCAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the remaining 15 patients, who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> or geographic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, the average clinical activity index (CAI) score dropped significantly from 9.4 to 3.8 eight weeks after the last LCAP session (t = 4.89, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average C-reactive protein (CRP) levels before and after LCAP were 1.2 mg/dL and 1.0 mg/dL, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath>, geographic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, and deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, 100% (9/9), 33.3% (2/6), and 0% (0/3) were in remission 8 weeks after the last LCAP session, respectively (chi(2) = 7.65, P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight weeks after the last LCAP session, the remission rates for patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> and geographic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were 44.4% (4/9) and 16.7% (1/6), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only one patient suffered a mild adverse event after LCAP (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: LCAP is a useful and safe therapy for steroid-naive UC patients with moderate disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the efficacy of the treatment can be predicted on the basis of endoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
