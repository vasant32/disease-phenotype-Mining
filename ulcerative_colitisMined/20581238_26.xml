<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD), comprising Crohn s disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, is characterised by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> relapsing <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of the gut </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased proteasome activity, associated with the expression of immunoproteasomes, was found to enhance proinflammatory signalling and thus promotes <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to explore whether modulation of the proteasomal activity is a suitable therapeutic approach to limit <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This concept was assessed in two different experimental set-ups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Development of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32149">sodium sulfate</z:chebi> (DSS)-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> was tested (1) in lmp7(-/-) mice lacking the immunoproteasome subunit LMP7 and (2) in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) mice treated with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with WT mice, lmp7(-/-) mice develop significantly attenuated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> due to reduced nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signalling in the absence of LMP7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> revealed dose-dependent amelioration of DSS-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both approaches modulation of the proteasome activity limited the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consequently, infiltration of the colon by neutrophils and expansion of inflammatory T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 T cells was diminished and thus prevented excessive tissue damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It was demonstrated that modulation of the proteasome activity is effective in attenuating experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results reveal that reduction of the proteasome activity either by partial inhibition with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> or by specifically targeting the immunoproteasome subunit LMP7 is a suitable treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
