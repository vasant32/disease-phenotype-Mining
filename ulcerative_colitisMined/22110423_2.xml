<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite a review of his clinical history and various tests, the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> could not be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> was considered possible, administration of the time-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> preparation and AZA was discontinued, and conservative treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001735'>acute pancreatitis</z:hpo> was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> promptly improved with these treatments, but drug lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST) for both the time-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> formulation and AZA was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A pH-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> formulation was given for maintenance therapy of UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> relapsed, drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> was strongly suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> was discontinued, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> was smoothly in remission by conservative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to the positive DLST result for the pH-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> formulation and the clinical course, a diagnosis of pH-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> due to this formulation was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the clinical course of UC, occurrence of drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> must always be considered </plain></SENT>
