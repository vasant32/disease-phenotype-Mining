<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty seven patients with mild to moderate UC were randomized to receive a four-wk course of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalamine</z:chebi> (2.4 g/d) plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">N-acetyl-L-cysteine</z:chebi> (0.8 g/d) (group A) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalamine</z:chebi> plus placebo (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were monitored using the Modified Truelove-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271977" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Witts</z:e> Severity Index (MTWSI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was clinical remission (MTWSI &lt; or = 2) at 4 wk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints were clinical response (defined as a reduction from baseline in the MTWSI of &gt; or = 2 points) and drug safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The serum TNF-alpha, interleukin-6, interleukin-8 and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 were evaluated at baseline and at 4 wk of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analysis per-protocol criteria showed clinical remission rates of 63% and 50% after 4 wk treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalamine</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">N-acetyl-L-cysteine</z:chebi> (group A) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalamine</z:chebi> plus placebo (group B) respectively (OR = 1.71; 95% CI: 0.46 to 6.36; P = 0.19; NNT = 7.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of data indicated a significant reduction of MTWSI in group A (P = 0.046) with respect to basal condition without significant changes in the group B (P = 0.735) during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical responses were 66% (group A) vs 44% (group B) after 4 wk of treatment (OR = 2.5; 95% CI: 0.64 to 9.65; P = 0.11; NNT = 4.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical improvement in group A correlated with a decrease of IL-8 and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rates of adverse events did not differ significantly between both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In group A (oral NAC combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalamine</z:chebi>) contrarily to group B (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalamine</z:chebi> alone), the clinical improvement correlates with a decrease of chemokines such as <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and IL-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>NAC addition not produced any side effects </plain></SENT>
