<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gastrointestinal tract has developed ingenious mechanisms to coexist with its autologous microflora, but rapidly responds to invading pathogens and then returns to homeostasis with its commensal bacteria after the pathogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> is cleared </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previous studies showed that some commensal bacteria are detrimental while others have either no influence or have a protective action </plain></SENT>
