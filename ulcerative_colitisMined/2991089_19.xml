<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Faecal activities of potential mucus-degrading glycosidases have therefore been assayed in samples from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The enzymes alpha-D-galactosidase, beta-D-galactosidase, beta-NAc-D-glucosaminidase alpha-L-fucosidase and neuraminidase were assayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Considerable glycosidase activity was present in most faecal samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar activities of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the enzymes assayed were found in faeces from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and there was no significant correlation with disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results imply that relapse of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> is not initiated by increased degradation of colonic mucus by faecal glycosidases but do not exclude a role for <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> mucus degradation in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
