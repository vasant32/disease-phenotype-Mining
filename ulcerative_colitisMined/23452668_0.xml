<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) are treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> (PSL), which causes adverse side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Extracorporeal granulocyte/monocyte adsorption (GMA) with an Adacolumn depletes elevated/activated myeloid lineage leucocytes as sources of inflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We were interested to evaluate the efficacy, safety and the treatment cost for PSL and GMA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-one patients with active UC had achieved remission with GMA, at 1 or 2 sessions/week, up to 10 sessions (n=24) or with orally administered PSL (1mg/kg bodyweight, n=17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical activity index (CAI) ≤4 was considered clinical remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following remission, patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi> (2250-3000mg/day) or sulphasalazine (4000-6000mg/day) as maintenance therapy and were followed for 600 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total treatment cost was assessed based on 1€=150JPY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PSL was tapered after two weeks, and discontinued when a patient achieved remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average time to the disappearance of at least one major UC symptom (haematochezia, diarrhoea, or abdominal discomfort) was 15.3 days in the GMA group and 12.7 days in the PSL group, while time to remission was 27.9 days in the GMA group and 27.6 days in the PSL group, CAI 0.8 and 2.0, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier plots showed similar remission maintenance rates over the 600 days follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The average medical cost was 12739.4€/patient in the GMA group and 8751.3€ in the PSL group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the GMA group, 5 transient adverse events were observed vs 10 steroid related adverse events in the PSL group (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In appropriately selected patients, GMA has significant efficacy with no safety concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The higher cost of GMA vs PSL should be compromised by good safety profile of this non-pharmacological treatment intervention </plain></SENT>
