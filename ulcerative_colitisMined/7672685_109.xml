<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty seven patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, 78 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (52 of them (66.7%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ileal disease</z:e>), and seven had indeterminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone mineral density values (g/cm2) measured by dual energy x ray absorbtiometry at the spine (L2-L4), the femoral neck, Ward's triangle, and the trochanter were 1.177, 0.948, 0.850, and 0.838 in the patients and 1.228 (p = 0.034), 1.001 (p = 0.009), 0.889 (NS), and 0.888 (p = 0.012) in the control group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The type or extent of the disease or previous small bowel resection did not have any significant effect on the bone mineral density values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a weak, but statistically significant negative correlation between bone mineral density and the total lifetime <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> dose (in the lumbar spine r = -0.164, p = 0.04, the femoral neck r = -0.185, p = 0.02, Ward's triangle r = -0.167, p = 0.04, and the trochanter r = -0.237, p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients whose lifetime <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> dose (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>) was more than 10 g had especially low bone mineral density (p &lt; 0.05 compared with the groups with no or less than 5 g of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients who had never taken peroral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> did not have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000938'>decreased bone mineral density</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, IBD patients have significantly lower bone mineral density values than healthy controls, but the difference is not so great as has been reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low bone mineral density values in these patients are related to high lifetime <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> doses </plain></SENT>
