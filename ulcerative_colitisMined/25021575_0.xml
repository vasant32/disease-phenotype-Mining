<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Numerous studies have recorded short term clinical remission rates while few have examined the long term end-points of colectomy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and steroid free remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Queen's Hospital, Romford is one of the largest centres performing leucoytapheresis in the UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we present a retrospective case series of patients treated with the AdacolumnÂ® leucocytapheresis filter column for UC between 2008 and 2012, designed to assess these long term end-points with follow-up to June 2013 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Case notes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent leucocytapheresis for refractory UC were reviewed retrospectively to assess the primary end-points of colectomy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and the secondary end-points of clinical remission and steroid-free remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 34 patients met the entry criteria and relevant outcome data was available in 31/34 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prior to leucocytapheresis 94% of patients were steroid dependent and 91% had previously failed treatment with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean number of leucocytapheresis columns given was 7.7 +/- 0.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following treatment 23% underwent colectomy a median 7 months after the start of this treatment with a mean overall follow-up of 500 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>1 patient died during the study period (from a sub-arachnoid haemorrhage) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>52% experienced an initial clinical response and 32% remained in steroid-free remission at 1 year after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The rate of colectomy after leucocytapheresis compares favourably with other rescue therapies(.1,2) The rate of steroid-free remission with leucocytapheresis is comparable to the response rates seen in randomised controlled trials of anti-TNF therapy(.3)Given that the patients in this study were steroid dependent and had been refractory or intolerant to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi>, these results are similar to sub-group analysis of an earlier sham-controlled trial in which those patients with severe UC were more likely to respond to leucocytapheresis than sham(.4) Leucocytapheresis appears to be a safe and useful option for patients with refractory UC </plain></SENT>
