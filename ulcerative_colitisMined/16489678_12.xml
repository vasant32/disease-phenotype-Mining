<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort of 229 unrelated patients with UC recruited from a single centre and 261 healthy volunteers were analysed for the presence of Thr105Ile and His645Asp amino acid substitutions at <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> N-methyltransferase (HNMT) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15571,23666">diamine</z:chebi> oxidase (ABP1) enzymes, respectively, by amplification-restriction procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were phenotyped and followed up for at least 2 years (mean time 11 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the distribution of ABP1 alleles between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients and healthy individuals [OR (95% CI) for variant alleles=1.22 (0.91-1.61)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, mutated ABP1 alleles were present with higher frequency among the 58 patients that required immunosuppressive drugs [OR (95 % CI) for carriers of mutated alleles 2.41 (1.21-4.83; P=0.006)], with a significant gene-dose effect (P=0.0038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In agreement with the predominant role of ABP1 versus HNMT on local <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> metabolism in human bowel, the frequencies for carriers of HNMT genotypes or mutated alleles were similar among patients, regardless clinical evolution, and control individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The His645Asp polymorphism of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> metabolising enzyme ABP1 is related to severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
