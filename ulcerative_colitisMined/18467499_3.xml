<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>T cell anergy, one of the main mechanisms of tolerance, has been shown to be induced by E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as gene related to anergy in lymphocytes (GRAIL), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Itch</z:e>, and c-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is not well known whether these E3 ligases play roles in human diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiological role of the E3 ligases in patients with UC was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At first, the expression of GRAIL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Itch</z:e>, and c-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi> in human anergic T cells was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR and Western immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Next, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of the E3 ligases was analyzed in peripheral CD4+ T cells of 20 patients with UC and 10 healthy volunteers (HV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was analyzed in patients with active UC before and after treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> and leukocytapheresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anergic human CD4+ T cells expressed significantly higher levels of GRAIL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Itch</z:e>, and c-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi> than nonanergic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GRAIL expression was significantly higher in patients with UC in remission than in patients with active disease and in HV (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The level of GRAIL expression was also significantly increased in patients with active disease whose clinical activity index scores improved after treatment (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Itch</z:e> and c-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi> expression among patients with active UC, patients with UC in remission, and HV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that GRAIL plays an important role in maintaining remission in patients with UC </plain></SENT>
