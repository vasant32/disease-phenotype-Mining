<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in less debilitating disorders, such as IBD, limited data are available about the impact of the disease on caregiver's well-being </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to identify the emotional and physical distress among family caregivers of IBD patients in order to provide preventive services to an at-risk but hidden population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Over a 19 month period, in the tertiary referral centre for IBD in Central Greece, we interviewed 44 family caregivers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's Disease</z:hpo> (CD) and 41 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative Colitis</z:hpo> (UC) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Caregiver's distress was assessed by using the caregiver self-assessment questionnaire "How Are You ?" of the American Medical Association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was assessed using the Harvey-Bradshaw index for CD and Simple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>Colitis</z:hpo> Activity Index for UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A card with the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the population were also collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The impact of each characteristic on caregiver's well-being was studied with one and two way ANOVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 84,7% of the caregivers showed high levels of emotional and physical distress with the majority of them to be middle-aged women (61.2%) with basic educational level (61,2%)and full-time employment (65,9%) at the time of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant difference found on the level of distress between caregivers of CD and those of UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Factor analysis identified that female gender, active disease, disease related complications and long lasting disease had significant impact on the caregiver's level of distress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Family caregivers of IBD patients experience high levels of emotional and physical distress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Active disease, disease related complications, long lasting disease and female gender have significant impact on caregiver's level of distress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is necessary to organise a network to provide psychosocial services for the caregivers of IBD patients </plain></SENT>
