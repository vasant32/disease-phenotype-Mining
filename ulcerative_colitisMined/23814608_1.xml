<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients respond to treatment and some lose response or become intolerant over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunogenicity, a well established phenomenon with anti-TNF agents, may have important clinical implications in patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive review of available evidence demonstrating how drug concentrations, immunogenicity, and other factors influence outcomes with anti-TNF agents was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PubMed, EMBASE, Biosis, Dialog, and Conference Papers Index were searched from 1 January 1995 to 7 April 2012 to identify clinical trials in adult and pediatric patients with IBD treated with anti-TNF agents for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data on serum drug levels and immunogenicity and their relationship with clinical efficacy and safety outcomes were extracted and examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum infliximab concentrations correlated with clinical efficacy and treatment outcomes in patients with IBD; this relationship is less well characterized with adalimumab and certolizumab pegol concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multiple studies, the presence and level of antibodies to infliximab correlated with loss of clinical efficacy and increased risk of infusion reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence and clinical impact of antibody formation with adalimumab or certolizumab in IBD is becoming evident as more data become available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Current, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based anti-TNF antibody assays are suboptimal in that results are often inconclusive and comparisons between agents cannot be made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Measurement of anti-TNF agent drug concentrations and assessment of immunogenicity has the potential to positively impact clinical decision making during anti-TNF therapy for IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As assays are optimized, it is expected that the clinical impact of these determinations will be better characterized </plain></SENT>
