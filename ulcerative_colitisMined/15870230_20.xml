<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Surveillance colonoscopy is widely recommended in patients with longstanding and extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) in order to detect colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> at an early stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it still remains questionable whether surveillance colonoscopy effectively enables early detection of UC associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is a great need for sensitive markers to identify individuals at increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> receptor (OR) gene shows age related methylation in the colorectal epithelium and is methylated frequently in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, suggesting that OR methylation may predispose to colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AIM: To clarify whether analysis of methylation of the OR gene in non-neoplastic epithelium can contribute to prediction of increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> risk in UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Materials and METHODS: A total of 165 non-neoplastic colorectal epithelia from 30 patients with longstanding and extensive UC, including 13 UC patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and 17 patients without, were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Methylation specific polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine the methylation status of the OR gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Methylation of the OR gene was detected in 54 of 70 (77.1%) non-neoplastic colorectal epithelia in UC with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> but in only 23 of 95 (24.2%) without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Methylation of the OR gene was significantly more frequent in non-neoplastic epithelium from UC with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> colitic epithelium from UC without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in UC with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, the OR gene was extensively methylated in non-neoplastic epithelia throughout the colorectum compared with those in UC without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that analysis of OR gene methylation may have potential as a useful marker for identifying individuals at increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> among those with longstanding and extensive UC </plain></SENT>
