<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There is a clear need for a rapid, simple, safe, and sensitive method of determining the type and intensity of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the gut mucosa in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have evaluated the potential of a new method, the mucosal patch technique, in patients with and without apparent gut <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, as assessed by conventional diagnostic procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects and METHODS: The technique tested is based on the idea that <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> released from the rectal mucosa can be absorbed by and then extracted from cellulose patches brought into contact with the mucosa by use of an instrument with an inflatable balloon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measurements were performed in healthy controls (n = 16) and in patients with active (n = 19) and inactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC, n = 8), collagen <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (CC, n = 12), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coeliac disease</z:e> (n = 13), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022104" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IBS">irritable bowel syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>, n = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>Inflammatory mediators</z:mp> from neutrophils (myeloperoxidase (MPO)) and eosinophils (eosinophil cationic protein (ECP)) were increased on average 300- and 10-fold, respectively, in patients with active UC compared with healthy controls and were correlated with the endoscopic score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with inactive UC, CC, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coeliac disease</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> exhibited no endoscopic signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These patient groups had significantly lower levels of MPO and ECP than the active UC group but showed on average a four- to sevenfold increase in MPO compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The mucosal patch technique was well tolerated by patients and easily applied by the investigator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pronounced neutrophil and eosinophil involvement in UC was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With the high sensitivity of the technique, low degree mucosal neutrophil activation could also be quantified in patients with CC and UC in clinical remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The finding of increased neutrophil involvement in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> contributes to the pathophysiological ideas of this disease </plain></SENT>
