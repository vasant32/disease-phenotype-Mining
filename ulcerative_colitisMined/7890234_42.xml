<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The serum sIL-6R concentrations in patients with active disease (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, 148.4 (5.1); <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 142.3 (9.3) ng/ml; mean (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>)) were significantly raised compared with those in patients with inactive disease (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, 116.2 (7.2); <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 114.3 (7.1) ng/ml), some other type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (104.8 (11.6) ng/ml), or in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (107.3 (2.4) ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These differences were also seen in paired samples examined during both active and inactive phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, serum sIL-6R and IL-6 concentrations correlated significantly with C-reactive protein levels in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients (r = 0.23 and 0.56, respectively; p &lt; 0.05 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, gel filtration analysis of serum from these patients showed two major peaks of immunoreactive IL-6-one peak corresponding to free IL-6 and another peak to sIL-6R-bound IL-6-this was further confirmed by a luminescence sandwich ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results, together with its in vitro effects, indicate that natural sIL-6R may function as a powerful enhancer of the IL-6-dependent immune processes observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
