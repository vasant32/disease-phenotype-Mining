<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The intestinal expression pattern and general tissue distribution of the M(r) 40 kD putative epithelial autoantigen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> were re-examined by in situ two and three colour immunofluorescence staining including the murine monoclonal antibody 7E12H12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The intestinal distribution was also compared with the epithelial codeposition of IgG1 and activated complement (C3b and terminal complement complex) seen selectively in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The M(r) 40 kD antigen was found for the first time in goblet cells of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> terminal ileum and proximal colon but not in rectal goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By contrast, colonic enterocytes expressed this antigen apically with increasing intensity in a distal direction, expanding to intense cytoplasmic expression in rectal enterocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The antigen was also expressed by the epithelium of the fallopian tubes, major bile ducts, gall bladder, and epidermis but not by proximal gastrointestinal tract epithelium or 13 other extra-gastrointestinal organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Activated complement and IgG1 often colocalised with the M, 40 kD antigen apically on the surface epithelium in active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> but not in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results support the idea that an <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune response</z:mp> to this antigen, leading to complement activation mediated by IgG1, is a possible pathogenetic mechanism for epithelial damage and persistent <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
