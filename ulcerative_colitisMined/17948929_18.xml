<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epidemiologic data support genetic contribution to the pathogenesis of IBD, which include familial aggregation, twin studies, racial and ethnic differences in disease prevalence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Linkage studies have identified several susceptibility genes contained in different genomic regions named <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBD1</z:e> to IBD9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD2) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes are the most extensively studied genetic regions (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBD1</z:e> and IBD3 respectively) in IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations of the NOD2 gene are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and several HLA genes are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Toll like receptors (TLRs) have an important role in the innate immune response against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> by mediating recognition of pathogen-associated microbial patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Studying single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in molecules involved in <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> recognition seems to be essential to define genetic backgrounds at risk of IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recently, numerous new genes have been identified to be involved in the genetic susceptibility to IBD: NOD1/Caspase-activation recruitment domains 4 (CARD4), Chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20), IL-11, and IL-18 among others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The characterization of these novel genes potentially will lead to the identification of therapeutic agents and clinical assessment of phenotype and prognosis in patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
