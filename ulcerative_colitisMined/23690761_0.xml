<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The knowledge about correlation patterns between the fecal microbiota and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> (IBD)-comprising the two subforms <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC)-for newly diagnosed untreated children is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To address this knowledge gap, a selection of faecal specimens (CD, n = 27 and UC, n = 16) and non-IBD controls (n = 30) children (age &lt; 18 years) was analysed utilising <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> small subunit (SSU) rRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found, surprising age dependence for the fecal microbiota correlating to IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most pronounced patterns were that E. coli was positively (R (2) = 0.16, P = 0.05) and Bacteroidetes, negatively (R (2) = 0.15, P = 0.05) correlated to age for CD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For UC, we found an apparent opposite age-related disease correlation for both Bacteroides and Escherichia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was an overrepresentation of Haemophilus for the UC children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From our, results we propose a model where the aetiology of IBD is related to an on-going immunological development in children requiring different age-dependent <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The impact of our findings could be a better age stratification for understanding and treating IBD in children </plain></SENT>
