<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To explore the association of magnifying endoscopic (ME) findings with histopathology and relapse in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-six patients with UC underwent ME with narrow band imaging (NBI) and crystal violet staining and were followed for more than 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ME findings with vital staining were classified into ME-A, regular arrangement of round to oval pits; ME-B, irregular arrangement with/without enlarged spaces between even pits; ME-C, irregular pits in size and shape with more irregular arrangement of pits; and ME-D, disrupted or disappeared pits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NBI-guided ME features of microvascular pattern (MVP) were divided into the MVP-regular and MVP-irregular type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 5, 24, 10, and 7 cases of ME-A, ME-B, ME-C, and ME-D grade, respectively, while there were 21 and 25 of MVP-regular and MVP-irregular type, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ME classifications were significantly associated with Matts endoscopic grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ME classifications and MVP types were significantly associated with each pathognomonic microscopic feature of severe mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, crypt <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>, and goblet cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences in the percentages of remission among ME classifications and between MVP types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ME findings can be predictive of relapse in UC and reliable for in vivo histopathological assessment </plain></SENT>
