<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of both enzymes was focally lost in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and markedly reduced in advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, the disease progression correlating with the decreased expression of MST and TST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In HT-29 cells, a human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell line, TST activity and expression were significantly increased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> and by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibition, agents that promote HT-29 cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
