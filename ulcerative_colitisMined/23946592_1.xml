<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed an observational descriptive study comparing the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> in IBD patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi> and patients not treated with these drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We included 812 patients which were divided in two groups depending on whether they have received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi> or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have studied basal characteristics of both groups (age when the disease was diagnosed, sex, type of IBD, etc.) and treatments received (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">Azathioprine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50667">mercaptopurine</z:chebi>, infliximab, adalimumab or other immunomodulators), as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis was performed with the student t test, χ(2) test or Wilcoxon exact test as appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A logistic regression analysis was performed as multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical significance was establish at P values of less than 0.05, and 95%CI were used for the odds ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 812 patients included, 429 (52.83%) have received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi>: 79.5% <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>, 14% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50667">mercaptopurine</z:chebi> and 6.5% both drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>44.76% of patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi> and 46, 48% of patients who did not receive this treatment were women (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi> was 30.3% compare to 66 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>67% of patients not treated (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> dose was 123.79 ± 36.5 mg/d (range: 50-250 mg/d), mean usage time was 72.16 ± 55.7 mo (range: 1-300 mo) and the accumulated dose along this time was 274.32 ± 233.5 g (1.5-1350 g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>With respect to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50667">mercaptopurine</z:chebi>, mean dose was 74.7 ± 23.9 mg/d (range: 25-150 mg/d), mean usage time of 23.37 ± 27.6 mo (range: 1-118 mo), and the accumulated dose along this time was 52.2 ± 63.5 g (range: 1.5-243 g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">Thiopurine</z:chebi> S-methyltransferase activity was tested in 66% of patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi>, among which 98.2% had an intermediate or high activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Among the patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi>, 27.27% (112 patients) and 11.66% (50 patients) received treatment with Infliximab and Adalimumab respectively, but only 1.83% (7 patients) and 0.78% (3 patients) received these drugs in the group of patients who did not received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.001 and P &lt; 0.001 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Finally, 6.8% (29 patients) among those treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi> have received other <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">Methotrexate</z:chebi>, Tacrolimus, Cyclosporin), compare to 1% (4 patients) of patients not treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Among patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi>, 3.97% developed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, and among those not treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> presented in 8.1% (P = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The most frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> were colorectal ones (12 cases in patients not treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi> but none in treated, P &lt; 0.001) followed by non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007114" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">skin cancer</z:e> (8 patients in treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi> and 6 in not treated, P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our experience, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> therapy did not increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> development in IBD patients, and was an effective and safe treatment for these diseases </plain></SENT>
