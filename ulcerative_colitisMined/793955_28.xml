<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Control specimens were obtained from 16 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and 12 subjects without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Characteristic transmural inflammatory infiltrates in CD consisted mainly of lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A wide variation of the relative T-cell proportion was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in contrast with UC, abundant numbers of T-lymphocytes in CD were often detected, particularly in the deeper layers of the bowel wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in serial sections immunoglobulin-containing plasma cells were counted, using specific anti-IgA, -IgM, and -IgG antisera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant reduction of the IgA/IgM plasma cell-ratio was found in CD in comparison with UC and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that in CD a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cellular immune reaction is going on within the diseases gut, involving increased numbers of lymphocytes and particularly T-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It remains to be established whether a deficient IgA barrier has to be considered of primary pathogenetic importance </plain></SENT>
