<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A population-based cohort study of 4278 UC patients hospitalised between 2002 and 2008 was conducted in Ontario, Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: UC patients admitted under non-gastroenterologists had a higher in-hospital mortality rate (1.1 vs 0.2%, p&lt;0.0001) but a similar in-hospital colectomy rate (5.4 vs 4.9%, p=0.69) as compared to UC patients admitted under gastroenterologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following covariate adjustment, non-gastroenterologist care was associated with a greater in-hospital mortality risk relative to gastroenterologist care (adjusted OR (aOR) 3.28, 95% CI 1.03 to 10.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This increased mortality risk was observed in patients admitted to other internists (OR 5.49, 95% CI 1.75 to 17.2) and general practitioners (OR 6.02, 95% CI 1.84 to 19.7), with a trend towards greater mortality risk among patients admitted to general surgeons (OR 3.49, 95% CI 0.90 to 13.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients who were discharged from hospital colectomy-free, those who were admitted under non-gastroenterologists had a greater one-year risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> than patients who were admitted under gastroenterologists (adjusted HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.26 to 3.40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The type of hospital provider did not impact in-hospital or one-year colectomy risks or the risk of hospital re-admission in this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Primary in-hospital gastroenterologist care was associated with decreased in-hospital and one-year mortality risks among hospitalised UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Optimised care strategies by experienced specialists may confer important health advantages in this patient population </plain></SENT>
