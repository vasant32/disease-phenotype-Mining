<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> in which the colonic mucosa is infiltrated with plasma cells producing IgG autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is not known whether this represents a local mucosal response which has switched to IgG or a peripheral response which may have been initiated by peripheral antigen which homed to the colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clonal distribution of IgG secreting cells and isotype switched variants in UC is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To investigate the clonal distribution of mucosal IgG in UC and to search for related IgG and IgA secreting cells in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and diseased mucosa and blood in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate characteristics which may discriminate between the mucosal and peripheral repertoire in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa and in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Blood and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and diseased mucosa from two patients with UC were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunoglobulin gene analysis and clone specific polymerase chain reaction were used to study the clonal distribution and characteristics of IgG and related IgA in the mucosa and blood of patients with UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The IgG response in the mucosa of UC patients included widespread clones of cells that were present in both the diseased mucosa and blood but that were scarce in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clonally related IgA class switch variants, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> IgA1, were detected but also only in the diseased mucosa and blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that these clones home preferentially to the diseased mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We showed that J(H)1 usage was characteristic of the peripheral repertoire, and that examples of J(H)1 usage were observed in mucosal IgG in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these data are consistent with a model of UC in which a peripheral response is expressed and expanded in the colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
