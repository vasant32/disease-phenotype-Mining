<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Processes of care can be complex, and outcomes of care may vary across different healthcare delivery settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with IBD are managed over long periods of time and often by the same physician within a single care delivery system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> have variable courses of disease progression that require changes in therapy over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These factors necessitate multiple areas of potential assessment and improvement of processes and outcomes of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A current initiative is the development of quality measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The American Gastroenterological Association has developed accountability measures for the Physician Quality Reporting System, and the Crohn's and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>Colitis</z:hpo> Foundation of America has developed a set of top 10 recommended processes and outcomes of measurement for high-quality care of patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the pediatric ImproveCareNow collaborative network has collected improvement data from dozens of pediatric centers over the past 5 years and has demonstrated improvement in overall disease activity in their cohort through iterative quality improvement processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Future directions for quality indicators for adults with IBD will involve implementation of quality-measure reporting, both for purposes of reimbursement as well as improvement of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These strategies will need to be closely monitored to evaluate the effect of improvement programs on outcomes </plain></SENT>
