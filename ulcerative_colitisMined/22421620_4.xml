<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the role of serpin B1 in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> by using clinical samples and an experimental model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The colonic expression of serpin B1 was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Western blot analysis, and immunohistological studies in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and inflamed mucosa from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serpin B1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was determined by real-time PCR in the mouse <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32149">sodium sulfate</z:chebi> (DSS)-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Young adult mouse colonic epithelial (YAMC) cells were used to determine the role of serpin B1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serpin B1 gene transfected YAMC cells were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> to measure cell viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of NE was determined in YAMC cells treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NE-silenced YAMC cells were also treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> and then measured for viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Upregulated expression of serpin B1 in colonic mucosa was confirmed from patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies showed that serpin B1 expression was localized not only in inflammatory infiltration cells but also in epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serpin B1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was also increased in colonic mucosa of mouse DSS-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Serpin B1-transfected YAMC cells were resistant against the treatment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> treatment significantly induced NE in YAMC cells, and NE-silenced YAMC cells were also resistant against the treatment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that serpin B1 may be a novel marker of active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
