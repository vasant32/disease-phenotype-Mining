<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As we begin to understand the benefits conferred to the intestine by the microflora, the notion of modifying the composition of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> load to improve human health has arisen </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This article will begin with an overview of the role of the commensal microflora in maintaining mucosal immune homeostasis, and how a dysregulated immune response to the intestinal microflora results in IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This will be followed by a summary of the use of probiotics and prebiotics in experimental and human IBD </plain></SENT>
