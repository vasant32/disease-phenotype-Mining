<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microbial antigen handling by dendritic cells (DC) is believed to be of critical importance for immunity and tolerance in IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim was to characterize the effects of Sb on DC from IBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Highly purified (&gt;95%), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi>-stimulated CD1c(+)CD11c(+)CD123(-) myeloid DC (mDC) from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC; n = 36), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD; n = 26), or infectious controls (IC; n = 4) were cultured in the presence or absence of fungal supernatant from Sb (SbS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phenotype and cytokine production and/or secretion of IBD mDC were measured by flow cytometry and cytometric bead arrays, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> and proliferation were assessed in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) with allogenic CD4(+)CD45RA(+) naïve T cells from healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mucosal healing was investigated in epithelial wounding and migration assays with IEC-6 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SbS significantly decreased the frequency of CD40-, CD80-, and CD197 (CCR7; chemokine receptor-7)-expressing IBD mDC and reduced their secretion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 while increasing IL-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the MLR, SbS significantly inhibited T cell proliferation induced by IBD mDC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, SbS inhibited T(H)1 (TNF-α and interferon-γ) polarization induced by UC mDC and promoted IL-8 and transforming growth factor-β-dependent mucosal healing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, we provide novel evidence of synergistic mechanisms how Sb controls <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (inhibition of T cell costimulation and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-associated migration and mobilization of DC) and promotes epithelial restitution relevant in IBD </plain></SENT>
