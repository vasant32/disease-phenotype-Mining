<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their primary task is to absorb nutrients present in the intestinal lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, IEC also play an important role in the immune defence of our body by building a barrier that separates the bowel wall from potentially hazardous bacteria present in the gut lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The life cycle of IEC is determined by the time span in which cells migrate from their place of origin at the crypt base to the villus tip, from where they are shed into the lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the intestinal epithelium has to be tightly regulated and irregularities might cause pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Excessive cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> has been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> as seen in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While until recently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was discussed as being essential for epithelial turnover and tissue homeostasis in the intestinal epithelium, recent data using gene deficient mice have challenged this concept </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-independent mode of programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, termed necroptosis, has been identified and described in the intestinal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The following article reviews previous studies on cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> regulation in IEC and a potential role of necroptosis for gut homeostasis </plain></SENT>
