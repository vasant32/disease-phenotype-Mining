<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 222 patients with CD (135 females, 87 males; average age, 35.8+/-11.8 years; range 17-81 years) and 88 patients with UC (39 females, 49 males; average age, 37.2+/-13.6 years; range 16-81 years) underwent clinical and ultrasound examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Besides age, sex and degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, patients' CIBD specific parameters, including duration and extent of disease and prior operations were documented and evaluated statistically using logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947622" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gallbladder stone</z:e> disease in patients with CD was 13% (n = 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only age could be shown to be an independent risk factor (P = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to a collective representative for the general population in the same geographic region, the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947622" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cholecystolithiasis</z:e> was higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> corresponding age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with UC showed an overall prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947622" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gallbladder stone</z:e> disease of only 4.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Disease-specific factors such as duration and extent of disease, and prior surgery are independent risk factors for the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947622" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cholecystolithiasis</z:e> in patients with CIBD </plain></SENT>
