<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This 8-week, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (NCT00385736), conducted at 94 centres in North America and Europe, enrolled ambulatory adult patients with Mayo score of ≥ 6 points and endoscopic subscore of ≥ 2 points despite treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and/or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under the original study protocol, 186 patients were randomised (1:1) to subcutaneous treatment with ADA160/80 (160 mg at week 0, 80 mg at week 2, 40 mg at weeks 4 and 6) or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, at the request of European regulatory authorities, the protocol was amended to include a second induction group (ADA80/40: 80 mg at week 0, 40 mg at weeks 2, 4 and 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy endpoint was clinical remission (Mayo score ≤ 2 with no individual subscore &gt;1) at week 8, assessed in 390 patients randomised (1:1:1) to ADA160/80, ADA80/40, or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Safety was assessed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> enrolled patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients, study site personnel, investigators, and the sponsor were blinded to treatment assignment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At week 8, 18.5% of patients in the ADA160/80 group (p = 0.031 vs placebo) and 10.0% in the ADA80/40 group (p = 0.833 vs placebo) were in remission, compared with 9.2% in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serious adverse events occurred in 7.6%, 3.8% and 4.0% of patients in the placebo, ADA80/40, and ADA160/80 groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> in the placebo group, none in the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e> and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ADA160/80 was safe and effective for induction of clinical remission in patients with moderately to severely active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> failing treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and/or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
