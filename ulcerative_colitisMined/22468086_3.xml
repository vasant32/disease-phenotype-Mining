<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 19-item survey was distributed to subscribers of the pediatric gastroenterology (PEDSGI) listserv </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Responses were submitted anonymously and results compiled in a secure website </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 113 subscribers (88% based in the United States) responded (101 pediatric gastroenterology attendings and 12 pediatric gastroenterology fellows) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 46% in academic medical institutions and 39% in hospital-based practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority (91%) were treating &gt;10 patients with UC; 13% were treating &gt;100 patients with UC; 91% had prescribed infliximab (IFX) 5 mg/kg for UC; 72% had prescribed IFX 10 mg/kg for UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using a 5-point Likert scale, factors that influenced the decision not to increase IFX dosing in patients with UC included: "improvement on initial dose of IFX" (mean: 3.88) and "decision to move to colectomy" (3.69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lowest mean Likert scores were: "lack of guidelines or literature regarding increased IFX dosing" (1.96) and "insurance authorization or other insurance issues" (2.34). "Insurance authorization or other insurance issues" was identified by 39% as at least somewhat of a factor (Likert score â‰¥ 3) in their decision not to increase the IFX dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IFX 10 mg/kg was more commonly used for the treatment of pediatric UC among responders based in the United States (75/100) compared to non-United States responders (6/13, P = 0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Induction of remission was reported by 78% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> responders and 81% reported maintenance of remission with IFX 10 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One responder reported one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> with IFX 10 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IFX 10 mg/kg is more commonly used in the United States to treat pediatric UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Efficacy and safety data are required to avoid insurance barriers for its use </plain></SENT>
