<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To characterise T cell subsets, their state of activation, and production of cytokines in inflamed and non-inflamed pouches in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">familial adenomatous polyposis</z:e> (FAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The influence of T cell activation on mucosal transformation was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Mucosal biopsy specimens were taken from 42 patients with IAP (33 with UC and nine with FAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mononuclear cells were isolated by standard techniques and characterised by three colour flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) production was studied using the ELISPOT technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients with UC with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> there was a significant increase in the CD4:CD8 ratio, expression of activation markers on CD3+ cells, and number of IFNgamma producing mononuclear cells compared with patients with UC without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> (CD4:CD8 ratio 1.3 (range 0.7-2.7) versus 0.6 (0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>1-1.0), p=0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, a positive correlation between increased crypt depth and the number of CD4+ cells (r=0.57) was shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The observed increase in activated mucosal CD4+ T cells and IFN-gamma production might lead to mucosal destruction and crypt <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> as seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
