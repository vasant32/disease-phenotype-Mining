<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Disease flare in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) can result in substantial cost implications to the NHS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While the costs associated with treatment and management of UC are well-documented, estimates of the cost of flare are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A cost analysis was performed to construct a model to estimate the costs associated with managing a flare across variable pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A decision tree model was developed in Excel to estimate the direct medical costs of flares of various clinical severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within the model, the baseline UC patient cohort was maintained on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">Asacol</z:chebi>(®) (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi>) at a maximum dose of 2.4 g/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Simplified care pathways were mapped, assuming that patients would either be treated and managed in primary care, or as an outpatient, or admitted to hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taking a conservative approach, costs for surgery and other procedures e.g., stoma care were excluded as these outcomes are rare and inclusion would significantly increase average flare cost estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment and management strategies were based on best practice guidelines, published data sources and clinical expert opinion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Drug costs were calculated using the British National Formulary (BNF) and healthcare management costs were based on published unit costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relative proportions of patients likely to follow each route of the treatment pathway were estimated and weightings were applied to enable calculation of an average cost of flare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The estimated annual cost to manage a patient with UC in remission was £955 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The estimated cost to control a flare in primary care was £175 and for secondary care outpatient management was £578 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For secondary care inpatient management, the estimated cost was £3488 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>If a biologic/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">ciclosporin</z:chebi> was needed, the estimated cost rose to £4272 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> costs were inclusive of clinical investigations and treatment reviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The proportions of patients managed via each pathway were applied to calculations resulting in an estimated average cost of flare of £984 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A model was developed, based on simplified decision tree pathways to enable estimation of the cost of flare in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Depending on the severity of the flare episode, costs ranged from £175 to £4272 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In the future, this model can be used for economic evaluations of interventions to reduce the risk of flare in UC and to help understand the costly aspects of managing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
