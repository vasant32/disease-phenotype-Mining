<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The mechanisms involved in the initiation and maintenance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated an increased number of infiltrating CD4+ T cells within the inflammatory affected bowel wall in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Novel therapy approaches using anti-CD4 antibodies are thought to be effective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Interleukin 16 (IL-16) has been characterised as a chemokine with selective chemoattraction for CD4+ inflammatory T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, cellular expression of IL-16 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Expression of IL-16 was analysed in tissue samples of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls by applying reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, non-radioactive in situ hybridisation, and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Double staining methods were used to characterise cells expressing IL-16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The amount of infiltrating CD4+ cells was determined by immunohistochemistry and correlated with the corresponding IL-16+ cell number by step sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An increased number of IL-16+ cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> in comparison with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and control probes was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IL-16 was expressed by CD4 and CD8 positive T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, in active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> there was a substantial number of IL-16 positive mast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The increased number of CD4+ lymphocytes correlated positively with the increased number of IL-16 positive cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that increased expression of IL-16 in T cells and mast cells in active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> is associated with increased numbers of CD4+ lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Local expression of IL-16 seems to play a significant role in the initiation and persistence of the inflammatory process in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, presumably by IL-16 mediated recruitment of CD4+ cells, mostly lymphocytes, into the bowel wall </plain></SENT>
