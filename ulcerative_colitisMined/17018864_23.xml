<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Even though <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is a traditional tool for the induction of <z:mp ids='MP_0005407'>hyperalgesia</z:mp> in many tissues, recent observations suggest that not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> inflammatory processes produce this change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tolerance to colorectal distension (CRD) is reduced in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> but is increased in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the nature of the inflammatory infiltrate influences visceral perception </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: To test this hypothesis by assessing responses to CRD in mice with mild, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100281'>chronic colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CRD responses were measured in mice with mild non-specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="32149">sodium sulphate</z:chebi> (DSS)-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100281'>chronic colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Responses were compared with tissue infiltrate and damage, interleukin (IL)1beta and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and substance P, beta-endorphin and micro opioid receptor (MOR) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mild and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100282'>acute colitis</z:hpo> were associated with increased responsiveness to CRD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, CRD responses were not increased in mice with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100281'>chronic colitis</z:hpo> and this difference was not due to altered colonic wall compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MPO and IL1beta levels were greater in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100281'>chronic colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Larger increases in tissue substance P were seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> DSS, whereas CD4 T cells, beta-endorphin and MOR expression were evident only in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100281'>chronic colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An inverse correlation was seen between substance P and MOR in these tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100282'>Acute colitis</z:hpo> increased responsiveness to CRD and is accompanied by an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> inflammatory infiltrate and increased tissue substance P </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> DSS is accompanied by an increase in beta-endorphin and MOR expression, and CD4 T cells, but no change in compliance or CRD responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> generates <z:mp ids='MP_0005407'>hyperalgesia</z:mp>, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> involves infiltration by lymphocytes accompanied by MOR and beta-endorphin up regulation, and this provides an antinociceptive input that restores <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> visceral perception </plain></SENT>
