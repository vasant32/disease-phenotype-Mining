<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CRP levels were measured in 39 children with IBD undergoing colonoscopy [median age 12.8 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) n = 20], in 22 other children with IBD followed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> response to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi>, and in 33 paediatric non-IBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When standard CRP level was below detection limit (&lt; 5 mg/L), hs-CRP was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-four percent (25/39) of the children with IBD undergoing colonoscopy displayed undetectable (&lt; 5 mg/L) standard CRP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, the hs-CRP measurement could not differentiate between active (median, 0.2 mg/L, range, 0.007-1.37, n = 17) or quiescent (0.1 mg/L, 0.01-1.89, n = 8, P = NS) disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with ileocolonic CD had higher CRP levels (14 mg/L, 0.06-45, n = 13) than patients with no ileal involvement (0.18 mg/L, 0.01-9, n = 7, P &lt; 0.01) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) (0.13 mg/L, 0.007-23, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In children with active IBD treated with systemic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi>, the standard CRP was undetectable in 59% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hs-CRP levels did not differ between patients that responded to steroid therapy and in non-responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The measurement of hs-CRP did not prove useful in the assessment of disease activity or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> treatment in paediatric IBD patients that had undetectable standard CRP </plain></SENT>
