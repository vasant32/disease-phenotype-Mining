<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Those who have had an appendicectomy have a reduced risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the effect of appendicectomy on disease activity in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the Danish National Patient Registry to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> incident cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in Denmark during the period 1981 to 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 202 had an appendicectomy after their first admission with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these patients, we compared the incidence rate of hospitalisations with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> as first diagnosis during the period between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and appendicectomy, with the rate of such hospitalisations after appendicectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To adjust for the clinical course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> unrelated to appendicectomy, we extracted a reference cohort (n = 808), matched to the index subjects with respect to age, sex, and year of first admission, but with an intact appendix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rate of admission with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> as first diagnosis decreased by 47% after appendicectomy (rate ratio 0.53 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36-0.80)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the reference cohort showed a similar decline in admission rate (rate ratio 0.51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus appendicectomy had no apparent beneficial effect on admission rate after adjustment for the clinical course of disease unrelated to appendicectomy (adjusted rate ratio 1.05 (95% CI 0.67-1.67)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Appendicectomy had no significant beneficial effect on admission rates in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
