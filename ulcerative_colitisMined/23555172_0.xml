<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 1308 patients with UC and 1308 age-matched and sex-matched controls were prospectively studied in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The UC cases were collected from 17 hospitals in China from April 2007 to April 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Uniform questionnaires were designed to investigate risk factors including smoking, appendectomy, stress, socio-economic conditions, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>), oral contraceptives, diet, breastfeeding, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and family sanitary conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group comparisons by each factor were done using simple logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conditional logistic regression was used for multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By univariate analysis, the variables predictive of UC included feeling stress, light and heavy alcoholic drinking, spicy food, sugar consumption and infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, while heavy tea intake and tap water consumption were protective against UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, the protective factor for UC was tap water consumption [odds ratios (OR) = 0.424, 95%CI: 0.302-0.594, P &lt; 0.001]; while the potential risk factors for UC were heavy sugar consumption (OR = 1.632, 95%CI: 1.156-2.305, P &lt; 0.001), spicy food (light intake: OR = 3.329, 95%CI: 2.282-4.857, P &lt; 0.001; heavy intake: OR = 3.979, 95%CI: 2.700-5.863, P &lt; 0.001), and often feeling stress (OR = 1.981, 95%CI: 1.447-2.711, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other factors, such as smoking habit, appendectomy, breastfeeding, a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025007" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">measles</z:e>, rural or urban residence, education, oral contraceptives, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use have not been found to have a significant association with the development of UC in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study showed tap water consumption was a protective factor for UC, while spicy food, heavy sugar consumption and often feeling stress were risk factors for UC in this Chinese population </plain></SENT>
