<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endoscopic tri-modal imaging (ETMI) incorporates white light endoscopy (WLE), autofluorescence imaging (AFI) and narrow-band imaging (NBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To assess the value of ETMI for the detection and classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in patients with longstanding <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Randomised comparative trial of tandem colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Academic Medical Centre Amsterdam, Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> underwent surveillance colonoscopy with ETMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each colonic segment was inspected twice, once with AFI and once with WLE, in random order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> detected lesions were inspected by NBI for Kudo pit pattern analysis and additional random biopsies were taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Neoplasia</z:hpo> miss-rates of AFI and WLE, and accuracy of the Kudo classification by NBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among patients assigned to inspection with AFI first (n = 25), 10 neoplastic lesions were primarily detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subsequent WLE detected no additional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among patients examined with WLE first (n = 25), three neoplastic lesions were detected; subsequent inspection with AFI added three neoplastic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Neoplasia</z:hpo> miss-rates for AFI and WLE were 0% and 50% (p = 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The Kudo classification by NBI had a sensitivity and specificity of 75% and 81%; however, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was coloured purple on AFI (sensitivity 100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No additional patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> were detected by random biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Autofluorescence imaging improves the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and decreases the yield of random biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Pit pattern analysis by NBI has a moderate accuracy for the prediction of histology, whereas AFI colour appears valuable in excluding the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
