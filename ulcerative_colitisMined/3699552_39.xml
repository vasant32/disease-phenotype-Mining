<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Compared with 17 control subjects, nine patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> exhibited marked decreases in net <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> absorption and rectal pd, while these transport parameters were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in six patients with inactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intravenous administration of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi> hemisuccinate (100 mg) resulted five hours later in significant and quantitatively similar increases in net <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> and water absorption and pd in nine control subjects, seven patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and six patients with inactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intravenous administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> phosphate (40 mg) to eight control subjects produced increases in net <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> and water absorption and pd five hours later, which did not differ significantly from those produced by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi>; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> induced similar changes in two patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
