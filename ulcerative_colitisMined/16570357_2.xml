<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety Mexican mestizo patients (45 females) with UC, confirmed by biopsy, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High resolution HLA typing was performed by PCR-SSO reverse dot blot and PCR-SSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Molecular typing techniques were applied to define HLA-DRB1 alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescence techniques were used to detect p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-eight (53%) UC patients were positive for p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> by ELISA and IF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi>-positive UC patients had a significantly increased frequency of HLA-DR7 compared with p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi>-negative controls (22% vs 5.1%; pC=0.02, OR=5.2, CI 95%: 1.06-37.82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was scored as severe in 20 patients, moderate in 8, mild in 14 and no activity in the remaining 38 patients according to the Truelove and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271977" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Witts</z:e> criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis showed a significantly increased frequency of the HLA-DRB1*07 allele in 15 of 20 UC patients with severe activity of UC and p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> positivity [100% vs 0%; pC=0.0000001; OR=35] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> positive patients, HLA-DR alleles and other clinical features such as extraintestinal manifestations, proctocolectomy and extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The HLA-DRB1*07 is associated with p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> positive UC Mexican patients </plain></SENT>
