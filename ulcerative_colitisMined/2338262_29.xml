<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to study the effects of smoking on mucosal immunity, salivary immunoglobulins were measured in pure parotid saliva from groups of healthy non-smokers, smokers, and exsmokers and from patients with epithelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018671" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">head and neck tumours</z:e>, both untreated and after radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the healthy individuals, smokers had significantly lower salivary IgA and higher IgM concentrations than did non-smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect on IgA was dose related, and reversible after cessation of smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Likewise, in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018671" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">head and neck tumours</z:e> (the majority being smokers), salivary IgA concentration was reduced and IgM increased when compared with non-smoking controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results were similar before and after radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study provides evidence of the effects of smoking on mucosal immunity as evaluated by parotid salivary immunoglobulins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies of the influence of smoking on secretory immunity are indicated </plain></SENT>
