<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By the turbidometric method, values of lysozyme (microgram/ml +/- SD) are considerably greater in the serum of patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (9.2 +/- 2.7) than in the serum of healthy controls (4.4 +/- 2.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They do not, however, distinguish individual patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> from those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> nor from those with a variety of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947761" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal conditions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lysoplate method gives much higher values for serum lysozyme than the turbidometric method but there is a considerable overlap between the results for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (60.1 +/- 30.7) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (27.4 +/- 17.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is only a moderate correlation between the results given by the two methods (r = 0.56) and it is suggested that factors other than enzyme activity and methodological variation are responsible for the observed differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is supported by the finding that, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> in remission, serum lysozyme values (lysoplate) return to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values but with the turbidometric method remain raised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean faecal lysozyme levels, expressed either as a concentration or as total daily excretion, in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> are very significantly greater than values in healthy controls and in diseased subjects without diarrhoea but are not significantly different from those subjects with other causes of diarrhoea </plain></SENT>
