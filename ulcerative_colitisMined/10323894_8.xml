<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> with sulphasalazine causes several adverse effects, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sulphasalazine is cleaved by colonic bacteria into <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="132842">sulphapyridine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Received wisdom was that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi> was topically active, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="132842">sulphapyridine</z:chebi> was absorbed and caused immunoallergic side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">Mesalazine</z:chebi>, a slow release formulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi>, was expected to be a safe alternative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, several cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 65 year old man had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>increased liver enzymes</z:hpo>, anti-nuclear and anti-smooth muscle autoantibodies and IgG levels, and lesions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> after 21 months of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo> had been identified eight months earlier, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> rather than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> had been withdrawn, without any improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, liver enzyme and IgG levels became <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and autoantibodies disappeared after discontinuation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Contrary to initial expectations, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> can cause most of the sulphasalazine induced adverse effects, and hepatic side effects may be almost as frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo> occurs, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> administration should be discontinued to avoid the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003333'>liver fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
