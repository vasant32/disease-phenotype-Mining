<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> were colonised less frequently and with lower numbers of E coli than were control patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the distribution of adherent strains between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> patient groups or with disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>E coli from the control patients were marginally less adhesive than those from colitics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hydrophobicity of isolates did not differ significantly between colitic and control groups nor were there significant differences correlated with disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, for these mucosal E coli isolates, hydrophobicity and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> resistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> were unrelated characteristics </plain></SENT>
