<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The positive findings that supplement those obtained by light microscopy are: a prominent nucleolus is more common in the lymphocytes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes or those found in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>; lymphocytes are often observed close to macrophages and epithelioid cells; the epithelioid cells are metabolically active, and have vesicles which contain acid phosphatase but little visible debris; intramural bacteria were identified in six of the 11 specimens of colon with intact epithelia and minimal inflammatory changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The possible significance of these findings for the pathogenesis of the disease is discussed </plain></SENT>
