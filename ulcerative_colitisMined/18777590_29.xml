<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These local immune responses require a tight control, the outcome of which is in most cases the induction of tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Local T cell immunity is an important compartment of the specific intestinal immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T cell reactivity is programmed during the initial stage of its activation by professional presenting cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mucosal dendritic cells (DCs) are assumed to play key roles in regulating immune responses in the antigen-rich gastrointestinal environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mucosal DCs are a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> population that can either initiate (innate and adaptive) immune responses, or control <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> and maintain tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Defects in this regulation are supposed to lead to the two major forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This review will discuss the emerging role of mucosal DCs in regulating <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> and immune responses </plain></SENT>
