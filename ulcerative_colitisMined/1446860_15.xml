<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected twins were in clinical remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Paired immunofluorescence staining of the rectal mucosa showed that those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> had a significantly higher (p &lt; 0.01) proportion of IgG1 producing mucosal immunocytes than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (78.1% v 55.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the IgG2 cell fraction was significantly reduced (15.9% v 34.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Healthy twins from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> pairs tended to show a raised proportion of IgG1 cells and the IgG2 cell fraction was significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In discordant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> twin pairs, no difference appeared in the cellular IgG subclass pattern between healthy and affected twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the proportion of IgG1 in these healthy and diseased twins showed good correlation (T = 0.867) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results in rectal mucosa of twins with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> were widely scattered and affected twins did not differ significantly from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Healthy twins, however, showed a marginally raised IgG1 cell proportion, but no correlation was seen between the IgG subclass fractions in discordant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> twin pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The serum concentrations of IgG1 and IgG2 did not differ from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls in twins of either category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, the aberrant mucosal production of IgG1 and IgG2 does not depend on active disease, but is apparently at least partially explained by a genetic impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the mucosal IgG subclass pattern in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> appears to be determined mainly by exogenous variables </plain></SENT>
