<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The steady state levels of c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> have been measured in <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> samples extracted from colonoscopic biopsies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> patients obtained at routine endoscopy sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen limiting the ischaemic time to less than 15 seconds, and can be stored for up to 96 hours before separation of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Yields of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> using biopsies were 0.137 (0.041)% wet wt (mean (SD), n = 68), these are significantly better than those obtained from surgical material (0.064 (0.063)% wet wt (mean (SD), n = 21) where the tissue ischaemic time was 45 minutes to one hour 40 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functional activity of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> extracted was demonstrated by the ability to direct in vitro protein translation in the rabbit reticulocyte system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have used this technique to show that there is an increased ratio of steady state c-myc proto-oncogene expression in inflamed tissue from 18 patients with left sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and five patients with segmental Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, compared with an uninvolved region of the colon in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No difference in c-myc expression was seen in biopsies at least 30 cm apart in 11 control patients with no macroscopic or histological abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased expression of c-myc in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> is consistent with the activation of this proto-oncogene during altered cell cycle control resulting from the inflammatory process </plain></SENT>
