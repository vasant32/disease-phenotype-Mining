<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: The intestinal immune system faces large amounts of antigens, and its regulation is tightly balanced by cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the effect of intestinal flow diversion on spontaneous secretion of interleukin (IL)-4 and interferon (IFN)- gamma was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight patients (two with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, four with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and two with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>) carrying a double lumen small bowel stoma after a total colectomy procedure were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For each patient, eight biopsy samples were taken endoscopically from both the diverted and non-diverted part of the small bowel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs) were isolated separately and assayed for numbers of cells spontaneously secreting IL-4 and/or IFN-gamma by an ELISPOT technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the non-diverted mucosa, a significant decrease in the number of spontaneously IFN-gamma secreting CD3 lymphocytes was observed in the diverted small bowel mucosa among both IELs (p = 0.008) and LPLs (p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The same results, although less significant, were obtained for IL-4, especially in LPLs (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The intestinal content influences the spontaneous secretion of IFN-gamma and IL-4 by intestinal lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results could help to elucidate the anti-inflammatory role of split ileostomy in patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
