<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The histological appearances in the reservoir mucosa were followed up in 60 of 109 survivors over 19-173 months (median 97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median number of biopsy specimens taken per patient was six with a range of 3-13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These were examined by one pathologist (ICT) unaware of the clinical details using a scoring system previously described to assess the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between the degree of severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> changes (r = 0.6192, p &lt; 0.000001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and the following variables: preoperative duration of disease, presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in the original operative specimen, extra-alimentary manifestations or the type of reservoir </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation between severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and male sex was found (p &lt; 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 60 patients could be divided into three groups based on the severity and fluctuation of histological <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In group A (n = 27, 45%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> changes were minor and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was never seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In group B (n = 25, 42%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> changes were more severe and there were transient episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In group C (n = 8, 13%) severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> were constantly present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Differentiation of the three groups had clearly occurred within six months from closure of the ileostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients in group C could be identified on histological criteria within weeks of closure of the ileostomy and were those exclusively at risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
