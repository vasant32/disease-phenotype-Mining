<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the probable role of soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1) in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-eight patients were enrolled; nineteen healthy volunteers served as controls; 8 patients were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, and 31 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical and endoscopic activity indexes of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> respectively were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Upon admission blood was sampled; sTREM-1 and TNFalpha were measured by an immunoassay and malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) by the thiobarbitourate assay, after passage through an HPLC system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median +/- SE of TNFalpha of controls, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> were 6.02 +/- 3.94, 7.98 +/- 5.08 (P = NS vs controls), and 8.45 +/- 4.15 ng/L (P = 0.018 vs controls) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Respective values of sTREM-1 were 53.31 +/- 32.93, 735.10 +/- 197.17 (P = 0.008 vs controls) and 435.82 +/- 279.71 ng/L (P = 0.049 vs controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>sTREM-1 was positively correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> activity index and clinical and endoscopic activity indexes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (P = 0.002, 0.001 and 0.009, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>sTREM-1 of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> was positively correlated with TNFalpha (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: sTREM-1 seems to behave as a novel mediator in IBD in correlation with the degree of the inflammatory reaction of the intestinal mucosa </plain></SENT>
