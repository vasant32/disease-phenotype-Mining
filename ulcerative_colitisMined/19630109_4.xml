<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine if <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) is a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> in adult Sri Lankans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified eligible subjects from among consecutive patients diagnosed with IBD who attended our outpatient clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We included only patients aged between 20 and 70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who were pregnant, had significant comorbidity, or were on calcium supplements or treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> within the past 6 mo, were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Healthy, age- and sex-matched controls were also recruited, in a control to patient ratio of 3:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both groups were screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> using peripheral dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study population consisted of 111 IBD patients (male:female = 43:68; mean age 42.5 years) and 333 controls (male:female = 129:204; mean age 43.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> among IBD patients (13.5%) was significantly higher than among controls (4.5%) (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> was not significantly different between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (14.45%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (10.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, on multivariate analysis, only age (P = 0.001), menopause (P = 0.024) and use of systemic steroids (P &lt; 0.001) were found to be associated independently with the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo>, while IBD, severity of disease, number of relapses, duration of illness or treatment other than systemic steroids were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IBD does not appear to be an independent risk factor for the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the use of systemic steroids was a risk factor </plain></SENT>
