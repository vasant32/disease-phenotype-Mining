<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immune-related extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) are usually related to disease activity, but sometimes may take an independent course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Globally, about one third of patients develop these systemic manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic classification shows that certain subsets of patients are more susceptible to developing EIMs, which frequently occur simultaneously in the same patient overlapping joints, skin, mouth, and eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical spectrum of these manifestations varies from mild transitory to very severe lesions, sometimes more incapacitating than the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal disease</z:e> itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The great majority of these EIMs accompany the activity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal disease</z:e> and patients run a higher risk of a severe clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For most of the inflammatory EIMs, the primary therapeutic target remains the bowel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early aggressive therapy can minimize severe complications and maintenance treatment has the potential to prevent some devastating consequences </plain></SENT>
