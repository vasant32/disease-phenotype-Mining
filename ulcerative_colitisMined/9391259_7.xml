<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A large number of monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date no twin pair has developed phenotypically discordant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This case report is the first documented occurrence of discordant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> occurring in monozygotic twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: Twenty two year old identical male twins presented within three months of each other with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> that proved to be discordant in overall disease type, disease distribution, clinical course, and histopathological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twin 1 developed a severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0868908" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pancolitis</z:e> necessitating total colectomy while twin 2 developed a predominantly distal patchy <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> with frequent granulomas, controlled by aminosalicylates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twin 1 was antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi>) negative at the time of testing while twin 2 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>) was <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significantly, the twins possessed the HLA type DR3-DR52-DQ2 previously associated with extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case report confirms the important role played by genetic factors in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It also highlights the crucial role of undetermined environmental agents in dictating disease expression and phenotype </plain></SENT>
