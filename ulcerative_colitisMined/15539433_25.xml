<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Extracts from Boswellia serrata have been reported to have anti-inflammatory activity, primarily via boswellic acid-mediated inhibition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotriene</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In three small clinical trials, boswellia was shown to improve symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, and because of its alleged safety, boswellia was considered superior over <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> in terms of a benefit-risk evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of boswellia extracts in controlled settings of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34674">dextran sulfate</z:chebi>- or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48110">trinitrobenzene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29214">sulfonic acid</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that boswellia is ineffective in ameliorating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in these models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, individual boswellic acids were demonstrated to increase the basal and IL-1beta-stimulated NF-kappaB activity in intestinal epithelial cells in vitro as well as reverse proliferative effects of IL-1beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also observed hepatotoxic effect of boswellia with pronounced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>hepatomegaly</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hepatotoxity and increased <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> accumulation in response to boswellia were further confirmed in vitro in HepG2 cells with fluorescent Nile red binding/resazurin reduction assay and by confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microarray analyses of hepatic gene expression demonstrated dysregulation of a number of genes, including a large group of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism-related genes, and detoxifying enzymes, a response consistent with that to hepatotoxic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35703">xenobiotics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, boswellia does not ameliorate symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in chemically induced murine models and, in higher doses, may become hepatotoxic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Potential implications of prolonged and uncontrolled intake of boswellia as an herbal supplement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> and other inflammatory conditions should be considered in future clinical trials with this botanical </plain></SENT>
