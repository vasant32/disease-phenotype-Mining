<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine free and conjugated serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> (BA) levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) subgroups with defined clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Comprehensive serum BA profiling was performed in 358 IBD patients and 310 healthy controls by liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52023">hyodeoxycholic acid</z:chebi>, the CYP3A4-mediated detoxification product of the secondary BA <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16325">lithocholic acid</z:chebi> (LCA), was increased significantly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), while most other serum BA species were decreased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total BA, total BA conjugate, and total BA glycoconjugate levels were decreased only in CD, whereas total unconjugated BA levels were decreased only in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In UC patients with hepatobiliary manifestations, the conjugated primary BAs <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17687">glycocholic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28865">taurocholic acid</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36274">glycochenodeoxycholic acid</z:chebi> were as significantly increased as the secondary BAs LCA, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9907">ursodeoxycholic acid</z:chebi>, and tauroursodeoxycholic acid compared to UC patients without hepatobiliary manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, we found that in ileocecal resected CD patients, the unconjugated primary BAs, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16359">cholic acid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16755">chenodeoxycholic acid</z:chebi>, were increased significantly compared to controls and patients without surgical interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Serum BA profiling in IBD patients that indicates impaired intestinal barrier function and increased detoxification is suitable for advanced diagnostic characterization and differentiation of IBD subgroups with defined clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
