<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The abundance of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25676">oligopeptide</z:chebi> transporter (Pept-1) in the brush-border membrane of the intestinal epithelium is the central mechanism for regulation of transport of products of protein digestion (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46761">dipeptides</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47923">tripeptides</z:chebi>) and peptidomimetic drugs (for example, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35627">beta-lactam</z:chebi> antibiotics) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Within the past few years, there has been substantial progress in identifying the factors controlling this regulation and the mechanisms of their actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this report is to review this progress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The studies of individual substrates and hormones in a human intestinal cell line (Caco-2) have shown that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46761">dipeptides</z:chebi>, certain amino acids, insulin, and leptin increase and epidermal growth factor and triiodothyronine decrease the membrane population of Pept-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the case of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46761">dipeptides</z:chebi>, epidermal growth factor, and thyroid hormone, there are parallel changes in the gene expression brought about by alteration of transcription and/or stability of Pept-1 mRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the treatment with insulin and leptin does not induce any alteration in the Pept-1 gene expression, and the mechanism of increased protein expression appears to be increased trafficking from a preformed cytoplasmic pool to the apical membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo studies in rats have shown modulation of protein and gene expressions of the intestinal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25676">oligopeptide</z:chebi> transporter during the day and during development and in nutritional and metabolic alterations, such as high-protein diet, fasting, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal diseases</z:e>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036992" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">short-bowel syndrome</z:e>, may have induction of the Pept-1 expression in their colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, pharmacological studies have shown that the expression of Pept-1 can be upregulated by agents such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5 fluorouracil</z:chebi> and downregulated by agents such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the above studies have produced a wealth of new information on regulation of a key transporter in the intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This information may have useful applications in nutritional and pharmacological treatments, for example, in diabetic patients needing enteral nutrition or in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients needing the suppression of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
