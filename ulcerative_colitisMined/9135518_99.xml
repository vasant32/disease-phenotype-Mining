<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> are at risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005944" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic bone disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To compare bone mineral density in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> with patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and healthy subjects, and to evaluate possible risk factors for bone loss in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 60 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 60 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and 60 healthy subjects were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each group consisted of 24 men and 36 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total body bone mineral density were measured by dual x ray absorptiometry (DXA), and Z scores were obtained by comparison with age and sex matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean Z scores were significantly lower in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> compared with patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> had bone mineral densities similar to healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, body mass index (BMI), and sex were significant predictor variables for bone mineral density in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> only body mass index and sex were of significant importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Disease localisation and small bowel resections had no influence on bone mineral density in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> have <z:hpo ids='HP_0004349'>reduced bone mineral density</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Several factors are probably involved, but the reduction is associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When studying skeletal effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> should be evaluated separately </plain></SENT>
