<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, serum samples from 80 patients with UC were studied for the presence of various autoantibodies and soluble interleukin-2 receptor molecules (sIL-2Rs) in an attempt to determine the degree of activation of the immune system in this disease process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Autoantibodies detected included rheumatoid factors (in 5% of patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> (in 51.3%), anti-Ro(SSA) (in 1.3%), anticardiolipin antibodies (IgG and/or IgM classes in 26.3%), anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double stranded DNA</z:chebi> (IgG or IgM classes in 45%), and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCAs</z:chebi>, in 30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCAs</z:chebi> had a perinuclear pattern (p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi>) in 95.8%, without anti-myeloperoxidase activity, at least in an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Raised concentrations of sIL-2R were found in 32.5% of patients (26/80, 18 with active and eight with inactive UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean (SD) sIL-2R concentrations were significantly higher in patients with active UC (595 (219) u/ml v 406 (162) u/ml, p = 0.0001) and in patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCAs</z:chebi> (584 (177) u/ml in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> positive v 447 (212) u/ml in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> negative patients, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sIL-2R concentrations were correlated with increased serum concentrations of C3c (r = 0.23, p &lt; 0.05) or C4 (r = 0.4, p &lt; 0.001) components of the complement system and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, r = 0.44, p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Platelets, ESR, and C3c were not associated with disease activity (p = 0.06, 0.33 and 0.86) whereas mean (SD) serum concentrations of C4 were higher in active disease (37.4 (11.9) mg/dl v 32.3 (10.3) mg/dl, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sIL-2Rs had 53% sensitivity and 82.6% specificity for disease activity whereas platelet counts had 53% sensitivity and 58.7% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To conclude, UC is accompanied by an <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune response</z:mp> that results in the production of several autoantibodies and cellular immune activation, as shown by the high sIL-2R concentration, is also present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The identification of the target antigen(s) of p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> would possibly act as an indicator of disease activity if this distinct subset of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCAs</z:chebi> can be attributed to the pathogenesis of UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The sIL-2R concentrations seem to be a useful laboratory marker for assessing activity of the disease </plain></SENT>
