<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Inhibition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26274,32874">prolyl</z:chebi> hydroxylases (PHDs) leads to the induction of a transcriptional program that, in the gut, promotes intestinal epithelial cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PHD inhibitors have recently been suggested as a promising alternative treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we explored the colonic mucosal expression of the different PHD-isoforms (PHD1, 2 and 3) in order to identify the key isoform(s) involved in the pathogenesis of IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-8 and TNF-α), an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> marker (caspase 3) and PHD1, 2 and 3 was analysed in biopsies of IBD patients (UC and CD), patients with infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and healthy controls using qRT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PHD protein levels were evaluated using western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cellular localization of PHD 1, 2 and 3 was determined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PHD1 was significantly up-regulated in IBD patients, both at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (UC: p &lt; 0.0001 and CD: p &lt; 0.05) and at the protein level (UC: p &lt; 0.05 and CD: p &lt; 0.05), and showed a very good correlation with the expression of the inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and TNF-α and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> marker caspase 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Colonic mucosal PHD2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expressions were not altered in IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PHD3 expression was increased in inflamed biopsies from UC patients (p &lt; 0.0001), but only at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PHD1 and PHD2 expression was found both in the colonic lamina propria and the epithelium while PHD3 was mainly located in the endothelium of blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this exploratory expression analysis, PHD1 comes forward as the primary therapeutic target for UC and, to a lesser extent, for (colonic) CD </plain></SENT>
