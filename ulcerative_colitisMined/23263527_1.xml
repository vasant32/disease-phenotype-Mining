<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Many species within the phylum Firmicutes are thought to exert anti-inflammatory effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We quantified bacteria belonging to the genus Butyricicoccus in stools of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effect of Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum in a rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> model and analysed the ability to prevent cytokine-induced increases in epithelial permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A genus-specific quantitative PCR was used for quantification of Butyricicoccus in stools from patients with UC or CD and healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of B pullicaecorum on trinitrobenzenesulfonic (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi>)-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> was assessed and the effect of B pullicaecorum culture supernatant on epithelial barrier function was investigated in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average number of Butyricicoccus in stools from patients with UC and CD in active (UC: 8.61 log10/g stool; CD: 6.58 log10/g stool) and remission phase (UC: 8.69 log10/g stool; CD: 8.38 log10/g stool) was significantly lower compared with healthy subjects (9.32 log10/g stool) and correlated with disease activity in CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Oral administration of B pullicaecorum resulted in a significant protective effect based on macroscopic and histological criteria and decreased intestinal myeloperoxidase (MPO), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor α (TNFα) and interleukin (IL)-12 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Supernatant of B pullicaecorum prevented the loss of transepithelial resistance (TER) and the increase in IL-8 secretion induced by TNFα and interferon γ (IFN gamma) in a Caco-2 cell model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> have lower numbers of Butyricicoccus bacteria in their stools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Administration of B pullicaecorum attenuates <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in rats and supernatant of B pullicaecorum cultures strengthens the epithelial barrier function by increasing the TER </plain></SENT>
