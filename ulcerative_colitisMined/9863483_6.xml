<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Increased expression of CD44v6 on colonic crypt epithelial cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> has been suggested as a diagnostic tool to distinguish <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> from colonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To investigate colonic CD44v6 expression and serum concentrations of soluble CD44v6 (sCD44v6) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Colonic biopsy samples were obtained from 16 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, 13 with ileocolonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, and 10 undergoing polypectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum samples were obtained from 15 patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, 20 with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, and 20 healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colonic CD44v6 expression was evaluated immunohistochemically by monoclonal antibody 2F10 and the higher affinity monoclonal antibody VFF18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum sCD44v6 concentrations were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 2F10 stained colonic epithelium of inflamed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> samples in 80% and 40% of cases, respectively, and VFF18 in 95% and 87%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both monoclonal antibodies displayed a sensitivity and specificity of 60% and 87% to differentiate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> from colonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum concentrations of sCD44v6 were lower in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (median 153 ng/ml; interquartile range (IQR) 122-211) compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (219; IQR 180-243) and healthy donors (221; IQR 197-241 (p = 0.002)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Its sensitivity and specificity to discriminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> was 75% and 71%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Colonic CD44v6 and serum sCD44v6 concentrations do not facilitate reliable differential diagnosis between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
