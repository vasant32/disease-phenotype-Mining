<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In an epidemiological study of the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) in the county of Stockholm between 1955 and 1979, 1274 patients with UC were discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these patients had regularly been investigated with liver function tests; 142 (11%) of them showed signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267792" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatobiliary disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A follow up study on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 142 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>abnormal liver function</z:hpo> and UC was made between 1989 and 1991 to evaluate the cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001392'>liver abnormality</z:hpo> and to find out if the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> had affected the survival rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At follow up, eight patients were reclassified as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 60 had developed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> liver function as judged from test results, while the remaining 74 still had signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267792" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatobiliary disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most common explanation for a transient abnormality in liver function was active <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The temporary signs of liver injury were not associated with changes in survival rates for these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infections</z:e>, especially those because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B and C virus transmitted by blood transfusions accounted for the abnormalities in liver function in 21 patients, nine of which had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, but non-fatal course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty nine (2.3%) of the patients developed primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> (PSC), and 12 of them died during the study period four because of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_354'>cholangiocarcinoma</z:mpath> and eight because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>hepatic failure</z:hpo>; one patient had a transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The estimated median time of survival from the first presentation of evidence of a liver function, compatible with the diagnosis of PSC, to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or liver transplantation was 21 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A comparison of survival rates in patients with UC and patients with UC and concurrent PSC showed, a significant reduction in survival in the PSC group (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The number of patients with UC who developed PSC remained constant during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, although evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>abnormal liver function</z:hpo> is a common finding in UC, a spontaneous return to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels is common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this study, which did not have a selection bias, the median time of survival among PSC patients was far longer than previously described although development of PSC among patients with UC does significantly reduce the estimated median time of survival </plain></SENT>
