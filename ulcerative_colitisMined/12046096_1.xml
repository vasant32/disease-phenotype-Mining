<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 29 plasma specimens were obtained from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (male 13, female 16) aged 21-47 years (33+/-11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was assessed by Truelove-Writeria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with a score of above 5 were regarded as having active <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty healthy people(male 12, female 8) aged 19-53 years(31+/-14) served as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were taken from an antecubital vein puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood(1.8 mL) was injected into the tubes containing <z:chebi fb="2" ids="53258">sodium citrate</z:chebi> (0.13 mmol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 3000 r.min(-1) for 10 min, and stored at -80 degrees until assayed by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean plasma levels of DD and vWF in active UC patients were significantly higher than those of the controls (0.69+/-0.41 vs 0.27+/-0.11, P&lt;0.01 143+/-46 vs 103+/-35, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean plasma levels of DD in the patients with active disease were higher than those with inactive disease(0.69+/-0.41 vs 0.48+/-0.29 P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The levels of vWF were not different between active and inactive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DD levels were positively related to vWF levels( r =0.574, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between levels of DD and vWF and the scope of disease and sex of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: vWF is an important feature and a good marker of UC intravascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and endothelial cell dysfunction were found in UC patients and the combined test of DD and vWF is helpful to distinguish the activity of the UC patients </plain></SENT>
