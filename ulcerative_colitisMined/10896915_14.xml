<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we identified, by computer homology analysis, a specific <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (HIAEDADRK) in human TM that can bind to HLA-DPw9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of autoantibodies against this <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Antibodies were measured by ELISA with a synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> in 20 healthy volunteers, 48 patients with UC, 26 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), eight with primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> (PSC), and six with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002613'>biliary cirrhosis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PBC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The functional significance of antibodies was investigated by antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against DPw9 transfected L cells using a standard (51)Cr release assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Optical density values (mean (SD)) of sera from patients with UC (1.40 (0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>52)) and PSC (1.65 (0.12)) were significantly higher than those from healthy volunteers (0.32 (0.28)) (p&lt;0.05), CD (0.50 (0.34)) (p&lt;0.05) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PBC</z:e> (0.14 (0.09)) (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Values in UC decreased with clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ADCC activity of UC sera correlated well with antibody titre against this synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Anti-TM antibody was detected in UC sera by a specific <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> based ELISA with high reproducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> may be an antigenic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> of TM involved in the immunopathogenesis of UC and, perhaps, PSC </plain></SENT>
