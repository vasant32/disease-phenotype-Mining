<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To examine the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022104" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IBS">irritable bowel syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>), <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gall stones</z:mp> (GS), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcer</z:hpo> disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PUD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: The 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) and the National Child Development Study (NCDS) are two one week national birth cohorts born in 1970 and 1958, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cohort members living in Great Britain were interviewed in 1999/2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The prevalence rates of the five diseases were calculated, and associations with sex and childhood social class were investigated using logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At age 30 years, the prevalence rates per 10,000 (95% confidence interval (CI)) in the 1970 and 1958 cohorts, respectively, were: CD 38 (26-49), 21 (13-30); UC 30 (20-41), 27 (18-37); <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> 826 (775-877), 290 (267-330); GS 88 (71-106), 78 (62-94); and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PUD</z:e> 244 (214-273), 229 (201-256) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly higher proportion with CD (p=0.023) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> (p=0.000) in the 1970 cohort compared with the 1958 cohort at age 30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparing the cohorts in the 1999/2000 sweep, UC, GS, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PUD</z:e> were significantly (p=0.001, p=0.000, p=0.000) more common in the 1958 cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant trend for a higher risk of GS with lower social class in both cohorts combined (p=0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The study indicates an increasing temporal trend in the prevalence of CD and suggests a period effect in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>, possibly due to adult life exposures or variation in recognition and diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
