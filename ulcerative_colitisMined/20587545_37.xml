<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess whether IS co-treatment is useful in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) on scheduled IFX infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 121 consecutive patients with IBD (23 UC, 98 CD) treated by IFX and who received at least 6 months of IS co-treatment (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> (AZA) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX)) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each patient, the IFX treatment duration was divided into semesters which were independently analysed regarding IBD activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Semesters with IS (n=265) and without IS (n=319) were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IBD flares, perianal complications and switch to adalimumab were less frequently observed in semesters with IS than in those without IS (respectively: 19.3% vs 32.0%, p=0.003; 4.1% vs 11.8%, p=0.03; 1.1% vs 5.3%, p=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maximal C-reactive protein (CRP) level and IFX dose/kg observed during the semesters were lower in semesters with IS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within semesters with IS, IBD flares and perianal complications were less frequently observed in semesters with AZA than in those with MTX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, IS co-treatment was associated with a decreased risk of IBD flare (OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.79) CONCLUSION: In patients with IBD receiving IFX maintenance therapy, IS co-treatment is associated with reduced IBD activity, IFX dose and switch to adalimumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this setting, co-treatment with AZA seems to be more effective than co-treatment with MTX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Benefit of such a combination treatment has to be balanced with potential risks, notably <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
