<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Proctocolectomy with ileo-anal pouch (IAP) anastomosis is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e>, particularly in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to quantify MMP-1 and MMP-2 in inflamed and uninflamed pouches of patients with UC compared with those with active UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IAP patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">familial adenomatous polyposis</z:e> (FAP) served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Biopsies were taken from 33 patients with IAP (UC, n=25; FAP, n=8) and from 10 UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MMP-1 and MMP-2 were quantified using sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, northern and western blotting and in situ hybridisation experiments were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> (n=11), MMP-1 and MMP-2 concentrations were increased compared with uninflamed pouches of patients with UC (n=14) or FAP (n=8) (MMP-1 17.7 ng/mg protein v 7.8 (UC) v 7.6 (FAP), p&lt;/=0.05; MMP-2 16.4 v 9.5 (UC) v 6.3 (FAP), p&lt;/=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Western and northern blots revealed increased MMP-1 and MMP-2 protein and transcript concentrations in inflamed pouches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mesenchymal cells were identified as major producers of MMP-1 and MMP-2 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A similar increase in MMPs was observed in tissues of patients with active UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that MMPs are involved in mucosal destruction and crypt <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, as seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
