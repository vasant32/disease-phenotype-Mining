<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The diagnostic significance of increased splanchnic blood flow in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This prospective study was therefore undertaken to define the role of Doppler sonography in the assessment of disease activity and in the prediction of early relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS/METHODS: Splanchnic flowmetry was performed in 76 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (47 with active disease and 29 in remission), six with infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, and 13 healthy controls during fasting and 30 minutes after ingestion of a standardised meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty seven of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> were investigated during the active state as well as in clinical remission and followed up for six months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow velocity and pulsatility index (PI) of the superior (SMA) and inferior (IMA) mesenteric arteries and the portal vein were related to clinical (Truelove index), laboratory (C-reactive protein), and endoscopic (Sutherland index) parameters of disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean flow velocity of the IMA correlated closest with clinical activity (Truelove, r = 0.41, p&lt;0.005), the PI with C-reactive protein (r = 0.30, p&lt;0.05), and endoscopic activity (r = 0.45, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients in remission after six months (14/14) or with infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (6/6) showed an increase in PI of the IMA compared with the initial measurement during active disease (mean increase for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> +36% and for infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> +77%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, most patients with later relapse or surgery (11/13) had decreased PI during initial remission (mean decrease -12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value of this index for maintenance of remission was 0.77 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Flow variables of the SMA and portal vein displayed weaker correlations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Flow measurements in the IMA are closely related to clinical and endoscopic disease activity in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Repeated measurement of the PI allows estimation of the risk of recurrence </plain></SENT>
