<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Immunisation against the mycobacterial heat shock protein (hsp-65) has been proposed to lead to production of autoantibodies against human lactoferrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such antibodies occur in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and in primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study analysed the distribution of hsp-65 and lactoferrin in biopsy specimens from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> and primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> and studied whether immunisation against mycobacterial hsp-65 resulted in production of antilactoferrin antibodies and vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Polyclonal rabbit antihuman lactoferrin and monoclonal mouse anti-hsp-65 (ML30) were used for immunohistochemistry on biopsy specimens from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> and primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were immunised against human lactoferrin and mycobacterial hsp-65 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antibody measurements were done by enzyme immunosorbent assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was found that lactoferrin and hsp-60/65 were not codistributed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lactoferrin was found on vascular endothelium and in nonparenchymal liver cells both in inflamed and uninflamed tissues, but only in the hepatocytes of inflamed liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ML30 reactivity was not inhibited by antilactoferrin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rat anti-hsp-65 serum had no detectable antilactoferrin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, antilactoferrin antibodies probably do not arise by immunisation against mycobacterial hsp-65 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both nonparenchymal cells and hepatocytes probably participate in clearance of lactoferrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Endothelial exposure of lactoferrin may have pathogenic implications in diseases with antilactoferrin autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
