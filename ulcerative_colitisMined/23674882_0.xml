<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The herbal medicine Qing Dai has traditionally been used in Chinese medicine to treat UC patients, but there is a lack of published data on the efficacy of Qing Dai in UC treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report several cases of patients with intractable UC who take Qing Dai in a retrospective observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we explore the mechanisms of action of Qing Dai </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine patients with active UC who received conventional medications but wished to receive Qing Dai as an alternative medication were included in our analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The UC severity level was determined based on the clinical activity index (CAI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, 5 of the 9 patients were endoscopically evaluated according to the Matts grading system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Each patient received 2 g/d of Qing Dai orally and continued taking other medications for UC as prescribed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Electron spin resonance was applied to explore the mechanisms of action of Qing Dai </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 4 mo of treatment with Qing Dai, the CAI score decreased from 8.3 ± 2.4 to 2.4 ± 3.4 (mean ± SD; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the endoscopic Matts grade decreased from 3.4 ± 0.5 to 2.2 ± 0.8 (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six of 7 patients who were on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> upon enrollment in the study were able to discontinue this <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Electron spin resonance revealed that Qing Dai possesses strong <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radical</z:chebi> scavenging activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Qing Dai showed significant clinical and endoscopic efficacy in patients who failed to respond to conventional medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Scavenging of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radicals</z:chebi> appears to be a potential mechanism through which Qing Dai acts, but the significance of the scavenging ability of Qing Dai with respect to the anti-inflammatory effect in UC patients warrants further investigation </plain></SENT>
