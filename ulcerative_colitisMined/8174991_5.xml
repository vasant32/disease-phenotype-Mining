<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examines whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">leukotriene C4</z:chebi> production occurs in apparently unaffected segments of the gut </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intraluminal release of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">leukotriene C4</z:chebi> was determined by jejunal perfusion in seven healthy controls, in nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and in 13 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (six with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ileal disease</z:e>, and seven with only colonic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were in clinical remission and none of them had evidence of jejunal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mild intraluminal irritation with a 2.5 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28834">deoxycholic acid</z:chebi> solution was induced to stimulate local inflammatory mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The release of DNA (a marker of mucosal desquamation) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi>) was simultaneously measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Jejunal release of DNA was higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> or healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Basal release of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> was similar in the three groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Basal release of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">leukotriene C4</z:chebi> was considerably enhanced, however, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients, basal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">leukotriene C4</z:chebi> release was non-significantly different from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">Bile acid</z:chebi> perfusion stimulated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">leukotriene C4</z:chebi>, and DNA release in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups studied, but <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">leukotriene C4</z:chebi> release was significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that in inactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> there is an enhanced intraluminal release of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">leukotriene C4</z:chebi> in apparently unaffected segments of proximal small bowel, which may reflect fundamental changes in the function of the gut mucosal barrier </plain></SENT>
