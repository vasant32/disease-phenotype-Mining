<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To examine an association between the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) gene that plays a role in downregulation of T-cell activation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> consisting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) in the Japanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 108 patients with UC, 79 patients with CD, and 200 sex-matched healthy controls, with respect to three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CTLA4, such as C-318T in the promoter region, A+49G in exon 1 and G+6230A in the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) by a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method, and to an (AT)(n) repeat polymorphism in 3'-UTR by fragment analysis with fluorescence-labeling on denaturing sequence gels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Frequency of alleles and genotypes and their distribution were compared statistically between patients and controls and among subgroups of patients, using chi (2) and Fisher exact tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of "A/A" genotype at the G+6230A SNP site was statistically lower in UC patients than in controls (3.7% vs 11.0%, P = 0.047, odds ratio (OR) = 0.311) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the frequency of "G/G" genotype at the A+49G SNP site was significantly higher in CD patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> (48.6%) than those without it (26.2%) (P = 0.0388, OR=2.67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggest that CTLA4 located at 2q33 is a determinant of UC and responsible for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> formation in CD in the Japanese </plain></SENT>
