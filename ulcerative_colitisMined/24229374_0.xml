<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The primary human colonic epithelial cells were isolated from 19 patients with mild to moderate inflammatory activity of UC and 14 controls using chelation method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cells were cultivated under the effect of mediators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Viability of cells was assessed by fluorescent microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the cells was measured fluorimetrically using Amplex Red </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Production of TNF-α cytokine by the colonic epithelial cells was analysed by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results of our study showed that unstimulated cells of UC patients had a decreased viability, increased ROS production, but similar TNF-α level when compared to the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stimulation with LPS increased <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> and TNF-α level in the UC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment of colonic epithelial cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50423">NADPH oxidase inhibitor</z:chebi> increased cell viability decreased the levels of ROS and TNF-α in the LPS-treated cells isolated from UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> endotoxins induced <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase activation in the colonic epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we revealed that treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50423">NADPH oxidase inhibitors</z:chebi> had a protective effect against pro-inflammatory action of LPS in human colonic epithelium cells during <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
