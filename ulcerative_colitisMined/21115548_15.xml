<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether PTPN2 is also regulated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor α (TNFα) and if PTPN2 controls TNFα-induced signalling and effects in IECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: T₈₄ IECs were used for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Protein levels were assessed by western blotting, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and cytokine levels by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PTPN2 knock-down was induced by small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Imaging was performed by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TNFα treatment elevated PTPN2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> as well as nuclear and cytoplasmic protein levels and caused cytoplasmic accumulation of PTPN2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens from patients with active CD showed strong immunohistochemical PTPN2 staining in the epithelium, whereas samples from patients with CD in remission featured PTPN2 levels similar to controls without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Though samples from patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) revealed more PTPN2 protein than non-IBD patients and patients with UC in remission, their PTPN2 expression was lower than in active CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Samples from patients with CD in remission and responding to anti-TNF treatment also showed PTPN2 levels that were similar to those in control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological inhibition of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) by BMS-345541 prevented the TNFα-induced rise in PTPN2 protein, independent of apoptotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>PTPN2 knock-down revealed that the phosphatase regulates TNFα-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and p38 phosphorylation, without affecting c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), inhibitor of κB (IκB) or NF-κB phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Loss of PTPN2 potentiated TNFα-induced secretion of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In TNFα- and IFNγ-co-treated cells, loss of PTPN2 enhanced protein expression of inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TNFα induces PTPN2 expression in IECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Loss of PTPN2 promotes TNFα-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase signalling and the induction of <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that PTPN2 activity could play a crucial role in the establishment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory conditions in the intestine, such as CD </plain></SENT>
