<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to investigate possible seasonal variations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with symptoms of one year or less were recruited from a prospective study of the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms was recorded month by month for four consecutive years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 420 patients with UC and 142 patients with CD were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was monthly seasonality (p = 0.028) in symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in December and January for UC but not for CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was found that environmental agents with known seasonality can be of importance for the seasonal variations of disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in UC </plain></SENT>
