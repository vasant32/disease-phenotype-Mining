<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The European Crohn's and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>Colitis</z:hpo> Organisation, ECCO, published guidelines in 2009 recommending every patient with IBD be considered for varicella, human <z:mpath ids='MPATH_445'>papilloma</z:mpath> virus, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e>, pneumococcal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B vaccination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examines current immunisation practices in an IBD population at a District General Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 100 consecutive patients with IBD attending general gastroenterology outpatient clinics were asked to complete a questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subtypes of IBD were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Information regarding IBD related medication, recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and immunisation status were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results were analysed using the statistical package for the social sciences, SPSS software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 100 questionnaires were collected; 3 were excluded, 2 due to duplication of patients, 1 was submitted blank </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients' median age was 52 (17-86), with a male to female ratio of 36:64% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of IBD subtypes, 52 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, CD, 42 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, UC, and 3 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> of undetermined type or aetiology, CUTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>91 (94%) of patients had been on prescribed medication for IBD in the last 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of those, a majority (69%) had taken <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi>, nearly half (42%) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi>, a quarter (24%) steroids and 15% anti <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor, anti-TNF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of the 97 patients, 64% had been on an immunosuppressing medication in the previous 6 months, 29% of which reported having had an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in the preceding 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Chest and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>urinary tract infections</z:hpo> were the most commonly reported in 33% and 22% of those reporting an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>39% of patients on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> reported a doctor discussing vaccinations with them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>74% of immunosuppressed patients had received an immunisation of any sort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>92% of these had received <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> vaccine, 40% Pneumovax, 21% <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B vaccination, and 1 (2%) human <z:mpath ids='MPATH_445'>papilloma</z:mpath> virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Of note, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who reported a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149725" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="LRTI">chest infection</z:e> had received the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> vaccine and two thirds had received Pneumovax </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A significant number of patients diagnosed with IBD will require immunosuppressing medications at some point during their care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Despite ECCO guidelines advising <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with IBD be considered for a vaccination program at initial diagnosis, only three quarters had received any vaccinations whatsoever </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in our small cohort, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> and pneumococcal vaccinations did not seem to protect against self reported <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149725" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="LRTI">chest infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Traditionally the role of vaccination has been seen as a function of primary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Increasing awareness of the need for vaccination in primary care may improve adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="?"><plain>Ultimately, with the increasing use of immunomodulators and their inherent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> risks, perhaps more responsibility should be taken on by the IBD clinician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>DISCLOSURE OF INTEREST: None Declared </plain></SENT>
