<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To examine the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17984">acyl-CoA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> profiles in isolated rat colonic epithelial cells treated in vitro with <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="16136">hydrogen sulphide</z:chebi> (NaHS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Isolated rat colonic epithelial cell suspensions were incubated for 10 minutes in the presence of [1-14C] <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">n-butyrate</z:chebi> (5 mM), with and without NaHS (1.5 mM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incubations were carried out both in the presence and the absence of exogenous CoA and ATP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Metabolic performance was assessed by 14CO2 production and by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17984">acyl-CoA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> production measured by HPLC with ultraviolet detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results are given as mean (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For colonocytes incubated in the presence of exogenous CoA and ATP, treatment with NaHS significantly diminished 14CO2 production (control 0.97 (0.06) mumol/g dry weight cells/min, treated 0.26 (0.09) mumol/g dry weight cells/min, p = 0.0019), was associated with an increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15517">butyryl-CoA</z:chebi> concentrations in the final reaction mixture at 10 minutes (control 2.55 (0.28) mumol/g dry weight cells, treated 3.32 (0.32) mumol/g dry weight cells, p = 0.002), and a reduction in crotonyl-CoA concentrations (control 0.274 (0.02) mumol/g dry weight cells, treated 0.120 (0.04) mumol/g dry weight cells, p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15351">acetyl-CoA</z:chebi> in the reaction mixture at 10 minutes was not significantly different between control and <z:chebi fb="35" ids="15138">sulphide</z:chebi> treated incubations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17984">acyl-CoA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> profiles observed when cells were incubated in the absence of exogenous CoA and ATP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results support the view that <z:chebi fb="35" ids="15138">sulphides</z:chebi> inhibit <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">n-butyrate</z:chebi> oxidation in colonic epithelial cells by inhibiting short chain acyl dehydrogenation of activated fatty acids </plain></SENT>
