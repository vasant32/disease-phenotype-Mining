<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous reports have shown that both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> affect people in white collar occupations associated with higher income and higher social class more frequently than other groups in the population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study sought to carry these analyses one step further and investigate the distribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> by individual occupations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The German social security statistics for 'rehabilitation' were used to assess the occupational distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From 1982 to 1988, a total of 12,014 people were granted rehabilitation as a result of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Low male prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> was found among bricklayers, road construction workers, unskilled workers in brick and stone, unskilled labourers, and security personnel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Low rates were found among women employed in cleaning and maintenance, and in those without occupation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a high male prevalence was found among instrument makers, electricians, bakers, and technical assistants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among female employees, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> was significantly associated with sales representatives, office workers, health occupations, and hairdressers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These associations were found in the complete data for 1982-8 as well as in the separate data for the two half periods 1982-5 and 1986-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Highly significant correlations between the occupational distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> were found among both male and female employees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It seems that occupations involving work in the open air and physical exercise are protective, while being exposed to air conditioned artificial working conditions or extended and irregular shift working confer a risk of contracting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
