<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To describe the effect of Rheum tanguticum <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18154">polysaccharide</z:chebi> (RTP) on <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi>-induced human intestinal epithelial cell injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">Hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> (100 micromol/L) was introduced to induce human intestinal epithelial cell injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cells were pretreated with RTP (30,100,300 microg/mL) for 24 h before exposure to <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell viability was detected by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay and morphological observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="51739">Acridine orange</z:chebi> staining and flow cytometry were performed to assess cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">Lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, production of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) activity were measured by spectrophotometry with corresponding assay kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Following exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>, a marked decrease in cell survival and SOD activity, increased production of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>, LDH leakage and cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of the cells with RTP could significantly elevate cell survival, SOD activity and decrease the level of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>, LDH activity and cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: RTP may have cytoprotective and anti-oxidant effects against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>-induced intestinal epithelial cell injury by inhibiting cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This might be one of the possible mechanisms of RTP for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
