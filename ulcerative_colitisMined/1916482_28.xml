<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Since <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> predominantly affects non-smokers and ex-smokers we have examined the possibility that smoking modifies the humoral immune response to an antigenic challenge from the gut lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gut lavage was used in healthy subjects and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, including both smokers and non-smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antibodies in the intestinal fluid to Escherichia coli (five pooled serotypes), Candida albicans, gliadin, ovalbumin, and beta lactoglobulin were measured by ELISA to determine specific antibody concentrations of IgG, IgA, and IgM classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total IgG, IgA, and IgM were also measured in intestinal secretions and serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, circulating antibody concentrations of IgG, IgA, and IgM to three gut commensals - E coli (five pooled serotypes) C albicans, and Poroteus mirabilis were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant reduction in the IgA concentration in intestinal fluid of smokers with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> compared with healthy non-smoking controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No other significant differences were found between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, these data are not consistent with the idea that smoking suppresses immune responses in the gut and suggest that the effect of smoking in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> is mediated by another mechanism </plain></SENT>
