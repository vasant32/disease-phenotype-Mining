<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Traditionally, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> has been associated with a Th1 cytokine profile, while Th2 cytokines are modulators of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This concept has been challenged by the description of tolerising regulatory T cells (Treg) and by proinflammatory Th17 cells, a novel T cell population characterised by the master transcription factor RORgammat, the surface markers IL23R and CCR6, and by production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL17A, IL17F, IL21, IL22 and IL26, and the chemokine CCL20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Th17 cells differentiate under the influence of IL1beta, IL6, IL21 and IL23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent studies indicate that TGFbeta is essential not only for the development of murine Th17 cells but also for differentiation of human Th17 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TGFbeta reciprocally regulates the differentiation of inflammatory Th17 cells and suppressive Treg subsets, with the concomitant presence of proinflammatory cytokines favouring Th17 cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several studies demonstrated an important role of Th17 cells in <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp>, particularly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide association studies indicate that IL23R and five additional genes involved in Th17 differentiation (IL12B, JAK2, STAT3, CCR6 and TNFSF15) are associated with susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and partly also to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, both Th1 and Th17 cells are important mediators of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, although activities previously ascribed to IL12 may be mediated by IL23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anti-IL12/IL23p40 antibody therapy, which targets both Th1 and Th17 cells, is effective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the complex relationship between Th1 and Th17 cells has not been completely analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This will be of great importance to delineate the specific contributions of these cells to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
