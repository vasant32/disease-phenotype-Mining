<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to explore the 1 year outcome in an inception cohort of paediatric UC patients and to identify early predictors of good outcome that might serve as short term treatment targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A chart review of 115 children with new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> UC was performed (age 11±4.1 years; 58 (50%) males; 86 (75%) extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>; 70 (61%) moderate-severe disease; 63 (55%) received steroids at baseline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed the Paediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative Colitis</z:hpo> Activity Index (PUCAI) and laboratory variables at the time of diagnosis and at 3 months, and endoscopy at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 3 month PUCAI was the strongest predictor of 1 year sustained steroid free remission (SSFR) (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)=0.7 (95% CI 0.6 to 0.8) and colectomy by 2 years (AUROC=0.75 (0.6 to 0.89)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SSFR was achieved in 9/54 (17%) children who had active disease (PUCAI ≥10) at 3 months (negative predictive value (NPV)=83%) and by 4/46 (8.6%) of those with a PUCAI score &gt;10; (NPV=91%, positive predictive value=52%; p&lt;0.001), implying that PUCAI &gt;10 at 3 months has a probability of 9% for achieving SSFR versus 48% with a PUCAI value of ≤10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the variables at baseline was predictive of SSFR or colectomy (endoscopic severity, disease extent, age, PUCAI or C reactive protein/erythrocyte sedimentation rate/albumin/<z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> AUROC&lt;0.6, p&gt;0.05) but baseline PUCAI predicted subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and the need for salvage medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Completeness of the early response appears more important than baseline UC severity for predicting outcome in children, and supports using PUCAI&lt;10 as a feasible treatment goal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that treatment escalation should be considered with a PUCAI value of ≥10 at 3 months </plain></SENT>
