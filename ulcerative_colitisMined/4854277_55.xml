<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An analysis is presented of the course and outcome of the initial referred attack in a group of 332 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> treated at the General Infirmary at Leeds from 1939 to 1968 inclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A further 50 cases were excluded on the basis of insufficient diagnostic evidence: usually such patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> terminal <z:mp ids='MP_0009482'>ileitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only 5% of patients achieved full remission on conservative management, and most eventually came to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall fatality rate was some 3.3% and this was affected chiefly by the severity of attack and the age of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The severity of attack was classified as mild, moderate, or severe according to a system which took into account factors such as bowel habit, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, pulse rate, temperature, <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi>, and weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In attacks graded as ;mild', no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred; in those graded ;severe' the fatality rate was 8.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, whilst no patient under 20 years of age died, the fatality rate in the over 60s was some 14.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further comparison between the present group of 332 patients and an earlier series of 204 patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (Watts, de Dombal, Watkinson, and Goligher, 1966a) shows considerable differences in the course and prognosis of the two diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In particular 70% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> achieved remission on conservative management alone whereas only 5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients did so </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These differences, and in particular the poor response to conservative therapy, are discussed, together with their implications for management </plain></SENT>
