<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite the growing use of medical salvage therapy, colectomy has remained a cornerstone in managing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (ASC) both in children and in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Colectomy should be regarded as a life saving procedure in ASC, and must be seriously considered in any steroid-refractory patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, colectomy is not a cure for the disease but rather the substitution of a large problem with smaller problems, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002607'>fecal incontinence</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e>, irritable pouch syndrome, cuffitis, anastomotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> and stenosis, missed or de-novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and, in young females, reduced fecundity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This notion has led to the widespread practice of offering medical salvage therapy before colectomy in most patients without surgical abdomen or toxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002251'>megacolon</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Medical salvage therapies which have proved effective in the clinical trial setting include <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>, tacrolimus and infliximab, which seem equally effective in the short term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Validated predictive rules can identify a subset of patients who will eventually fail <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy after only 3-5 d of steroid therapy with an accuracy of 85%-95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This accuracy is sufficiently high for initiating medical therapy, but usually not colectomy, early in the admission without delaying colectomy if required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This approach has reduced the colectomy rate in ASC from 30%-70% in the past to 10%-20% nowadays, and the mortality rate from over 70% in the 1930s to about 1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In general, restorative proctocolectomy (ileoanal pouch or ileal pouch-anal anastomosis), especially the J-pouch, is preferred over straight pull-through (ileo-anal) or ileo-rectal anastomosis, which may still be considered in young females concerned about <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Colectomy in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> setting, is usually performed in three steps due to the severity of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, concurrent steroid treatment and the generally reduced clinical condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The first surgical step involves colectomy and constructing an ileal stoma, the second - constructing the pouch and the third - closing the stoma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This review focuses on the role of surgical treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in the era of medical rescue therapy </plain></SENT>
