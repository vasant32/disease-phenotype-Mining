<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To examine the relation between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> and appendicectomy, childhood domestic hygiene, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Case control study involving 213 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, 110 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, and 337 controls having elective surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (4.5%) reported a previous appendicectomy compared with 57 controls (19%) (odds ratio (OR) 0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>1-0.4, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inverse association was unaffected by excluding operations performed after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and was stronger for appendicectomy performed before age 20 (OR 0.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No association with appendicectomy was found for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and no associations with tonsillectomy for either disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The availability of a fixed hot water supply in early childhood (before age 11) was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (OR for hot water not always versus always available 0.56, 95% CI 0.3-0.9, p=0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>02) but not with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No other aspect of domestic hygiene before or after age 11 was associated with either <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although H pylori seroprevalence was positively associated with overcrowding (p&lt;0.001) and the absence of running hot water in childhood it was not associated with the presence of either <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>H pylori seroprevalence was no lower in patients who had been exposed to sulphasalazine than in controls or those not exposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm the strong inverse association between previous appendicectomy and the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and suggest that the protective effect is greater for appendicectomy performed in childhood </plain></SENT>
