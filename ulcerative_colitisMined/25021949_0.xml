<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: We developed a Markov model for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> that calculated the costs of two different treatment strategies for 1000 patients and healthcare providers and ran the model over a ten year cycle to evaluate each treatment arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Healthcare costs were calculated from the published study of costs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> at Aintree University Hospital, Liverpool, UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Effects were quantified with the EQ-5D visual analogue scale and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lost income for patients was calculated assuming that the patient was self employed, earning the national average wage and had no sickness benefits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cohort simulation is used to present the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the end of exercise, 277 patients were in the phase of remission in <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> continuing arm and 232 patients were in the same phase in <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> discontinuing arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total costs to the healthcare providers for providing treatment to the patients were found to be £15,390,139.81 (discounted-£12,825,018.45) for <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> continuing arm and that for <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> discontinuing arm were £12,911,557.43 (discounted-£10,752,633.35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These costs were incurred to gain QALYs of 31,682.14 (discounted-26713.79) for the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> continuing arm and of 31,307.73 (discounted-26,405.89 for <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> discontinuing arm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome in terms of ICER (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio) is £6730.55 per QALY (acceptable range &lt;£20,000-30,000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes such as Discounted total earnings lost due to illness and Discounted total earnings affected due to work impairment were found to be in favour of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> continuation by 19.43% (£3.7 million) and 11.15% (£7.8 million) in favour of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> continuing arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analysis was conducted to challenge both the cost and effect assumptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CEAC (Cost Effectiveness Acceptability Curve) revealed the probability of 1 is reached with the cost-effectiveness acceptability limit of £40,000 ceiling limit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Markov models have been used extensively to study the cost-effectiveness of healthcare interventions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our Markov model considered costs for both patients and healthcare providers, rather than solely considering the costs for healthcare providers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Results not only revealed the cost-effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> for the healthcare provider but also potential benefits for the broader economy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>DISCLOSURE OF INTEREST: None Declared </plain></SENT>
