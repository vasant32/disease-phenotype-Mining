<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Colonic mucosa of collagenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> is known to be endoscopically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present a case of collagenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> where the mucosa showed diffuse cloudiness mimicking <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 70-year-old woman developed watery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> four to nine times a day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She had interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> at 67 and reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> at 70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">Lansoprazole</z:chebi> 30 mg/d had been prescribed for reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> for nearly 6 mo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">Lansoprazole</z:chebi> was withdrawn due to its possible side effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy disclosed diffuse cloudiness of the mucosa which suggested <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consequently <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">sulfasalazine</z:chebi> 2 g/d was started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> dramatically disappeared on the following day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, biopsy specimens showed subepithelial collagenous thickening and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lamina propria, confirming the diagnosis of collagenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One month after <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">sulfasalazine</z:chebi> therapy was initiated, colonoscopic and histological abnormalities resolved completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Five months later the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> recurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The findings on colonoscopy and histology were the same as before, confirming a diagnosis of collagenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We found that the patient had begun to take <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi> again 3 mo ahead of the recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Withdrawal of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi> promptly resolved the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
