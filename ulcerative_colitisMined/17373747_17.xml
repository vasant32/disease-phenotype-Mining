<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and mechanism of action of NCB 02, a standardized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">Curcumin</z:chebi> preparation, against 2, 4 dinitrochlorobenzene (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34718">DNCB</z:chebi>) induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> was induced in male rats by sensitizing with topical application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34718">DNCB</z:chebi> in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="15347">acetone</z:chebi> for 14 d and intra-colonol challenge with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34718">DNCB</z:chebi> on day 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A separate group of animals with vehicle treatment in similar fashion served as control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>Colitis</z:hpo> rats were divided into different groups and treated with NCB-02 at doses of 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg b.wt p.o. for 10 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">Sulfasalazine</z:chebi> at a dose of 100 mg/kg b.wt for 10 d served as a reference group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On day 10 after respective assigned treatment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the animals were euthanized and the length of the colon, weight of entire colon and distal 8 cm of the colon were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distal part of the colon was immediately observed under a stereomicroscope and the degree of damage was scored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further distal 8 cm of the colon was subject to the determination of colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO), <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation (LPO) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A small piece of the sample from distal colon of each animal was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin wax and sectioned for immunohistochemical examination of NFkappa-B and iNOS expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NCB-02 showed a dose dependent protection against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34718">DNCB</z:chebi>-induced alteration in colon length and weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NCB-02 treatment also showed a dose dependent protection against the elevated levels of MPO, LPO and ALP, induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34718">DNCB</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>NCB-02 demonstrated a significant effect at a dose of 100 mg/kg b.wt., which was almost equipotent to 100 mg/kg b.wt. of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">sulfasalazine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">sulfasalazine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> at a dose of 100 mg/kg b.wt. inhibited the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34718">DNCB</z:chebi>-induced overexpression of NFkappa-B and iNOS in the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">Curcumin</z:chebi> treatment ameliorates colonic damage in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34718">DNCB</z:chebi> induced colitic rats, an effect associated with an improvement in intestinal <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and downregulation of colonic NFkappa-B and iNOS expression </plain></SENT>
