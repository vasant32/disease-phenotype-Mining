<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The exact etiology and pathology of IBD remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Available evidence suggests that an abnormal immune response against the microorganisms in the intestine is responsible for the disease in genetically susceptible individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dysregulation of immune response in the intestine plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of IBD, involving a wide range of molecules including cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, besides T helper (Th) 1 and Th2 cell immune responses, other subsets of T cells, namely Th17 and regulatory T cells, are likely associated with disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Studying the interactions between various constituents of the innate and adaptive immune systems will certainly open new horizons of the knowledge about the immunologic mechanisms in IBD </plain></SENT>
