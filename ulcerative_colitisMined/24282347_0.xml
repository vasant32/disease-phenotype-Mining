<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The exact causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) are not yet fully defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From a vast body of literature, we know that the immune response has long been involved in the pathogenesis of IBD, including both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A variety of specific alterations can lead to immune activation and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> directed to the colon, as revealed by some animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Current research has focused on the role of antibodies in downstream events and mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is not well known whether the production of antibodies is a serologic consequence of IBD, or if it is a result of barrier dysfunction induced by <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we present a new hypothesis to distinguish the complex links between genetic susceptibility, barrier dysfunction, commensal and pathologic microbial factors and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> (especially autoantibodies) in the pathogenesis of IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To ascertain the hypothesis, we developed a pilot model with the concept of the presence of antibodies against enteric <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> antigens in IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results confirmed our hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our hypothesis suggests the possibility of subcutaneous vaccination of animals with administration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> or specific enteric <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> antigens </plain></SENT>
