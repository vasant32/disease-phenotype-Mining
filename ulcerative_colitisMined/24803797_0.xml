<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) may have an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (VTE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge and Scopus were searched to identify studies investigating the risk of VTE and the prevalence of acquired and genetic VTE risk factors and prothrombotic abnormalities in IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall, IBD patients have a two- to fourfold increased risk of VTE compared with healthy controls, with an overall incidence rate of 1%-8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority of studies did not show significant differences in the risk of VTE between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several acquired factors are responsible for the increased risk of VTE in IBD: inflammatory activity, hospitalisation, surgery, pregnancy, disease phenotype (e.g., fistulising <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disease, colonic</z:e> involvement and extensive involvement) and drug therapy (mainly steroids) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is also convincing evidence from basic science and from clinical and epidemiological studies that IBD is associated with several prothrombotic abnormalities, including initiation of the coagulation system, downregulation of natural <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> mechanisms, impairment of fibrinolysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>increased platelet count</z:hpo> and reactivity and dysfunction of the endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Classical genetic alterations are not generally found more often in IBD patients than in non-IBD patients, suggesting that genetics does not explain the greater risk of VTE in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IBD VTE may have clinical specificities, namely an earlier first episode of VTE in life, high recurrence rate, decreased efficacy of some drugs in preventing further episodes and poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinicians should be aware of these risks, and adequate prophylactic actions should be taken in patients who have disease activity, are hospitalised, are submitted to surgery or are undergoing treatment </plain></SENT>
