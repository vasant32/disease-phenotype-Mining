<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study a synthetic dodecapeptide from the corresponding <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> (Ad12E1b, residues 384-395) was tested for its effect on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 22 treated and eight untreated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coeliac disease</z:e>, 22 healthy subjects, 11 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and 11 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> by an indirect leucocyte migration inhibition assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the effect of both the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> and the gliadin synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> was studied by proliferation and migration assays simultaneously performed in an unselected subgroup of 12 treated coeliac patients and 12 healthy subjects of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coeliac patients with untreated disease showed no response to the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> compared with treated patients (p greater than 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treated coeliac patients showed a significantly different response from healthy control subjects and control patients with disease (p less than 0.001) which was dependent on the concentration of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup of the treated coeliac patients (n = 12) there was a significant correlation between the responses in the migration and the proliferation assay using either the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> (p less than 0.02) or the gliadin (p less than 0.005) <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> at the highest concentration (33.3 micrograms/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the responses obtained using <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> correlated significantly with the responses obtained with gliadin <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> in both the migration (p less than 0.001) and the proliferation (p less than 0.001) assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results show that in coeliac patients there is pronounced cross reactivity at the level of T cell recognition between synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> derived from the Ad12 and A-gliadin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This antigenic cross reactivity may be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coeliac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
