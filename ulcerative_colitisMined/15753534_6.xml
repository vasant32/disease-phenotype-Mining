<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) is characterised by refractory inflammatory ulceration and damage to the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms underlying impaired healing have yet to be defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As transglutaminase expression resulting in matrix protein cross linking is associated with increased wound healing in a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, we hypothesised that different types of transglutaminase might also play a role in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Endoscopic and histological indices were studied in 26 patients with UC (10 active and 16 inactive) and in 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls undergoing colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transglutaminase activity was evaluated in plasma (factor XIIIa) by a radioenzymatic method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Factor XIIIa, tissue and keratinocyte transglutaminase protein content, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in the colon were evaluated by western blot analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Colonic location of transglutaminases and their reaction products, the epsilon-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24190">gamma-glutamyl</z:chebi>)lysine bonds, was evaluated by immunohistochemistry using specific monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Transglutaminase activity was significantly lower in the plasma of patients with active UC (4.2 (2.4) mU/ml; p&lt;0.05 v controls) than in those with inactive UC and controls (10.6 (2.2) and 12.1 (1.7) mU/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As shown by western blot, protein levels of tissue transglutaminase and factor XIIIa were unchanged in active UC compared with inactive disease and controls, while the keratinocyte form was reduced in active UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Tissue transglutaminase and factor XIIIa immunostaining was strongly present in damaged areas colocalising with isopeptide bonds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the keratinocyte form was almost absent in active UC and localised in the upper part of the crypts in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR showed upregulation of tissue transglutaminase <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in active UC (320% compared with controls) while keratinocyte transglutaminase gene expression was downregulated in active UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study support the concept that, in the damaged colon, transglutaminases are needed in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> injury and underline the key role of these enzymes in mucosal healing </plain></SENT>
