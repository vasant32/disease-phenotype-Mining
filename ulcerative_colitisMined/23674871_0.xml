<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the expression of interleukin (IL)-22 and its related proteins in biopsy specimens from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and UC-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Biopsy specimens were obtained from patients with inactive (n = 10), mild-to-moderately active (n = 30), severely active (n = 34), initial (n = 30), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> UC (n = 44), as well as UC patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specimens from patients without colonic abnormalities (n = 20) served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100281'>Chronic colitis</z:hpo> in experimental mice was induced by 2.5% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32149">sodium sulfate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of IL-22, IL-23, IL-22R1 and phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) were determined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2, cyclin D1 and survivin expression was detected by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with active UC had significantly more IL-22, IL-23, IL-22R1 and p-STAT3-positive cells than the patients with inactive UC and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, IL-22 and related proteins were closely related to the severity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of IL-22 and IL-22R1 in the tissue of initial UC was stronger than in that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> UC, whereas the expression of p-STAT3 was significantly increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> UC tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> tissues, the expression level of IL-22 and related proteins was higher compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> model showed that expression of IL-22, IL-22R1 and IL-23 was increased with time, p-STAT3 and the downstream gene were also remarkably upregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IL-22/STAT3 signaling pathway may be related to UC and UC-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and IL-22 can be used as a biomarker in judging the severity of UC </plain></SENT>
