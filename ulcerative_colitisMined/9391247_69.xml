<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is well established that glutamine supplemented elemental diets result in less severe intestinal damage in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few studies have examined the mode of action of glutamine in reducing intestinal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To examine the effects of glutamine supplemented elemental diets on the potent inflammatory cytokines interleukin 8 (IL-8) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48110">trinitrobenzene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29214">sulphonic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi>) induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> which presents with both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomised into three dietary groups and fed 20% casein (controls), or 20% casein supplemented with either 2% glutamine (2% Gln) or 4% glutamine (4% Gln) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After two weeks they received intracolonic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi> to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both Gln groups of rats gained more weight than the control group (p &lt; 0.05) which had progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Colon weight, macroscopic, and microscopic damage scores for the Gln groups were lower than in the control group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IL-8 and TNF-alpha concentrations in inflamed colonic tissues were lower in the Gln groups than in the control group (p &lt; 0.05), and correlated well with disease severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>Bacterial</z:mp> translocation was lower both in incidence (p &lt; 0.05) and in the number of colony forming units (p &lt; 0.05) for the Gln groups, than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With respect to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> indices studied, the 4% Gln group performed better than did the 2% Gln group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Prophylactic glutamine supplementation modulates the inflammatory activities of IL-8 and TNF-alpha in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi> induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
