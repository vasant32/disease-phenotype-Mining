<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> disease activity indices offer good statistical power but small changes in these indices may not be clinically important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are no validated definitions of remission or of significant improvement for these indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The use of clinically important end points would strengthen the validity of study outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aims were to identify objective end points in standard disease activity indices for remission and for improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty six consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> provided information about remission status and their disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At a return visit 1-14 months later, these patients provided information about the change in their disease activity, and non-invasive indices were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Specific objective end points for determining remission with four standard indices and a quality of life instrument were determined (St Mark's &lt;3.5, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> disease activity index &lt;2.5, simple clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> activity index (SCCAI) &lt;2.5, Seo &lt;120, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> quality of life index (IBDQ) &gt;205) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These cut offs also identified patients who met a regulatory definition of remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Specific objective end points for clinical improvement in two non-invasive indices and a quality of life instrument were determined with good sensitivity and specificity (SCCAI decrease &gt;1.5, Seo decrease &gt;30, IBDQ increase &gt;20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found specific cut off values for disease activity indices that identify patients who have significantly improved or achieved remission in an objective, sensitive, and specific manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These cut offs should help in the interpretation of the outcomes of clinical trials in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
