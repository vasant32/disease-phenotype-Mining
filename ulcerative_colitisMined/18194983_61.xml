<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were (1) to investigate the origin of this elevated serine protease activity, (2) to evaluate if it may be sufficient to trigger alterations in colonic paracellular permeability (CPP) and sensitivity, and (3) to examine the role of the proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) activation and signalling cascade in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Faecal enzymatic activities were assayed in healthy subjects and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013369" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious diarrhoea</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following mucosal exposure to supernatants from control subjects and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>-D patients, electromyographic response to colorectal balloon distension was recorded in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and PAR-2(-/-) mice, and CPP was evaluated on colonic strips in Ussing chambers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and phosphorylated myosin light chain were detected by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The threefold increase in faecal serine protease activity seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>-D patients compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo>-predominant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>-C) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013369" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious diarrhoea</z:e> is of neither epithelial nor inflammatory cell origin, nor is it coupled with antiprotease activity of endogenous origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mucosal application of faecal supernatants from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>-D patients in mice evoked <z:mp ids='MP_0003177'>allodynia</z:mp> and increased CPP by 92%, both of which effects were prevented by serine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitors</z:chebi> and dependent on PAR-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In mice, colonic exposure to supernatants from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>-D patients resulted in a rapid increase in the phosphorylation of myosin light chain and delayed redistribution of ZO-1 in colonocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated colonic lumenal serine protease activity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>-D patients evokes a PAR-2-mediated colonic epithelial barrier dysfunction and subsequent <z:mp ids='MP_0003177'>allodynia</z:mp> in mice, suggesting a novel organic background in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
