<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To investigate whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> levels are associated with Heat Shock Protein 70 (HSP70) induction in the colon of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The design was cross-sectional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical activity was assessed by the Rachmilewitz Index (CAI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three psychometric questionnaires were used: Zung <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Rating Scale (ZDRS), Spielberg State-Trait <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> Inventory (STAI), Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale (HADS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colon biopsies were obtained from each affected anatomical site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was assessed by eosin/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Constitutive (HSP70c) and inducible (HSP70i) HSP70 expression were immunohistochemically studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 29 UC patients were enrolled (69% men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 46.5 years (SD: 19.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammation</z:mp> severity was moderate in 17 patients, severe in 6, and mild in 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean number of years since diagnosis was 7.9 (SD: 6.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean CAI was 6.4 (SD: 3.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In active UC, there was downregulation of HSP70c in inflamed epithelium, without significant HSP70 induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In 22/29 cases of active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1394254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cryptitis</z:e>, polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) clearly expressed HSP70i, with weak, focal positivity in the other 7 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Except for the hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> scale, scores in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> psychometric tools were higher in patients with strong HSP70i immunoreactivity in the PMN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression showed a strong positive relationship between HSP70i immunoreactivity in the PMN cells and scores in the trait <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, ZDRS, and hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scales, (Odds ratios 1.3, 1.3, and 1.5; P = 0.018, 0.023, and 0.038; Wald test, 5.6, 5.2, and 4.3 respectively) and a weaker but significant positive correlation with the CAI (Odds ratio 1.654; P = 0.049; Wald test 3.858) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HSP70 is induced in PMN cells of UC patients and its induction correlates with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> levels </plain></SENT>
