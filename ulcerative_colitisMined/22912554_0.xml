<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 28 patients with pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> UC underwent ileal pouch biopsy 13 years (median) after proctocolectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression of MMPs-3, -7, -8, -9, -12 and -26 and TIMPs-1, -2 and -3 in samples was examined using immunohistochemichal methods, and another biopsy was used to evaluate the grade of histological <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two investigators independently graded the immunohistochemical specimens in a semiquantitative fashion, using a scale marking staining intensity as follows: 0 = less than 20 positive cells; 1 = 20-50 positive cells; 2 = 50-200 positive cells; 3 = over 20 positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fecal calprotectin and blood inflammatory markers [serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate] were determined during a follow-up visit to examine correlations between these markers and the expression of MMPs and TIMPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 28 patients with pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> UC, nine had not experienced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e>, whereas thirteen reported a single episode, and six had recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> (≥ 4 episodes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the time of the study, six patients required <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6909">metronidazole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the others, the most recent episode of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> had occurred over one month earlier, and none were on antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only four samples depicted no sign of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and these were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> from patients who had not had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two samples were too small to determine the grade of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, but both had suffered <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e>, the other recurrent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No sample depicted signs of colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most pouch samples showed expression of epithelial (e) and stromal (s) MMP-3 (e, n = 22; s, n = 20), MMP-7 (e, n = 28; s, n = 27), MMP-12 (e, n = 20; s, n =24), TIMP-2 (e, n = 23; s, n = 23) and MMP-3 (e, n = 23; s, n = 28) but MMP-8 (e, n = 0; s, n = 1), MMP-9 (e, n = 0; s, n = 9) and MMP-26 (e, n = 0; s, n = 3) and TIMP-1 (n = 0, both) were lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In samples with low grade of inflammatory activity, the epithelial MMP-3 and MMP-7 expression was increased (r = -0.614 and r = -0.472, respectively, P &lt; 0.05 in both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>MMPs and TIMPs did not correlate with the markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, fecal calprotectin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or CRP, with the exception of patients with low fecal calprotectin (&lt; 100 μg/g) in whom a higher expression of epithelial MMP-7 was found no differences in MMP- or TIMP-profiles were seen in patients with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> compared to ones with no such episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Anastomosis with either straight ileoanal anastomosis or ileoanal anastomosis with J-pouch did depict differences in MMP- or TIMP-expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The expression of MMPs pediatric UC pouch in the long-term shares characteristics with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, but <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> cannot be classified as a reactivation of the disease </plain></SENT>
