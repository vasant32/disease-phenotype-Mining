<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to elucidate the immuno-imbalances in the appendix of UC patients, and to clarify the role of the appendix in the development of UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Colonoscopic biopsy specimens of the appendix, transverse colon, and rectum were obtained from 86 patients with UC: active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0868908" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pancolitis</z:e> (A-Pan; n = 15), active left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (A-Lt; n = 25), A-Lt with appendiceal involvement (A-Lt/Ap; n = 10), inactive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0868908" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pancolitis</z:e> (I-Pan; n = 14), and inactive left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (I-Lt; n = 22), and from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the isolated mucosal T cells, the CD4/CD8 ratio and proportion of activated CD4+ T cells were investigated, and compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the appendix, the CD4/CD8 ratio significantly increased in A-Lt and A-Lt/Ap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ratio in the appendix also tended to increase in A-Pan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the rectum, the ratio significantly increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> UC groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the appendix, the proportion of CD4+CD69+ (early activation antigen) T cells significantly increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> UC groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the rectum, the proportion of CD4+CD69+ T cells significantly increased only in A-Pan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The proportion of CD4+HLA-DR+ (mature activation antigen) T cells significantly increased only in the rectum of A-Pan, but not in the other areas of any groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The increased CD4/CD8 ratio and predominant infiltration of CD4+CD69+ T cells in the appendix suggest that the appendix is a priming site in the development of UC </plain></SENT>
