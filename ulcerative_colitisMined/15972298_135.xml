<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There are limited evidence based data concerning the use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to compare the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> and oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi> in inducing remission of steroid dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy two patients with steroid dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> were admitted to this investigator-blind study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Steroid dependence was defined as a requirement for steroid therapy &gt; or =10 mg/day during the preceding six months, with at least two attempts to discontinue the medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The disease had to be clinically and endoscopically active at study entry, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were taking systemic <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> (40 mg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomised to receive <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> 2 mg/kg/day or oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi> 3.2 g/day, for a six month follow up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The outcome of the treatment was defined as (1) success, indicating induction of clinical and endoscopic remission and steroid discontinuation, or (2) failure, indicating the absence of clinical and endoscopic remission and therefore the need for at least one further cycle of systemic steroids to control symptoms, apart from the initial one, or colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significantly more patients in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> than in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi> group had clinical and endoscopic remission, and discontinued steroid therapy, both in the intention to treat (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> v <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi>: 19/36 patients (53%) v 7/36 (21%); odds ratio (OR) 4.78 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.57-14.5)) and per protocol (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> v <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi>: 19/33 patients (58%) v 7/34 (21%); OR 5.26 (95% CI 1.59-18.1)) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">Azathioprine</z:chebi> is significantly more effective than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi> in inducing clinical and endoscopic remission and avoiding steroid requirement in the treatment of steroid dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
