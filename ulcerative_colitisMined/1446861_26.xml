<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The influence of the disease activity on fatty acid profile was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma fatty acid patterns in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma C18:3n3 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30081">C22</z:chebi>:6n3 were significantly higher in active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (p = 0.0143 and p &lt; 0.00001 respectively) and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.00001 for both) than in controls, whereas C20:3n6 was significantly lower in patients than in controls, both in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (p = 0.0001) and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (p = 0.0041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In more severe disease, plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acid</z:chebi> concentrations fell with a significant stepwise decrease in the desaturation index (p = 0.0031 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and p = 0.0355 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Even in patients with severe disease, however, plasma n3 fatty acids (C18:3n3 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30081">C22</z:chebi>:6n3) never fell below those of healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that in active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, an increased biosynthesis might coexist with an increased consumption of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations may be of relevance in the pathogenesis of the disease as <z:chebi fb="7" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi> are involved in tissue eicosanoid synthesis and cellular membrane function, including that of immunocompetent cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results also question the rationale of using n3 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi> in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
