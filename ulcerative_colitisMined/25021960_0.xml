<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> (TNF)-alpha monoclonal antibody infliximab is more effective in the treatment of CD than UC but its mechanism of action is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore evaluated the effect of infliximab on the expression of a panel of phospho-proteins by inflamed CD and UC colonic biopsies cultured ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Colonic biopsies were obtained from macroscopically inflamed areas of 5 patients with CD and 2 patients with UC, and were then cultured for 24 h in 300ul of serum-free <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-1 medium with infliximab (5ug/ml), or control IgG1 (5ug/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The biopsies were then snap frozen and later lysed to extract the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A Path Scan RTK signalling array kit from New England Biolabs was used to measure the expression of a panel of 39 phosphorylated proteins in the biopsy homogenates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Infliximab significantly reduced the expression of phosphorylated ALK, FLT3, EphB3,p44/42 MAPK, S6 Ribosomal Protein and Stat1 by over 40 fold compared to IgG1 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> biopsies cultured ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In UC biopsies infliximab did not induce any significant change in phosphoprotein expression compared to IgG1 control except for a 10 fold reduction in phospho-VEGFR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Infliximab reduces the expression phospho-proteins Stat 1, ALK and p44/42 MAPK, which have a central role in sustaining the pro-inflammatory immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Differences in the effect of infliximab on the phosphorylation status of mucosal proteins may account for its different efficacy profile in CD and UC </plain></SENT>
