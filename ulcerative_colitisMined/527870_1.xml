<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both the fractional catabolic rate and the synthesis rate of Clq were increased in the five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and in four of the five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The fifth patient was in remission and had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> synthesis rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results support the hypothesis that complement activation plays a role in the pathogenesis of these <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> and that the increased complement activation is primarily via the classical pathway </plain></SENT>
