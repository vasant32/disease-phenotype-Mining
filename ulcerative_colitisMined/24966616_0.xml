<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty UC specimens taken by colonoscopy from patients with active UC treated at the Department of Pathology, Central Hospital Affiliated to Shenyang Medical College from February 2010 to January 2012 were included in an experimental group, and 30 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon tissue samples taken by colonoscopy from non-UC patients were included in a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression of TF and TFPI in UC and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon tissue samples was detected by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The positive rate of TF in UC was significantly higher than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon tissue (63% vs 33%, χ (2) = 5.41, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The positive rate of TFPI in UC was also significantly higher than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon tissue (43% vs 17%, χ (2) = 5.08, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Positive rates of TF and TFPI expression in UC are significantly higher than those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TF and TFPI may play an important role in the pathogenesis of UC </plain></SENT>
