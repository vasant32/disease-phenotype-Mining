<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Human OneArray microarrays were used for a complete genome-wide transcript profiling of PBMCs from 12 UC patients and 6 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Differential analysis per gene was performed with a random variance model; t test and P values were adjusted to control the false discovery rate (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gene ontology (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e>) was deployed to analyze differentially expressed genes at significant levels between patients and controls to identify the biological processes involved in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Comparative analysis revealed that 4438 probes (4188 genes) were differentially expressed between the two groups, of which 3689 probes (3590 genes) were down-regulated whereas 749 probes (598 genes) were up-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many disregulated genes in our data have been reported by previous microarray studies carried out on intestinal mucosa samples, such as S100A8, CEACAM1 and S100A9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> enrichment analysis revealed 67 high enrichment up-regulated categories and one significant down-regulated category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The up-regulated genes were mainly involved in immune and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp>, cell cycle and proliferation, DNA metabolism and repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Gene expression profiling of PBMCs from patients with UC has highlighted several novel gene categories that could contribute to the pathogenesis of UC </plain></SENT>
