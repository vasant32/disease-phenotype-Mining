<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anti-goblet cell antibody in the serum was examined by immunocytochemistry and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> cell line, HT29-18<z:chebi fb="31" ids="30226">-N2</z:chebi>, which differentiates into intestinal goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of anti-goblet cell antibody detected by immunocytochemistry were 14 in 48 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (29%) and five in 15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By ELISA, the frequencies of anti-goblet cell antibody were 38% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 33% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This antibody did not relate directly to anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi>), although the serum samples positive for anti-goblet cell antibody were commonly positive for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation and <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis (PAGE) study showed that the antibody in the ELISA positive serum samples recognised a &gt; 200 kD goblet cell antigen, which remained unchanged after reduction, indicating that it consists of single chain <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that there is a subgroup of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> that has circulating anti-goblet cell antibody reactive with a &gt; 200 kD antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The antibody detected by newly established ELISA will be a disease marker for this group and the identification of the corresponding antigens may be important for the understanding of the underlying immune abnormalities </plain></SENT>
