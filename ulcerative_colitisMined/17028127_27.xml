<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Population based studies have revealed varying mortality for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> but most have described patients from limited geographical areas who were diagnosed before 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To assess overall mortality in a European cohort of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, 10 years after diagnosis, and to investigate national <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> related mortality across Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mortality 10 years after diagnosis was recorded in a prospective European-wide population based cohort of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> diagnosed in 1991-1993 from nine centres in seven European countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expected mortality was calculated from the sex, age and country specific mortality in the WHO Mortality Database for 1995-1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Standardised mortality ratios (SMR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At follow-up, 661 of 775 patients were alive with a median follow-up duration of 123 months (107-144) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 73 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (median follow-up time 61 months (1-133)) occurred compared with an expected 67 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall mortality risk was no higher: SMR 1.09 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mortality by sex was SMR 0.92 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.26) for males and SMR 1.39 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.93) for females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a slightly higher risk in older age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For disease specific mortality, a higher SMR was found only for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mortality by European region was SMR 1.19 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.53) for the north and SMR 0.82 (95% CI 0.45-1.37) for the south </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Higher mortality was not found in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> 10 years after disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, a significant rise in SMR for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e>, and a trend towards an age related rise in SMR, was observed </plain></SENT>
