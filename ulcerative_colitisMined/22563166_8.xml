<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Now, a variety of new biological monoclonal antibody agents, usually administered by infusion, have appeared in the clinical realm over the last decade or so to treat different <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory or malignant disorders.For some of these agents, adverse effects have been documented, including apparently new forms of immune-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In some, only limited symptoms have been recorded, but in others, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> with serious complications, such as bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> has been recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In others, adverse effects may have a direct vascular or ischemic basis, while other intestinal effects may be related to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superimposed infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> may also be attributed to the same agents used to treat these diseases, or be responsible for disease exacerbation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dramatic and well documented side effects have been observed with ipilimumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody developed to reduce and overcome cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4, a key negative feedback regulator of the T-cell anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This agent has frequently been used in the treatment of different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, notably, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>malignant melanoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Side effects with this agent occur in up to 40% and these are believed to be largely immune-mediated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One of these is a form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004387'>enterocolitis</z:hpo> that may be severe, and occasionally, fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other agents include rituximab (an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody), bevacizumab (a monoclonal antibody against the vascular endothelial growth factor) and anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor agents, including infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept </plain></SENT>
