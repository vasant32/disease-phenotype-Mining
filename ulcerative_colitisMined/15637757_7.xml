<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Recent studies suggest that Fas-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been hypothesized that either <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> of intestinal epithelium or <z:mp ids='MP_0006043'>decreased apoptosis</z:mp> of lamina propria lymphocytes may induce <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of gut </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether the Fas gene promoter polymorphism at position-670 was associated with IBD in Chinese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty unrelated Chinese patients with IBD (38 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 12 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>) and 124 healthy controls were genotyped for the Fas-670 polymorphism by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PCR product was digested by Mva I restriction enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Distribution of the Fas-670 gene polymorphism was 33% for the AA genotype, 52% for the AG genotype and 15% for the GG genotype in 124 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with IBD, 30% was for the AA genotype, 42% for the AG genotype and 28% for the GG genotype respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant difference in the genotype (P = 0.1498), allele frequencies (P = 0.3198) and carriage frequencies (P = 0.4133) between healthy controls and IBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we did not find any difference between the left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and total <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (P = 0.8242) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Fas-670 polymorphism is not associated with IBD in Chinese patients </plain></SENT>
