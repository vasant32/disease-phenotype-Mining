<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although recent work has suggested that an abnormality of the 0.05 Hz (3 c/m) slow wave electrical activity exists in the distal colon of patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022104" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IBS">irritable colon syndrome</z:e>, it is not established whether this is related to altered bowel habit alone, or whether it is specific to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022104" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IBS">irritable colon syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have therefore studied 10 patients referred with this disorder and compared their colonic myoelectrical pattern with 10 patients suffering from assorted disorders with similar symptoms--for example, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006280'>chronic pancreatitis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticular disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transit time, stool weights, percentage motility, and slow wave electrical activity were measured in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two groups were well matched for age and patients with similar symptoms in the two groups had similar values for transit time and percentage motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant increase in the 3 c/m electrical activity in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022104" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IBS">irritable colon syndrome</z:e> unrelated to the degree of diarrhoea or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It would appear, therefore, that the abnormally high incidence of 3 c/m electrical activity in the colon is specific to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022104" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IBS">irritable colon syndrome</z:e> and not merely a feature of altered bowel habit </plain></SENT>
