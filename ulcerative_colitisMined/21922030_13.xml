<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In 2010, four independent groups almost simultaneously reported the association of the novel interleukin-1 (IL-1) family member, IL-33, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The findings were remarkably consistent and demonstrated that IL-33 is markedly upregulated in, and specific to, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, although a variety of gut-associated immune cell subsets express IL-33, the primary source appears to be the intestinal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IL-33's receptor, ST2, a formerly orphaned IL-1 receptor-related protein, was also found to be increased in UC patients, although the cellular source of ST2 appears to be somewhat more ambiguous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In fact, emerging evidence indicates that the IL-33/ST2 axis plays a critical role in several other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the gut, IL-33 has been shown to be important in the clearance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021832" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal parasites</z:e>, and inducing epithelial cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, mucus production and mucosal eosinophilic infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, despite the established trend of increased IL-33 and ST2 expression during IBD, specifically UC, the precise pathophysiologic relevance of these findings has yet to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, IL-33 has the ability to potentiate pathogenic Th2 and Th17 responses in gut-associated lymphoid tissues, while also promoting healing of damaged mucosa following inflammatory insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Indeed, further mechanistic studies are warranted to confirm the possible dichotomous functions of IL-33 during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> and better define its precise role in the pathogenesis of IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Herein, we discuss what is currently known about IL-33/ST2 in the gut and speculate as to the potential role of the IL-33/ST2 system in IBD </plain></SENT>
