<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the healthcare costs and productivity losses in a large cohort of IBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) patients from seven university hospitals and seven general hospitals were invited to fill-out a web-based questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cost items were derived from a 3 month follow-up questionnaire and categorised in outpatient clinic, diagnostics, medication, surgery and hospitalisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Productivity losses included sick leave of paid and unpaid work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Costs were expressed as mean 3-month costs per patients with a 95% CI obtained using non-parametric bootstrapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1315 CD patients and 937 UC patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Healthcare costs were almost three times higher in CD as compared with UC, €1625 (95% CI €1476 to €1775) versus €595 (95% CI €505 to €685), respectively (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anti-TNFα use was the main costs driver, accounting for 64% and 31% of the total cost in CD and UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hospitalisation and surgery together accounted for 19% and &lt;1% of the healthcare costs in CD and 23% and 1% in UC, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Productivity losses accounted for 16% and 39% of the total costs in CD and UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We showed that healthcare costs are mainly driven by medication costs, most importantly by anti-TNFα therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Hospitalisation and surgery accounted only for a minor part of the healthcare costs </plain></SENT>
