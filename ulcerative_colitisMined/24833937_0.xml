<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Medical management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> has continued to evolve over more than half of a century </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Perhaps, the important advance was the development of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">sulfasalazine</z:chebi>, a drug initially used for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0683381" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory joint disease</z:e> and only later in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">Sulfasalazine</z:chebi> was a combination designer drug consisting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="132842">sulfapyridine</z:chebi>, a sulfa-containing <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33282">antibacterial agent</z:chebi>, and 5-amino-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30762">salicylate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>), an <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory agent</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Its value appeared to be its ability to target a therapeutic concentration of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> component of the medication primarily in the colon, largely avoiding proximal small intestinal absorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With increasing experience, however, it also became evident that many patients treated with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">sulfasalazine</z:chebi> developed intolerance to the drug and, in some rare instances, serious drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions, largely to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="132842">sulfapyridine</z:chebi> portion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a result, a number of alternative forms of delivery of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> were developed consisting of either a similar <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">sulfasalazine</z:chebi>-like <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50266">prodrug</z:chebi> formulation requiring <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> destruction of an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="30106">azo</z:chebi>-bond releasing the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> or a pH-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> packaging system that permitted release in the distal intestine, particularly in the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a result, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>-containing medications continue to provide a valuable management tool for remission induction in mildly to moderately active distal or extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, an additional option for more severely symptomatic disease and value for maintenance therapy with limited potential side effects, even with long-term use </plain></SENT>
