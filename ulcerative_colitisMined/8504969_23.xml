<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As unprotected <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> is rapidly absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract several slow release preparations have been developed to permit passage of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> to the lower small bowel and to the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> kinetics and extent of the release of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> intraluminal concentrations and loads of this compound together with that of its main metabolite <z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27565">aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi> (ac-5-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) were studied, over 15 hours after giving the slow release preparation <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">Salofalk</z:chebi> at a dose of 500 mg orally together with a test meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six healthy volunteers swallowed an 11 lumen oroileal tube, which allowed marker perfusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> content from the duodenum, mid-jejunum, and ileum, and recording of intestinal motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Emptying of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> into the duodenum started after emptying of the meal, together with the first phase III of interdigestive motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> and ac-5-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> increased continuously from duodenum (both: 15 to 30 micrograms/ml) to ileum (60 to 110 micrograms/ml and 80 to 150 micrograms/ml respectively) over three hours and decreased over the next three hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During 10 hours after eating, 30% of the total dose passed the ileum in solution and another 10% were excreted in urine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus about 60% reached the colon unreleased from tablets and another 30% were in solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ratio of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> and ac-5-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> in solution was about 1:1 in the duodenum and 1:1.5 to 1:2 in the more distal small intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that the large quantities of intraluminal ac-5-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> are generated in the intestinal mucosa and reach the lumen by back diffusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results show that most of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> from this slow release preparation is delivered into the colon, which explains its effectiveness in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The considerable <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> concentrations already present in the distal ileum might justify therapeutic trials in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
