<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aetiology and pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> remains unclear; however, there is increasing recognition of the critical role of inflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among these, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNF alpha) seems to play an important role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the effects of an engineered human monoclonal antibody to TNF alpha (CDP571) in the treatment of idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in the cottontop tamarin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six cottontop tamarins with confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> received repeated doses of CDP571 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Progression of disease was assessed by measuring both body weight and rectal biopsy pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals showed a rapid improvement in clinical condition and rectal biopsy pathology that was maintained following completion of the therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These studies indicate the efficacy of selective antibody therapy to TNF alpha for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in a primate and suggest that similar therapy in human could be of value </plain></SENT>
