<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lavender oil is a traditional medicine used to relieve many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to examine the therapeutic effects of the essential oil obtained from a novel lavender cultivar, Lavandula×intermedia cultivar Okanagan lavender (OLEO), in a mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100282'>acute colitis</z:hpo> caused by Citrobacter rodentium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In colitic mice, oral gavage with OLEO resulted in less severe disease, including decreased morbidity and mortality, reduced intestinal tissue damage, and decreased infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages, with reduced levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-22, macrophage inflammatory protein-2α, and inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was associated with increased levels of regulatory T cell populations compared with untreated colitic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recently, we demonstrated that the composition of the enteric microbiota affects susceptibility to C. rodentium-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here, we found that oral administration of OLEO induced microbiota enriched with members of the phylum Firmicutes, including segmented filamentous bacteria, which are known to protect against the damaging effects of C. rodentium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, OLEO treatment promoted the maintenance of microbiota loads, with specific increases in Firmicutes bacteria and decreases in γ-Proteobacteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We observed that Firmicutes bacteria were intimately associated with the apical region of the intestinal epithelial cells during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, suggesting that their protective effect was through contact with the gut wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, we show that OLEO inhibited C. rodentium growth and adherence to Caco-2 cells, primarily through the activities of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27961">1,8-cineole</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28093">borneol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that while OLEO promoted Firmicutes populations, it also controlled pathogen load through antimicrobial activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, our results reveal that OLEO can protect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> through the microbial-immunity nexus and that a pharmacological agent, in this case OLEO, alters the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> enteric microbiota </plain></SENT>
