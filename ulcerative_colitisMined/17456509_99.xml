<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Several antibodies have been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and are associated with distinct clinical phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether a panel of new antibodies against <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> could help in differentiating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD), and whether they were associated with particular clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Antibodies against a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28808">mannan</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (gASCA), laminaribioside (ALCA), chitobioside (ACCA), mannobioside (AMCA), outer membrane porins (Omp) and the atypical perinuclear antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA) were tested in serum samples of 1225 IBD patients, 200 healthy controls and 113 patients with non-IBD <z:hpo ids='HP_0004386'>gastrointestinal inflammation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antibody responses were correlated with the type of disease and clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 76% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients had at least one of the tested antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For differentiation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, the combination of gASCA and pANCA was most accurate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For differentiation between IBD, healthy controls and non-IBD <z:hpo ids='HP_0004386'>gastrointestinal inflammation</z:hpo>, the combination of gASCA, pANCA and ALCA had the best accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increasing amounts and levels of antibody responses against gASCA, ALCA, ACCA, AMCA and Omp were associated with more complicated disease behaviour (44.7% versus 53.6% versus 71.1% versus 82.0%, p &lt; 0.001), and a higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>-related abdominal surgery (38.5% versus 48.8% versus 60.7% versus 75.4%, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Using this new panel of serological markers, the number and magnitude of immune responses to different microbial antigens were shown to be associated with the severity of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With regard to the predictive role of serological markers, further prospective longitudinal studies are necessary </plain></SENT>
