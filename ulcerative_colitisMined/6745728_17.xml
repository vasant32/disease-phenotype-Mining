<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new approach to the problem of monitoring patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> is presented and discussed in connection with a case report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When annual colonoscopies are performed, biopsies are taken for histopathological examination and DNA measurements are made using flow-cytometric techniques (FCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the latter approach, gross chromosomal aberrations indicating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> in a cell population may be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a 46 year old man with a long history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, an area with slight mucosal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> at light microscopy was accompanied by two aneuploid cells lines - that is, colonic mucosa cells with an abnormal amount of DNA in the nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An operation one year later revealed a 5 X 2 mm large <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in the corresponding area of the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We suggest that flow-cytometric techniques can be used as a complement to already practised methods for monitoring the colorectal mucosa in colitic patients for the early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
