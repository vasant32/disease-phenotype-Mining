<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventeen cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> associated orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo> and 3 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> associated orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo> have been reported in the published literature since 1970 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the use of adalimumab (Abbott, Canada, Inc.) for orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo> in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> who discontinued infliximab (Janssen, Canada, Inc.) and review of the published literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: A 35 year-old male with a 7-year history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> was treated with an ileocolonic resection and re-anastomosis followed by infliximab which maintained full endoscopic and clinical remission for four years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After stopping the infliximab for infusion-related reactions he presented with 3-day history of severe right eye pain, pain with ocular movement, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>proptosis</z:hpo>, and conjunctival injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He had no intestinal symptoms and endoscopic assessment revealed no active <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CT of the orbit revealed an enlarged right medial rectus muscle with tendonous involvement and a diagnosis of orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo> was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with 80 mg per day <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> with tapering dose and adalimumab, induction and maintenance, resulted in rapid resolution of the orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo> and ocular symptoms with no recurrences on follow-up at 10 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current case demonstrates a rare extraintestinal manifestation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo>, and its temporal relationship to the discontinuance of infliximab therapy and its successful treatment, without recurrence with tapering <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> and adalimumab </plain></SENT>
