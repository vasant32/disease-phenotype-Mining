<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological studies have shown an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) in non-smokers and particularly recent ex-smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with UC have an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> following ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, which may be a manifestation of the original disease susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that smoking habit may influence the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with a functioning pouch &gt; or = 12 months at one centre were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were excluded if (a) the original indication was not UC (n = 5), (b) the excised pouch showed histology diagnostic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (n = 2), and (c) data were inadequate (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Smoking data were collected by questionnaire, or direct interview, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ex-smokers were those who had stopped smoking &lt; 7 years before colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Non-smokers included ex-smokers who had stopped &gt; 7 years before colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pouchitis</z:e> was defined as an increase in stool frequency &gt; 8/day with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> on biopsy specimen histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Each presentation requiring treatment was regarded as an episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For comparison smoking habit was assessed with regard to three other adverse outcomes - haemorrhage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, and pouch excision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of 72 non-smokers (mean follow up 3.5 years) 18 had 46 episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of 12 ex-smokers (mean follow up 3.3 years) four patients have had 14 episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Only one smoker from 17 has had a single episode of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This shows that smokers have significantly less episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> compared with non-smokers (p = 0.0005) and ex-smokers (p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was no association of smoking habit with other adverse outcomes </plain></SENT>
