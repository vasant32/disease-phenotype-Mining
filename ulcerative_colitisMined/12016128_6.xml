<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we characterized the T cell receptor (TCR)-delta repertoire by complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) spectratyping in the inflamed and noninflamed mucosa and in the peripheral blood of subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast to previously published data about alpha/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36018">beta T</z:chebi> cells, we rarely found oligoclonal expansions of gamma/delta T cells specific only for the inflamed mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The same dominant gamma/delta T cell expansions were also present in the noninflamed colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the peripheral gamma/delta TCR repertoire was oligoclonal but clearly distinct from that in the inflamed intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus our results do not support a role for antigen-specific gamma/delta T cells in IBD, and dominant gamma/delta T cells of the peripheral blood are not likely to be derived from the inflamed gut </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in several patients, the TCR-delta-repertoire was highly diversified, whereas in others we observed a loss of dominant gamma/delta T cell clones when inflamed and noninflamed mucosa were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, those changes indicate that gamma/delta T cells might play an important role in a subset of patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
