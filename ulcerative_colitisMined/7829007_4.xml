<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have shown amplified immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody response in UC; however the immunoreactive antigen(s) is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To study this antigen(s), mucosal colonic extract was prepared by sonication, ultracentrifugation followed by ion exchange chromatography in fast protein liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fraction (enriched colonic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>), that was most reactive to a novel monoclonal antibody, 7E12H12 (IgM isotype), was isolated and used to examine the immunoreactivity against the patients' serum samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and thirteen coded samples from 111 patients with UC (symptomatic and untreated (63), symptomatic and treated (26), remission (22)); 47 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) (40 were symptomatic and untreated, and 30 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">colonic disease</z:e>); 29 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> diarrhoea caused by specific pathogen(s); 10 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, and 16 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects were examined against the enriched colonic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> by IgG subtype specific enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total IgG antibody reactivity was significantly (p &lt; 0.01) higher only in symptomatic and untreated UC patients compared with each of the non-UC group, but the sensitivity was only 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IgG2 and IgG3 reactivities were not different among various groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The IgG1 antibody reactivity against the enriched colonic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, however, differentiated UC patients from CD and each of the other non-UC groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventy nine per cent of the patients with UC, treated or untreated, symptomatic or in remission, had significantly (p &lt; 0.0001) higher IgG1 antibody against the enriched colonic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> when compared with each of the other non-UC groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 12% of CD serum samples and none of the other control serum samples reacted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using purified serum IgG1 and 7E12H12-IgM, by 7E12H12 reactive <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> indeed reacts with UC-IgG1 antibody but not with control IgG1 </plain></SENT>
