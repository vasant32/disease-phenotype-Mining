<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Dietary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17351">linoleic acid</z:chebi>, an n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, is metabolised to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi>, a component of colonocyte membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Metabolites of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> have pro-inflammatory properties and are increased in the mucosa of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this investigation was to conduct the first prospective cohort study investigating if a high dietary intake of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17351">linoleic acid</z:chebi> increases the risk of developing incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: Dietary data from food frequency questionnaires were available for 203 193 men and women aged 30-74 years, resident in the UK, Sweden, Denmark, Germany or Italy and participating in a prospective cohort study, the European Prospective Investigation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and Nutrition (EPIC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These participants were followed up for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each case was matched with four controls and the risk of disease calculated by quartile of intake of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17351">linoleic acid</z:chebi> adjusted for gender, age, smoking, total energy intake and centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 126 participants developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (47% women) after a median follow-up of 4.0 years (range, 1.7-11.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The highest quartile of intake of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17351">linoleic acid</z:chebi> was associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (odds ratio (OR) = 2.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.23 to 5.07, p = 0.01) with a significant trend across quartiles (OR = 1.32 per quartile increase, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.66, p = 0.02 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data support a role for dietary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17351">linoleic acid</z:chebi> in the aetiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An estimated 30% of cases could be attributed to having dietary intakes higher than the lowest quartile of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17351">linoleic acid</z:chebi> intake </plain></SENT>
