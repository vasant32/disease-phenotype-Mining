<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) has accumulated and the disease is widely assumed to be the consequence of genetic susceptibility and an abnormal immune response to commensal bacteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However evidence regarding an infectious etiology in UC remains elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: We report a provocative case of UC with profound rheumatologic involvement directly preceded by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0343386" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Clostridium difficile infection</z:e> and accompanying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>bloody diarrhea</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Colonic biopsy revealed a histopathology suggestive of UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antibiotic treatment eliminated detectable levels of enteric pathogens but did not <z:chebi fb="72" ids="38954">abate</z:chebi> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Resolution of symptoms was procurable with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, but tapering of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> was only achievable in combination therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28001">vancomycin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6909">metronidazole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An infectious pathogen may have both precipitated and exacerbated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> attributes in UC, symptoms of which could be resolved only with a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28001">vancomycin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6909">metronidazole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This may warrant the need for more perceptive scrutiny of C. difficile and the like in patients with UC </plain></SENT>
