<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The total LD content was found to be significantly increased in patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> when compared with patients with inactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> or with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was a similar though not a significant increase in the slow moving isoenzymes of LD in samples of rectal mucosa from patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The LD isoenzyme pattern was in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in two of the three patients with histological premalignant changes in rectal biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant linear correlation between the total lactic dehydrogenase content of rectal mucosa and the carcino-embryonic antigen levels in whole serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both the total content and isoenzyme ratios of LD were increased in neoplastic tissue obtained from patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the colon and with tissue from benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0100896'>rectal polyps</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
