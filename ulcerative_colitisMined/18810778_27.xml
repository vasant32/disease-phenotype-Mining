<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate fecal calprotectin (FC) as a surrogate marker of treatment outcome of relapse of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) and, to compare FC with fecal myeloperoxidase (MPO) and fecal eosinophil protein X (EPX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty eight patients with IBD, comprising of 27 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and 11 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) were investigated before treatment (inclusion), and after 4 and 8 wk of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment outcomes were evaluated by clinical features of disease activity and endoscopy in UC patients, and disease activity in CD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, fecal samples were analyzed for FC by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and for MPO and EPX with radioimmunoassay (RIA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At inclusion 37 of 38 (97%) patients had elevated FC levels (&gt; 94.7 microg/g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the end of the study, 31 of 38 (82%) patients fulfilled predefined criteria of a complete response [UC 21/27 (78%); CD 10/11 (91%)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, a normalised FC level at the end of the study predicted a complete response in 100% patients, whereas elevated FC level predicted incomplete response in 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Normalised MPO or EPX levels predicted a complete response in 100% and 90% of the patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, elevated MPO or EPX levels predicted incomplete response in 23% and 22%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A normalised FC level has the potential to be used as a surrogate marker for successful treatment outcome in IBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, patients with persistent elevation of FC levels need further evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>FC and MPO provide superior discrimination than EPX in IBD treatment outcome </plain></SENT>
