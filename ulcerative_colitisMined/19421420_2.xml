<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigates the role that selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in the TNF-alpha receptor (TNSFRSF1B) gene play in the risk of IBD in a New Zealand Caucasian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA samples from 388 CD, 405 UC, 27 indeterminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> patients, and 293 randomly selected controls, from Canterbury, New Zealand were screened for 3 common SNPs in TNSFRSF1B: rs1061622 (c.676T &gt; C), rs1061624 (c.*1663A &gt; G), and rs3397 (c.*1690T &gt; C), using TaqMan technologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Carrying the rs1061624 variant decreased the risk of UC in the left colon (OR 0.73, 95% CI = 0.54-1.00) and of being a smoker at diagnosis (OR 0.62; 95% CI = 0.40-0.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carrying the rs3397 variant decreased the risk of penetrating CD (OR 0.62, 95% CI = 0.40-0.95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three marker haplotype analyses revealed highly significant differences between CD patients and control subjects (chi(2) = 29.9, df = 7, P = .0001) and UC cases and controls (chi(2) = 46.3, df = 7, P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that carrying a 3-marker haplotype in the TNSFRSF1B gene may increase (e.g., haplotype of GGC was 2.9-fold more in the CD or UCpatients) or decrease (e.g., TGT was 0.47-fold less in UC patients) the risk of IBD in a New Zealand Caucasian population </plain></SENT>
