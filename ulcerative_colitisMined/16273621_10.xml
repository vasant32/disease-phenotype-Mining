<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the prevalence and clinical significance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> (hHcys), an independent factor for arterial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, in a group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fasting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15356">Hcys</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, and vitamin B(12) serum levels were measured in 40 UC patients and 50 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical data regarding UC were gathered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15356">Hcys</z:chebi> levels in UC patients were similar to controls (12.26 micromol/L vs 12.32 micromol/L), but the prevalence of hHcys was higher in UC patients than in controls (30% vs 10%, P = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>UC significantly increased the risk of hHcys (adjusted odds ratio: 4.125; 95%CI: 1.26-13.44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression analysis showed that male sex, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and vitamin B(12) deficiency or lower serum values were significant independent predictors of higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15356">Hcys</z:chebi> levels in UC patients (r(2) = 0.4; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HHcys is common in UC patients and it is related to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and vitamin B(12) deficiency or lower serum values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It would be reasonable for patients with UC to receive <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and vitamin B complex supplements as a prophylactic measure </plain></SENT>
