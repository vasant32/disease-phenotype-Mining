<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Probiotics contain living microorganisms which exert health effects on the host </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the efficacy in maintaining remission of the probiotic preparation Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 and established therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, 327 patients were recruited and assigned to a double blind, double dummy trial to receive either the probiotic drug 200 mg once daily (n = 162) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> 500 mg three times daily (n = 165) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study lasted for 12 months and patients were assessed by clinical and endoscopic activity indices (Rachmilewitz) as well as by histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary aim of the study was to confirm equivalent efficacy of the two drugs in the prevention of relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The per protocol analysis revealed relapses in 40/110 (36.4%) patients in the E coli Nissle 1917 group and 38/112 (33.9%) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> group (significant equivalence p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analyses showed no differences between the treatment groups in terms of duration and localisation of disease or pretrial treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Safety profile and tolerability were very good for both groups and were not different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The probiotic drug E coli Nissle 1917 shows efficacy and safety in maintaining remission equivalent to the gold standard <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of probiotic treatment further underlines the pathogenetic significance of the enteric flora </plain></SENT>
