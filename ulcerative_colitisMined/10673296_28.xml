<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence that intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are involved in the mucosal immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the pattern of cytokines secreted by IECs and lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMNCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To achieve this, the expression and secretion of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (IL-1ra), IL-6, and IL-8 in human primary colonic and ileal IECs and LPMNCs from the same patient were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IECs and LPMNCs were isolated from surgical specimens or endoscopic biopsy samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was investigated by northern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secretion of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1ra was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IL-1ra <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were higher in IECs than in LPMNCs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> probands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IL-8 mRNA was only present in low amounts in the IECs from two controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In none of the specimens were IL-1beta and IL-6 mRNA present in IECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transcripts encoding IL-1beta, IL-1ra, IL-6, and IL-8 were identified in LPMNC preparations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IECs from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa produced no detectable amounts of IL-1beta or IL-6, whereas LPMNCs did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IECs secreted some IL-8 (65 (9) pg/10(5) cells) but significantly more was generated by LPMNCs (408 (43) pg/10(5) cells, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, IECs secreted more IL-1ra than did LPMNCs (120 (12) v 94 (11) pg/10(5) cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, IEC IL-1ra secretion was significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A correlation between secreted IL-1ra and the macroscopical degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (r = 0.64, p&lt;0.0001, n = 36) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (r = 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>76, p&lt;0.0001, n = 24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IECs from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa express and secrete IL-1ra and low amounts of IL-8, but no IL-1 or IL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In inflamed mucosa the secretion of IL-1ra by IECs is slightly increased but may be not sufficient to antagonise the greatly increased production of proinflammatory cytokines by LPMNCs and the IECs themselves </plain></SENT>
