<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, biological effect of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> (PG) D(2) on <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the expression of enzymes for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi>(2) synthesis, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> D synthase (PGDS), and its relation to the activity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The role of lipocalin-type PGDS (L-PGDS) using a murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> model was also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue samples were obtained by colonic biopsies from patients with UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> for L-PGDS and hematopoietic-type PGDS were investigated by quantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>COX-2 and L-PGDS expression was investigated by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Localization of L-PGDS expression was also determined by in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In experimental study, mice were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32149">sodium sulfate</z:chebi> in the drinking water to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The degree of colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was compared with L-PGDS(-/-) mice and control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The level of L-PGDS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was increased in UC patients in parallel with disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Colocalization of L-PGDS and cyclooxygenase (COX) 2 was observed in lamina proprial infiltrating cells and muscularis mucosa in UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The level of hematopoietic PGDS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression did not differ from control mucosa </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We reported for the first time the presence of L-PGDS in the COX-2-expressing cells in the mucosa of active UC patients and that only L-PGDS increased with disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>An animal model study suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi>(2) derived from L-PGDS-expressing cells plays proinflammatory roles in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
