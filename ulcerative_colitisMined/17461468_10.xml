<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mice were divided into a DSS-untreated group (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group), DSS-treated control group, DSS+PDTC-treated group I (low-dose group), and DSS+PDTC-treated group II (high-dose group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In each group, the disease activity index score (DAI score), intestinal length, histological score, and the levels of activated NF-kappaB and inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta and TNF-alpha) in tissue were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The DSS+PDTC-treated group II exhibited suppression of shortening of intestinal length and reduction of DAI score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Activated NF-kappaB level and IL-1beta and TNF-alpha levels were significantly lower in DSS+PDTC-treated group II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that PDTC is useful for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
