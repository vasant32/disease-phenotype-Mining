<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 155 patients with established <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 139 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects were selected as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two single nucleotide polymorphisms within the promoter region of TGF-beta1 gene (-509C &gt; T and -800G &gt; A) were genotyped using PCR-RFLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference in genotype and allele frequency distributions between UC patients and controls for the -800G &gt; A polymorphism of the TGF-beta1 gene (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the TGF-beta1 gene polymorphism at position -800 showed that the AA genotype and the allele A frequencies significantly differed between the patients and healthy controls (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At position -509, there was no statically significant difference in genotype and allele frequency between the patients and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of our study indicate that there is a significant difference in both allele and genotype frequency at position -800G &gt; A of TGF-beta1 gene promoter between Iranian patients with UC and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
