<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: An increased occurrence of anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) is reported in unaffected members of families with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether ASCA is a familial trait due to genetic factors or is caused by exposure to environmental factors is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess the genetic influence of ASCA we studied its occurrence in a twin population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: ASCA were analysed in 98 twin pairs with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> and were related to clinical phenotype and CARD15/NOD2 genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ASCA were more common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (40/70 (57%) twins v 5/43 (12%) twins) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associations with ileal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, stricturing/penetrating behaviour, and young age, but not CARD15/NOD2 were confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ASCA were found in 1/20 (5%) healthy siblings in discordant monozygotic pairs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> compared with 7/27 (26%) in discordant dizygotic pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using the intraclass correlation coefficient (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e>), no agreement in ASCA titres was observed in discordant twin pairs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, in monozygotic (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> = -0.02) or dizygotic (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> = -0.26) pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, strong agreement was seen within concordant monozygotic twin pairs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> = 0.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings question the concept of ASCA as a marker of genetic susceptibility for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The agreement in ASCA titres within concordant monozygotic twin pairs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, suggests that the level of increase is genetically determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We propose that ASCA are a marker of a response to an environmental antigen and that a specific gene(s) other than CARD15/NOD2 determines the level of response and perhaps also specific phenotypic characteristics </plain></SENT>
