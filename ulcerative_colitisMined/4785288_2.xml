<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following rectal instillation of (125)I-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53248">polyvinylpyrrolidone</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53245">PVP</z:chebi>), the molecular size distribution of labelled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53245">PVP</z:chebi> in urine samples was determined by Sephadex gel filtration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results of the study suggest that the increased permeability of the inflamed rectal mucosa to electrolytes and small hydrophilic compounds is due primarily to ultrastructural changes since only the low molecular fractions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53245">PVP</z:chebi> were found in the urine </plain></SENT>
