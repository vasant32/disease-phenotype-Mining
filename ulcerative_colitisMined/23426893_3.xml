<SENT sid="1" pm="?"><plain>Do humans have a similar inner mucus layer and are defects in this mucus layer a common denominator for spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in mice models and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The colon mucus layer from mice deficient in Muc2 mucin, Core 1 O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi>, Tlr5, interleukin 10 (IL-10) and Slc9a3 (Nhe3) together with that from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32149">sodium sulfate</z:chebi>-treated mice was immunostained for Muc2, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> localisation in the mucus was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> models revealed bacteria in contact with the epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional analysis of the less inflamed IL-10(-/-) mice revealed a thicker mucus layer than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>, but the properties were different, as the inner mucus layer could be penetrated both by bacteria in vivo and by fluorescent beads the size of bacteria ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clear separation between bacteria or fluorescent beads and the epithelium mediated by the inner mucus layer was also evident in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human sigmoid colon biopsy samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, mucus on colon biopsy specimens from patients with UC with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was highly penetrable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most patients with UC in remission had an impenetrable mucus layer similar to that of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> human sigmoid colon has an inner mucus layer that is impenetrable to bacteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The colon mucus in animal models that spontaneously develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and in patients with active UC allows bacteria to penetrate and reach the epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus colon mucus properties can be modulated, and this suggests a novel model of UC pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
