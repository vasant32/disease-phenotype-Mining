<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The concentration of myeloperoxidase, a neutrophil granule constituent, was measured in the perfusion fluid from sigmoid and rectal segments in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of myeloperoxidase were increased severalfold in the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> compared with healthy controls pointing to an enhanced neutrophil activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The release of myeloperoxidase correlated to an enhanced local release of the neutrophil activating <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> interleukin-8 (IL-8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased values of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF-alpha) were also found during intestinal perfusion of the patients and correlated with those of IL-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results obtained are compatible with the hypothesis that local mucosal recruitment/activation of neutrophils in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> is mediated by an enhanced IL-8 synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha may be one relevant factor as a stimulus to IL-8 synthesis </plain></SENT>
