<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Antibodies to infliximab reduce serum infliximab with loss of clinical benefit, but undetectable trough serum concentrations of infliximab may occur without antibody formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationship between trough serum infliximab and clinical outcomes was evaluated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a cohort of 115 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> treated with three-dose induction followed by scheduled maintenance infliximab, rates of clinical remission, colectomy, antibodies to infliximab and trough serum infliximab were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rates of remission were 32% at week 10 and 37% at week 54 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colectomy occurred in 40% of patients, at a median of 5.3 (IQR 1.9-12.1) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Detectable trough serum infliximab was present in 39% of patients and, among patients with undetectable infliximab, 41% were antibody positive and 20% were antibody negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For antibody-positive and antibody-negative patients, rates of remission (18% vs 14%), endoscopic improvement (25% vs 35%) and colectomy (52% vs 59%) were not different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A detectable serum infliximab was associated with higher rates of remission (69% vs 15%; p&lt;0.001) and endoscopic improvement (76% vs 28%, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An undetectable serum infliximab predicted an increased risk for colectomy (55% vs 7%, OR 9.3; 95% CI 2.9 to 29.9; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Concurrent immunosuppression was not associated with clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> treated with infliximab, a detectable trough serum infliximab predicts clinical remission, endoscopic improvement and a lower risk for colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An undetectable trough serum infliximab, irrespective of antibody status, is associated with less favourable outcomes </plain></SENT>
