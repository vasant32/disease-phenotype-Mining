<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Taking advantage of the inhibitory actions of interferon β on IL-13 expression, this proof-of-concept study aimed to show that decreasing IL-13 production is associated with clinical improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Open-label interventional drug trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Outpatient clinical research hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients Adult patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (Short Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>Colitis</z:hpo> Activity Index (SCCAI)≥ 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interventions Treatment with 30 μg IM interferon-β-1a (Avonex) weekly for 12 weeks with 6 month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical response was defined as ≥ 3 point drop in the SCCAI for at least two consecutive monitoring visits, and cytokine production was measured in cultured peripheral blood and lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 11 of 16 patients were clinical responders, and 4 were in remission (SCCAI ≤ 2) at the end of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>Rectal bleeding</z:hpo> subscores improved dramatically by week 4 (38% with frank <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> vs 87% pretreatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased IL-13 production by LPMC T cells fell significantly in clinical responders (690 ± 99 vs 297 ± 58 pg/ml p = 0.015) but was unchanged in non-responders (542 ± 83 vs 510 ± 39 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, non-responders had significantly higher production of IL-17 and IL-6 pre-treatment compared to responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Interferon-β-1a induces clinical response and remission in a large subset of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> that is associated with significant inhibition of IL-13 production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, increased IL-17 and IL-6 production is associated with no response to interferon-β </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data provide a proof-of-concept that IL-13 is an effector cytokine in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and should be a target for novel therapies </plain></SENT>
