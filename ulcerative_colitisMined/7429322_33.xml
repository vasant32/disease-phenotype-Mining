<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In untreated colitics in remission and in relapse, median values for apparent mucosal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi>) release were increased three-fold (P &lt; 0.05) and 13-fold (P &lt; 0.002) respectively over that found in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients in remission during treatment with sulphasalazine and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, median apparent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> release was similar to that of controls, but in colitics in relapse, despite treatment, it was greatly increased (P&lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in relapse was associated with a significant reduction in rectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>(P &lt; 0.002); in patients with quiescent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, a smaller reduction was found (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In nine patients studied serially before and during treatment, there were associations between changes in disease activity assessed sigmoidoscopically, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> and in apparent mucosal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, rectal mucosal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> release and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> were linearly correlated (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that mucosal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> release is markedly enhanced in active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and they confirm the value of rectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> as a guide to disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, they suggest that rectal dialysis may be a useful way of studying rectal <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> metabolism in man </plain></SENT>
