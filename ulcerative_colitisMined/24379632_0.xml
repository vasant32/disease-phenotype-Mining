<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate seasonal variations in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and relapse of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) in Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1994 and 2006, 198 Japanese patients diagnosed with UC according to conventional criteria in an academic hospital were enrolled for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 265 Japanese patients with UC who were observed for more than 12 mo, 165 patients relapsed (239 times) and were enrolled for relapse evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients' symptoms were recorded each month for 12 consecutive years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was monthly seasonality in symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> during October and March for UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms in UC patients frequently occurred during the winter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Variation in UC <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was observed according to both month (P = 0.015) and season (P = 0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relapse commonly occurred in October, and variations in relapse were not significant either in month (P = 0.52) or season (P = 0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Upper respiratory <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was the main factor responsible for relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that environmental factors associated with winter and spring seasonality may be responsible for triggering the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of UC in Japan </plain></SENT>
