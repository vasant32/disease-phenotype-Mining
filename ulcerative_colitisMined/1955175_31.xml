<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The presence of antibodies against pancreatic juice (PAB) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> has recently been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our study sera from 273 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (222 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 51 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>) have been examined for PAB and also for antibodies against gut tissues by means of indirect immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PAB were found in 68 of the 222 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (31%), with titres ranging from 1/10 to 1/1280, and in only two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (4%), with titres of 1/20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None were found in 198 patients with various <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> and healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No differences were found between the PAB positive and negative patients when the following parameters were compared: disease activity (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> activity index), involvement of bowel segments, incidence of extraintestinal disease, or treatment with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only seven of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> had a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030286" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pancreatic disease</z:e> and of these, four had detectable pancreatic antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal observations of 40 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> showed a stable pattern for PAB, independent of disease activity and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Partial characterisation of the PAB antigen, isolated from pancreatic juice, showed a trypsin sensitive macromolecular protein of more than 10(6) daltons not identical with a panel of defined exocrine pancreatic proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By contrast, antibodies against goblet cells (GAB) were found in 13 of 51 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (29%) and in none of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> or control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PAB were found as a highly specific serological marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and GAB for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, but the relevance of PAB and GAB in the pathogenesis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
