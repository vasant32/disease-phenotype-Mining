<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Emerging evidence supports this statement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, but it also seems to be very important in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory settings, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> have an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo>, and several abnormalities concerning coagulation components occur in the endothelial cells of intestinal vessels, where most severe inflammatory abnormalities occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aims of this review are to update and classify the type of coagulation system abnormalities in IBD, and analyze the strict and delicate balance between coagulation and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> at the mucosal level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recent studies on possible therapeutic applications arising from investigations on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormalities</z:hpo> associated with IBD pathogenesis will also be briefly presented and critically reviewed </plain></SENT>
