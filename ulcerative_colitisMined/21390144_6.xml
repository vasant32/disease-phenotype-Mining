<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Record linked abstracts of birth registrations, maternity, day case and inpatient admissions in a defined population of southern England </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Investigation of 20 perinatal factors relating to the maternity or the birth: maternal age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) in the mother, maternal social class, marital status, smoking in pregnancy, ABO blood group and rhesus status, pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo>, parity, the infant's presentation at birth, caesarean delivery, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011411'>forceps delivery</z:hpo>, sex, number of babies delivered, gestational age, birthweight, head circumference, breastfeeding and Apgar scores at one and five minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Maternity records were present for 180 children who subsequently developed IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed increased risks of CD among children of mothers with CD (P = 0.011, based on two cases of CD in both mother and child) and children of mothers who smoked during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis confirmed increased risks of CD among children of mothers who smoked (odds ratio = 2.04, 95% CI = 1.06-3.92) and for older mothers aged 35+ years (4.81, 2.32-9.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that there were no significant associations between CD and 17 other perinatal risk factors investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It also showed that, for UC, there were no significant associations with the perinatal factors studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study shows an association between CD in mother and child; and elevated risks of CD in children of older mothers and of mothers who smoked </plain></SENT>
