<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">Luminal</z:chebi> nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) is greatly increased in the colon of patients with collagenous and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To define the source and consequence of enhanced NO production we have studied expression of NO synthase (NOS) isoforms and nitrotyrosine in mucosal biopsies from these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, effects on colonic fluid transfer caused by manipulating the substrate of NOS were studied in patients with collagenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Eight patients with collagenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, nine with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and 10 with uninflamed bowel were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Expression of NOS isoforms was quantified by western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inducible NOS (iNOS) and nitrotyrosine were localised by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Modulation of NOS activity by topical N(G)-monomethyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28229">L-NMMA</z:chebi>) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> was assessed during perfusion of whole colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma and perfusate <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi>/nitrate (NOx) was measured by Griess' reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both in collagenous and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, expression of iNOS was 10(2)-10(3) higher (p&lt;0.001) than in uninflamed bowel and localised primarily to the epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Endothelial NOS was evenly expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups while neuronal NOS was undetectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nitrotyrosine was markedly expressed in active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> but rarely detected in collagenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and never in uninflamed bowel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In collagenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, the output of NOx was markedly increased compared with uninflamed bowel (283 (58) v &lt;37 nmol/min; p&lt;0.01) and fluid was net secreted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28229">L-NMMA</z:chebi> reduced the output of NOx by 13-66% (95% confidence intervals) and secretion of fluid by 25-109% whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> increased the output of NOx by 3-39% and secretion of fluid by 15-93% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In collagenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, as opposed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, upregulation of iNOS occurs in the absence of nitrotyrosine formation and mucosal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Excess generation of NO may be the primary cause of diarrhoea in this condition </plain></SENT>
