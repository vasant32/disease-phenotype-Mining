<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A number of antibodies against microbial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> or self-antigens have been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The development of antibodies reflects a loss of tolerance to intestinal bacteria that underlies <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, resulting in an exaggerated adaptive immune response to these bacteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was hypothesised that the development of antimicrobial antibodies is influenced by the presence of genetic variants in pattern recognition receptor genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the influence of mutations in these innate immune receptor genes (nucleotide oligomerisation domain (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e>) 2/caspase recruitment domain (CARD) 15, NOD1/CARD4, TUCAN/CARDINAL/CARD8, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, TLR2, TLR1 and TLR6) on the development of antimicrobial and antiglycan antibodies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Materials and METHODS: A cohort of 1163 unrelated patients with IBD (874 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 259 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, 30 indeterminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>) and 312 controls were analysed for anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (gASCA) IgG, anti-laminaribioside antibodies (ALCA) IgG, anti-chitobioside antibodies (ACCA) IgA, anti-mannobioside antibodies (AMCA) IgG and outer membrane porin (Omp) IgA and were genotyped for variants in NOD2/CARD15, TUCAN/CARDINAL/CARD8, NOD1/CARD4, TLR4, TLR1, TLR2 and TLR6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients without CARD15 mutations, the presence of at least one CARD15 variant in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients more frequently led to gASCA positivity (66.1% versus 51.5%, p &lt; 0.0001) and ALCA positivity (43.3% versus 34.9%, p = 0.018) and higher gASCA titers (85.7 versus 51.8 ELISA units, p &lt; 0.0001), independent of ileal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A gene dosage effect, with increasing gASCA and ALCA positivity for patients carrying none, one and two CARD15 variants, respectively, was seen for both markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients carrying NOD1/CARD4 indel had a higher prevalence of gASCA antibodies than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> patients (63.8% versus 55.2%, p = 0.014), also with a gene dosage effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An opposite effect was observed for the TLR4 D299G and TLR2 P631H variants, with a lower prevalence of ACCA antibodies (23.4% versus 35%, p = 0.013) and Omp antibodies (20.5% versus 34.6%, p = 0.009), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Variants in innate immune receptor genes were found to influence antibody formation against microbial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this respect, it is intriguing that an opposite effect of CARD15 and TLR4 variants was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings may contribute to an understanding of the aetiology of the seroreactivity observed in IBD </plain></SENT>
