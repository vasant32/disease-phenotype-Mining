<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Geographical variation in the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) according to the latitude of residence has been reported in Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are no comparable data in the USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of CD and UC in relation to latitude was assessed in a geographically diverse population of women enrolled in two large prospective studies in the USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A prospective study was undertaken of women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study I (NHS) in 1976 and in the NHS II in 1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Information on state of residence at the time of birth, at age 15 years and age 30 years was collected in 1992 in NHS I and in 1993 in NHS II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reported diagnoses of incident CD or UC to the end of 2003 were confirmed by medical record review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate HRs and 95% CIs for risk of CD and UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both cohorts, among 175,912 women reporting their residence in 1992, 257 cases of CD and 313 cases of UC were documented over 3,428,376 person-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of CD and UC increased significantly with increasing latitude (p(trend)&lt;0.01), with residence at age 30 years more strongly associated with risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with women residing in northern latitudes at age 30, the multivariate-adjusted HR for women residing in southern latitudes was 0.48 (95% CI 0.30 to 0.77) for CD and 0.62 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.90) for UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The effect of latitude of residence on risk of CD and UC did not vary according to smoking history (p(interaction)=0.26 for CD and 0.99 for UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In a population of US women, increasing latitude of residence was associated with a higher incidence of CD and UC </plain></SENT>
