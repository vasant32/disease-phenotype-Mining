<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance colonography (MRC) for the evaluation of disease activity and severity in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) using endoscopy as the reference standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty patients with UC underwent colonoscopy and MRC for the evaluation of disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were prospectively and consecutively included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic activity was evaluated globally and on a segment basis using the modified Baron score (MBS), and also classified as absent, mild to moderate (<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>) or severe (presence of ulceration) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRC parameters evaluated in each segment were: wall thickness, pre- and post-contrast wall signal intensity, relative contrast enhancement (RCE), mural <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, <z:mp ids='MP_0000702'>enlarged lymph nodes</z:mp> and the comb sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Independent predictors for endoscopic activity on a segment basis were RCE (p=0.006), presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> (p=0.003), <z:mp ids='MP_0000702'>enlarged lymph nodes</z:mp> (p&lt;0.001) and the comb sign (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A segmental simplified MRC index (MRC-S) ≥ 1 detected endoscopic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> with high diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity 87%, specificity 88%, area under the curve (AUC) 0.95; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MRC-S index ≥ 2 detected severe lesions with high sensitivity (83%) and specificity (82%) with an AUC of 0.91 (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The MRC-S index strongly correlated with the MBS (r=0.81, p&lt;0.001) and with the subjective assessment of the radiologists for the evaluation of disease severity (r=0.77, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MRC has a high accuracy for the diagnosis of disease activity and severity in UC </plain></SENT>
