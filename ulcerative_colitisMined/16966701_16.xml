<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 62 year old man with longstanding <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and previous endoscopic excision of two <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> associated lesions or masses (DALMs) was admitted to our endoscopy unit for evaluation and resection of other possible DALMs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He had previously been offered and refused colectomy because of comorbidity from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He had multiple polypoid and sessile lesions which were assessed using a third generation prototype narrow band imaging (NBI) colonoscope with magnification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Selected lesions were either biopsied or resected with a combination of endoscopic submucosal dissection and endoscopic mucosal resection techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We correlated the pit pattern and vascular pattern intensity seen with magnification NBI with histology of both inflammatory and dysplastic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dysplastic areas showed Kudo pit patterns II, IIIL, and IV and high vascular pattern intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Non-dysplastic and dysplastic areas of recurrence immediately adjacent to the scar from a previous endoscopic mucosal resection site were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first case report where NBI has been shown to help in DALM detection and to distinguish dysplastic from non-dysplastic mucosa in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
