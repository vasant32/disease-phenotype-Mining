<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the role of cationic amino acid transporter 2 (CAT2), the inducible transporter of L-Arg, in DSS <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression of CAT2 was upregulated in tissues from colitic mice and localized predominantly to colonic macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CAT2-deficient (CAT2-/-) mice exposed to DSS exhibited worsening of survival, body <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, colon weight, and histological injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These effects were associated with increased serum L-Arg and decreased tissue L-Arg uptake and inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical benefits of L-Arg supplementation in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice were lost in CAT2-/- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was increased infiltration of macrophages, dendritic cells, granulocytes, and T cells in colitic CAT2-/- compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cytokine profiling revealed increases in proinflammatory granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, macrophage inflammatory protein-1α, IL-15, and regulated and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T cell-expressed and -secreted and a shift from an IFN-γ- to an IL-17-predominant T cell response, as well as an increase in IL-13, in tissues from colitic CAT2-/- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there were no increases in other T helper cell type 2 cytokines, nor was there a global increase in macrophage-derived proinflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The increase in IL-17 derived from both CD4 and γδ T cells and was associated with colonic IL-6 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus CAT2 plays an important role in controlling <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and IL-17 activation in an injury model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, and impaired L-Arg availability may contribute to UC pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
