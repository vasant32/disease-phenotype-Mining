<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the influence of fish oil enriched enteral diet on intestinal tissues taken from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and non-inflamed non-IBD control patients in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Colonoscopic biopsies from patients with active CD (n = 4), active UC (n = 7), and non-inflamed non-IBD control patients (n = 4) were incubated (three dilutions of 1:20, 1:10, and 1:5) with Waymouth's culture medium and enteral elemental diet (EO28, SHS, Liverpool, UK) modified in the fatty acid composition with fish oil (EF) in an organ culture system for 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In each experimental set-up, incubation with Waymouth's medium alone as control was included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tissue viability was assessed by adding bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to the culture fluid and immunohistochemically staining for BrdU uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytokine ratio of IL-1ra/IL-1beta (low ratio indicative of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>) and production of those cytokines as a percentage of medium control were assayed in the culture supernatant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Incubation of CD-affected tissue with EF (1:20, 1:10, and 1:5) modestly and non-significantly increased IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio as compared with medium control (CD 39.1+/-16.1; 26.5+/-7.8, 47.1+/-16.8 vs control 13.0+/-2.2), but incubation of UC-affected tissues increased IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio significantly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three dilutions (UC 69.1+/-32.2, P&lt;0.05; 76.1+/-36.4, P = 0.05; 84.5+/-37.3, P&lt;0.02; vs control 10.2+/-3.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incubation of non-inflamed non-IBD control tissue did not increase the IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio in any dilution compared to medium control (69.3+/-47.0, 54.1+/-30.6, 79.4+/-34.0 vs control 76.1+/-37.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Average percentage production of IL-1beta indexed against medium control was significantly less in UC after EF incubation as compared with CD (UC 24.0+/-4.8 vs CD 51.8+/-8.1; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Average percentage production of IL-1ra was markedly higher in UC (135.9+/-3.4) than that in control patients (36.5+/-4.3) (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IBD tissues, after incubation with elemental diet modified in its fatty acid composition with fish oil, show an increase in IL-1ra/IL-1beta cytokine ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25681">omega-3 fatty acid</z:chebi> modulation is significantly more marked in UC compared with CD and is accompanied by both a reduction of IL-1beta and increase of IL-1ra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The positive direct anti-inflammatory effect of elemental diet with fish oil in tissue affected with UC suggests dietary treatment of UC may be possible </plain></SENT>
