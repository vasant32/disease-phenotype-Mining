<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate whether matrix metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9) or trypsinogens could serve as histological markers for an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive disease</z:e> course in pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified 24 patients with pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (â‰¤ 16 years) UC who had undergone surgery during childhood/adolescence a median of 2.1 years (range 0.1-7.4 years) after the diagnosis (between 1990 and 2008) in Children's Hospital, Helsinki, Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also identified 27 conservatively treated UC patients and matched them based on their age at the time of diagnosis and follow-up at a median of 6 years (range 3-11 years) to serve as disease controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty children for whom <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) had been excluded as a result of endoscopy served as non-IBD controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colon biopsies taken by diagnostic endoscopy before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of therapy were stained using immunohistochemistry to study the expression of MMP-9, trypsinogen-1 (Tryp-1), Tryp-2, and a trypsin inhibitor (TATI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The profiles of these proteases and inhibitor at diagnosis were compared between the surgery group, the conservatively treated UC patients and the non-IBD controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proportions of Tryp-1 and Tryp-2 positive samples in the colon epithelium and in the inflammatory cells of the colon stroma were comparable between the studied groups at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the immunopositivity of Tryp-1 (median 1; range 0-3) was significantly lower in the epithelium of the colon in the pediatric UC patients undergoing surgery when compared to that of the conservatively treated UC patients (median 2; range 0-3; P = 0.03) and non-IBD controls (median 2; range 0-3; P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For Tryp-2, there was no such difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the inflammatory cells of the colon stroma, the immunopositivities of Tryp-1 and Tryp-2 were comparable between the studied groups at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Also, the proportion of samples positive for TATI, as well as the immunopositivity, was comparable between the studied groups in the colon epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the stromal inflammatory cells of the colon, TATI was not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In UC patients, there were significantly more MMP-9 positive samples and a higher immunopositivity in the stromal inflammatory cells of the colon when compared to the samples from the non-IBD patients (P = 0.006 and P = 0.002, respectively); the immunopositivity correlated with the histological grade of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (95%CI: 0.22-0.62; P = 0.0002), but not with the other markers of active disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the immunopositivity or in the proportions of MMP-9 positive samples when examined by epithelial staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The staining profiles in the ileal biopsies were comparable between the studied groups for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the studied markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: For pediatric UC patients who require surgery, the immunopositivity of Tryp-1 at diagnosis is lower when compared to that of patients with a more benign disease course </plain></SENT>
