<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The relationship between motility and inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disorders</z:e> is at the same time complex and intriguing since these conditions might share some genetic, environmental, immunological and microbial predisposing factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, significant symptom overlapping may occur, muddling the waters within the clinical context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although on one hand this represents a challenge for the clinician for a potential under- or over-treatment and diagnostic delay, on the other hand it possibly represents an opportunity for the researcher to better disclose the intimate relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (often low-grade) <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221163" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">motor disorders</z:e> and deranged sensory function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The best example is probably represented by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In fact, a number of gastrointestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221163" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">motor disorders</z:e> have been described in association with these diseases, disorders which span from the esophagus to the anorectum, and which will be extensively covered in this review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is conceivable that at least part of this derangement is strictly related to inflammatory cytokine trafficking and neuromuscular changes; however, given the high prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0559031" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">functional gastrointestinal disorders</z:e> in the general population, this overlap might also be serendipitous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, it is worth noting that literature data on this topic are relatively scarce, sometimes quite outdated, and mostly focused on the interplay between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022104" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IBS">irritable bowel syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, both researchers and clinicians must be aware that symptoms related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854121" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal motility disorders</z:e> may be highly prevalent in both active and inactive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, correlate with greater psychological comorbidity and poorer quality of life, and may negatively influence the therapeutic approaches </plain></SENT>
