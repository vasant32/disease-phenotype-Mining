<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Equilibrium dialysis of the rectum in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> was used to determine whether cyclooxygenase and <z:mp ids='MP_0002524'>lipoxygenase products</z:mp> released from the inflamed rectal mucosa could be differentially inhibited by systemic treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 10 patients with severe disease <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leucotriene</z:chebi> B4 were markedly raised (p less than 0.05) on comparison with 10 healthy controls, and they decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) within 72 hours after administration of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> 1.5 mg/kg/day orally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi>, but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leucotriene</z:chebi> B4 concentrations decreased (p less than 0.05) within 72 hours after administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> 150 mg/day in another 10 patients with distal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These prompt reductions in concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> metabolites more likely are caused by direct drug actions, rather than being secondary to decreased tissue damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data accord with the theory explaining anti-inflammatory effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> through lipocortin activity and support the belief that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leucotrienes</z:chebi> are more important than <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandins</z:chebi> as mediators of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
