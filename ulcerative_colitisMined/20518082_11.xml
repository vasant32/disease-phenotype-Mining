<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> is highly variable between patients, and this has therapeutic implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A number of clinical features have been identified, which predict a mild or more severe outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, several of these are subjective and/or not persistent over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With the progress in genetics research in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD), genetic markers are increasingly being proposed to improve stratification of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genetics have the major advantage of being stable over time and not prone to subjective interpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, none of the genetic variants associated with particular outcomes have shown sufficient sensitivity or specificity to have been implemented in daily management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Along the same line of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233629" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">thinking</z:e>, pharmacogenetics or the study of association between variability in drug response and genetic variation has also received more attention as part of the endeavor for personalized medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ultimate goal in this area of medicine is to adapt medication to a patient's specific genetic background and therefore improve on efficacy and safety rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although pharmacogenetic studies have been performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> classes of drugs applied in IBD, few have generated consistent findings or have been replicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The only genetic test approved for clinical practice is <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> S-methyltransferase testing prior to starting treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> analogues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The other reported associations have suffered from lack of confirmation or still need replication efforts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the importance and necessity of pharmacogenetic studies will increase further as more therapeutic classes are being developed </plain></SENT>
