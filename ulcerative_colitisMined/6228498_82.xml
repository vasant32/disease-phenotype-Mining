<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Lymphocyte subpopulations in the intestinal mucosa of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> have been studied using a double marker immunofluorescence technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analysis of tissue sections revealed that the majority of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) were T cells (Hle-1+ HuTLA+ UCHT1+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, over 80% were of suppressor-cytotoxic phenotype (OKT8+:83 +/- 10.2%) with a small population of helper type IEL (OKT4+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only one third of OKT8+ IEL reacted with the T cell antibody, anti-Leu-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IEL were also Tac-, C3b-receptor- (C3RT05-), and Ig- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within the lamina propria, OKT4+ T cells predominated (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> 64 +/- 6.0%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> 63 +/- 6.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Less than half of the smaller OKT8+ population in the lamina propria was Leu-1+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These finding did not differ from those seen in histologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues from controls, and are similar to those reported in the small intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mononuclear cells were also isolated from the intestinal lamina propria using an enzymatic technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority of lymphocytes obtained were T cells (OKT3+), with populations of OKT4+ and OKT8+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the ratio of OKT4+ to OKT8+ lymphocytes determined by immunohistological analysis with that obtained in mucosal isolates, however, suggested that the isolation procedure may deplete OKT8+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that an imbalance of mucosal immunoregulatory T cells, as defined by monoclonal antibodies, does not occur in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>They also emphasize that functional studies of isolated intestinal mucosal cells should be combined with morphological studies of cell populations in situ </plain></SENT>
