<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A histopathological feature considered indicative of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) is the so-called basal lymphoid aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their relevance in the pathogenesis of UC is, however, unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have performed a comprehensive analysis of the immune cells in these aggregates most likely corresponding to the lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> also described in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009319" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">colitides</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Resection specimens of UC and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon were analysed by immunomorphometry, immunoflow cytometry, and immunoelectron microscopy, using a large panel of monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of UC, colonic lamina propria contained numerous basal aggregates composed of lymphocytes, follicular dendritic cells, and CD80/B7.1 positive dendritic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(2) CD4(+)CD28(-) alphabeta T cells and B cells were the dominant cell types in the aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(3) The aggregates contained a large fraction of cells that are normally associated with the epithelium: that is, gammadelta T cells (11 (7)%) and alpha(E)beta(7)(+) cells (26 (13)%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The gammadelta T cells used Vdelta1 and were CD4(-)CD8(-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunoelectron microscopy analysis demonstrated TcR-gammadelta internalisation and surface downregulation, indicating that the gammadelta T cells were activated and engaged in the disease process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(4) One third of cells in the aggregates expressed the antiapoptotic protein bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Basal lymphoid aggregates in UC colon are a consequence of anomalous lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo>, characterised by abnormal follicular architecture and unusual cell immunophenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The aggregates increase in size with severity of disease, and contain large numbers of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> resistant cells and activated mucosal gammadelta T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The latter probably colonise the aggregates as an immunoregulatory response to stressed lymphocytes or as a substitute for defective T helper cells in B cell activation. gammadelta T cells in the aggregates may be characteristic of UC </plain></SENT>
