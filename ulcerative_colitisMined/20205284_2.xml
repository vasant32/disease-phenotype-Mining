<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> colonoscopies in consecutive children who underwent their first diagnostic colonoscopy from Jan 2003 to 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-nine children (48 boys, 31 girls; mean age 9.2 +/- 4.2 years) were identified and reviewed with a total of 82 colonoscopies performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Successful caecal and ileal intubation rates were 97.6% and 75.6% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty patients (50.6%) had a positive diagnosis made in colonoscopy and that included <z:mp ids='MP_0003269'>colonic polyps</z:mp> (23), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (12), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (1), and miscellaneous causes (4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>80% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were in the rectosigmoid colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one were juvenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0004390'>hamartomatous polyps</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The exception was an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyp</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean ages for children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were 11.3 and 4.3 years respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no procedure-related complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Colonoscopy is a safe procedure in our Chinese children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The increasing diagnosis of IBD in recent decades may reflect a rising incidence of the disease in our children </plain></SENT>
