<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean annual incidence was significantly higher in European and American born (10.8/10(5)/year) than in Asian and African or Israeli born Jews </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The age adjusted prevalence rate in each population group was greater than the rates detected by earlier studies in other areas of the country (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence rate in the total population now approximates the moderate to high prevalence rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> found in many other localities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The particularly high rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in the European and American born population in Israel, in Jews residing in Western countries, and in certain non-Jewish populations in Great Britain and Northern Europe may imply the presence of a common aetiological mechanism </plain></SENT>
