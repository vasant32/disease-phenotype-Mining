<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the last years, the research community focused on the chance of improving the endoscopic screening to detect neoplastic lesions in a very early stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several studies proposed aberrant colonic crypt foci as the earliest recognizable step of transformation in colonic multiphase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We previously demonstrated the clinical applicability and predictive power of probe-based confocal laser endoscopy (pCLE) in superficial colorectal neoplastic lesions and also characterized in vivo a case of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-associated lesional mass (DALM) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Now, we aim to evaluate the accuracy of pCLE in the detection of ACF comparing in double-blind manner the microendoscopic and histopathological features resulting from colonic biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By pCLE, we identified specific crypt architecture modifications associated with changes in cellular infiltration and vessels architecture, highlighting a good correspondence between pCLE features and histology </plain></SENT>
