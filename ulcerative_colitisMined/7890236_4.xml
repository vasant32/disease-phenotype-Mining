<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Determination of the synthetic phase of the cell cycle is an accurate expression of inflammatory activity in the colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to find out if the proliferative index or the synthetic phase (S phase) of the colonic mucosa of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, as evaluated by DNA flow cytometry, is a reliable and reproducible marker of disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> of different degrees of activity were entered into the study and submitted to colonoscopy plus multiple rectal biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disease severity was defined for each patient by means of a clinical, endoscopic, and histological score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry was used to calculate the proliferative index and the S phase of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant correlation (p &lt; 0.001) was found between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> indices of severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that flow cytometric evaluation of the cell cycle in the rectal mucosa may be an efficient method of assessing severity of disease and efficacy of medical treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
