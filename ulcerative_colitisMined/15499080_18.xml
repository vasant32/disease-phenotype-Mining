<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TLR expression and activation of TLR-mediated signaling pathways in primary CEC of healthy animals was compared with CEC in IL-2(-/-) mice during the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In healthy animals, CEC expressed functional TLR, and in response to the TLR4 ligand LPS, proliferated and secreted the cytokines IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the TLR-responsiveness of CEC in IL-2(-/-) mice was different with decreased TLR4 responsiveness and augmented TLR2 responses that result in IL-6 and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TLR signaling in CEC did not involve NF-kappaB (p65) activation with the inhibitory p50 form of NF-kappaB predominating in CEC in both the healthy and inflamed colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> was, however, associated with the activation of MAPK family members and upregulation of MyD88-independent signaling pathways characterized by increased caspase-1 activity and IL-18 production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings identify changes in TLR expression and signaling during the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> that may contribute to changes in the host response to <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> antigens seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
