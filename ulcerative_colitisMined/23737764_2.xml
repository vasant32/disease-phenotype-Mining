<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mucus layer in the gastrointestinal tract plays important role in host innate defense, regulation of secretion, and absorption processes, maintaining colonization resistance, which composes the integrity of protective mucus barrier in the large intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Investigations of mucin expression in the colon mucosa can improve the understanding of protective function of mucosal barrier in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>77 patients with UC and CD were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological analysis of colon mucosa was done by standard method (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin, alcian blue at pH 1.0 and 2.5 to determine sulfated and nonsulfated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycans</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi>, and goblet cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To characterize the mucus production the <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>-reaction was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was performed using monoclonal mouse antibodies raised against MUC2, MUC3, MUC4, and TFF3 (USBiological, USA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The moderate expression of MUC2 and MUC3 (50.0% and 32.1%, P = 0.03) and high expression of MUC4 and TFF3 in the colon mucosa were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The intensive labeling of MUC4 and TFF3 occurred more often (42.9% and 57.1%, P = 0.03) in patients with CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The level of expression of secretory MUC2 and transmembrane MUC3 and MUC4 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with UC was low, up to its complete absence (59.2% and 53.1% cases, P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>TFF3 expression had high and medium staining intensity in patients with UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Different types of mucins synthesis, secretion, and expression were found in patients with UC and CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The expression of mucin MUC2, MUC3, MUC4, and TFF3 correlated with the activity of disease and the extent of the inflammatory process in the large intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The most pronounced alteration of mucins expression was observed in patients with severe UC and CD </plain></SENT>
