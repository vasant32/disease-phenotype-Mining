<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Clear strategies to optimise the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: A meta-analysis was undertaken to examine critically the role of rectal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> in the management of active distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> reported randomised controlled trials were retrieved by searching the Medline and EMBASE databases and the bibliographies of relevant studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Trials which met inclusion criteria were assessed for scientific rigour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were extracted by two independent observers according to predetermined criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 83 trials retrieved, 33 met inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pooled odds ratios (POR) showed conventional rectal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and rectal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3207">budesonide</z:chebi> to be clearly superior to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In seven trials, rectal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>) was significantly better than conventional rectal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> for inducing remission of symptoms, endoscopy, and histology with POR of 2.42 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.72-3.41), 1.89 (95% CI 1.29-2.76), and 2.03 (95% CI 1.28-3.20), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rectal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3207">budesonide</z:chebi> was of comparable efficacy to conventional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> but produced less endogenous <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Side effects, although inconsistently reported, were generally minor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A cost comparison of rectal preparations showed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> to be less expensive than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Rectal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> is superior to rectal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> in the management of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
