<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the influence of colectomy on antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi>) positivity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In small series of patients it has been suggested that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> positivity in UC might be predictive for development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> after colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To assess the prevalence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> in UC patients treated by colectomy and a Brooke's ileostomy (UC-BI) or ileal pouch anal anastomosis (UC-IPAA), and the relation between the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi>, the type of surgery, and the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: 63 UC patients treated by colectomy (32 with UC-BI and 31 with UC-IPAA), 54 UC, and 24 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Samples were obtained at least two years after colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> were detected by indirect immunofluorescent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no differences between patients with (36.3%) or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> (35.0%) and between patients with UC (55%), UC-BI (40.6%), and UC-IPAA (35.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> prevalence significantly decreases in the whole group of operated patients (38.0%) compared with non-operated UC (p = 0.044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> in operated patients was significantly lower than in non-operated UC, suggesting that it might be related either to the presence of inflamed or diseased tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> persistence is not related to the surgical procedure and it should not be used as a marker for predicting the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
