<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic-risk polymorphisms explain less than one third of the heritability of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Epidemiologic and laboratory data suggest that environmental factors play a significant role in influencing the risk and natural history of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Smoking is the most widely and consistently described risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It, however, increases the risk of CD while conferring protection against UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The gut microbiome is a key component in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several external factors potentially exert an effect by influencing the composition of the gut microbiome or disrupting the intestinal barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These external influences include the use of antibiotics or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> and the presence of enteric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Data on diet have been inconsistent, but high fiber intake, particularly of soluble fiber, appears to protect against CD, whereas protein intake may increase disease risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">Vitamin D</z:chebi> may also play an important protective role, particularly in patients with CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neurobehavioral factors, such as stress and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, also influence the risk of IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Systematic and rigorous studies of environmental exposures in the management of IBD are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In particular, studies of whether environmental factors can be modified to reduce the likelihood of relapse or improve patient outcomes would be valuable </plain></SENT>
