<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some of these cases appear to be of atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, whilst the others resemble <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The high incidence of Jewish people in this series suggests a racial tendency towards this distribution of the inflammatory change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The right-sided nature of the lesion has led to unnecessarily prolonged medical treatment, to right hemicolectomy, and to ileorectal anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of such procedures have been disappointing, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the more so because the rectum was almost <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and hence would seem ideally suited for ileorectal anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These patients have progressed very well with ileostomy </plain></SENT>
