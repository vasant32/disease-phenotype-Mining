<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> composition was 12.5 +/- 1.4 mol % (mean +/- 2 SEM) in the inflamed colonic mucosa from the patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 6.8 +/- 1.2 mol % in the intact mucosa from healthy controls (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the inflamed colonic mucosa, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28716">palmitoleic acid</z:chebi> were concomitantly decreased (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.02, respectively), while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">docosahexaenoic acid</z:chebi> was increased (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histopathological examination showed that there was a three fold increase in the cell density of inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria of the inflamed colonic mucosa (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cell density of inflammatory infiltrate correlated with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> composition of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> in colonic mucosa (r = 0.89, p less than 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> alters the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15904">long chain fatty acid</z:chebi> composition of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> in colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The observed increase in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> composition of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> in inflamed colonic mucosa may contribute to the enhanced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> metabolism in patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
