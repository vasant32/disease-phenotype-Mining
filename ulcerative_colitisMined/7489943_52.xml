<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) is a key hormone in integrated response to stress, acting as the major regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, local production of CRH has been detected in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human colonic enterochromaffin cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CRH is locally secreted in granulomatous and arthritic tissues in rats and humans, where it seems to act as a local proinflammatory agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To find out if CRH is present in colonic tissues of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, this study examined the expression of this <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> in the large bowel of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colonic tissues of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> obtained by endoscopic biopsy were immunostained with anti-CRH antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CRH messenger (m) <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was also examined in biopsy specimens of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> by the reverse transcribed polymerase chain reaction method and by in situ hybridisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Considerably enhanced expression of immunoreactive CRH was found in mucosal inflammatory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intense staining with anti-CRH antibody was also shown in mucosal macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CRH <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was expressed in mucosal epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression of immunoreactive CRH in colonic mucosal epithelial cells of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> slightly increased, but not significantly, compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosal epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that CRH may play a part in the modulation of intestinal immune and inflammatory system, and as a modulator in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
