<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate intensity, localization and cofactors of pain in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients in connection with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed and analyzed the responses of 334 patients to a specifically designed questionnaire based on the short <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> questionnaire (SIBDQ) and the German pain questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pain intensity, HRQOL, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> activity index (CDAI) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> activity index (CAI) were correlated and verified on a visual analog scale (VAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 87.9% of patients reported pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Females and males reported comparable pain intensities and HRQOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgery reduced pain in both genders (P = 0.023), whereas HRQOL only improved in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, patients on <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesics</z:chebi> reported more pain (P = 0.003) and lower HRQOL (P = 0.039) than patients not on <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was found in UC patients between pain intensity and HRQOL (P = 0.023) and CAI (P = 0.027), and in CD patients between HRQOL and CDAI (P = 0.0001), but not between pain intensity and CDAI (P = 0.35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between patients with low CDAI scores and pain intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Most IBD patients suffer from pain and have decreased HRQOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study reinforces the need for effective individualized pain therapy in IBD patients </plain></SENT>
