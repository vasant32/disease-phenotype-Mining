<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of IgA class reticulin and endomysium antibodies was examined with the standard immunofluorescence method in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coeliac disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>dermatitis</z:hpo> herpetiformis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Similar high antibody frequencies were detected in 32 untreated adults (91%) and 18 children (100%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coeliac disease</z:e> and in 14 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>dermatitis</z:hpo> herpetiformis patients with subtotal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011473'>villous atrophy</z:hpo> (reticulin antibodies 93% and endomysium antibodies 100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The specificity of IgA class reticulin antibodies and endomysium antibodies was high because <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 45 adult patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 24 non-coeliac children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011458'>abdominal symptoms</z:hpo> and 99/100 healthy blood donors were negative for these antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The only positive blood donor had both IgA class reticulin antibodies and endomysium antibodies but also she was found to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coeliac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IgA class reticulin antibodies and endomysium antibodies declined in parallel during treatment with a gluten free diet and increased on gluten challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This suggests that these antibodies can be used to screen for gluten sensitive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002242'>enteropathy</z:hpo> and to monitor dietary treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To characterise the tissue specificity of reticulin antibodies and endomysium antibodies four positive sera were absorbed with human and several rodent liver homogenates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Absorption with rat or other rodent livers removed the rodent-specific reticulin antibodies but not the reticulin antibodies detectable with human tissues or the endomysium antibodies detectable with monkey oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results show that reticulin antibodies can be divided into the rat and human subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The human subtype could not be separated from endomysium antibodies in the present absorption experiments </plain></SENT>
