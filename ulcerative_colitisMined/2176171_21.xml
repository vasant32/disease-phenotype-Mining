<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Serum anticolon antibody and in vitro anti-colon antibody production by peripheral blood and mucosal lymphocytes was investigated in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency of serum anticolon antibody was 71% in 41 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, estimated by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using isolated rat colon epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This finding confirms our previous report on the frequency of serum anticolon antibody detected by flow cytometry analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The estimated frequencies of IgG anticolon antibody secreting cells were 1.5-12.5/10(6) cells in the colonic mucosa and 0.1-0.5/10(6) cells in peripheral blood, from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> when Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was used as a B cell polyclonal activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Poisson analysis of limiting dilution culture showed that about one per 140 IgG cells in the colonic mucosa synthesised anticolon antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two monoclonal IgG antibodies were obtained from EBV transformed anticolon antibody secreting cells by limiting dilution method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One reacted with goblet cells in the intestine, and the other reacted mainly with colonic epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> anticolon antibodies are present in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and that colonic mucosa may be the main source of anticolon antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Local autoimmune reaction might have an important role in causing the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of colonic mucosa in this disease </plain></SENT>
