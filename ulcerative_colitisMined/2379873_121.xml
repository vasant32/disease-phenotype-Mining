<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> it proved to be a dominant mediator and a reliable marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine in vitro the extent of production and release of interleukin 1 from colonic mucosa of patients with active untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Colonic mucosal biopsy specimens were obtained during colonoscopy from 17 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> of the colon, and 16 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interleukin 1 content was determined in fresh and 24 hour organ cultured mucosa as well as in cultured medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interleukin 1 content and release were significantly higher in the inflamed mucosa compared with that of control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">Prednisolone</z:chebi> inhibited interleukin 1 release in a dose dependent fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that colonic mucosal interleukin 1 content and production is significantly raised in active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> and may have a role in the pathogenesis of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological suppression of tissue interleukin 1 production may have a beneficial therapeutic effect </plain></SENT>
