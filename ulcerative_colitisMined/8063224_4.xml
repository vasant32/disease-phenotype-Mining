<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the aetiology remains unknown, it has been suggested that the immune system of these patients is implicated in the pathogenesis of their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T cell function was investigated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients and defective phytohaemagglutinin induced T cell mitogenesis was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The DNA synthesis induced by stimulation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol esters</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">ionophore</z:chebi> (ionomycin), however, was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These changes cannot be ascribed to either decreased interleukin 2 synthesis or to a defective interleukin 2 receptor expression after cellular activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this defective proliferative response of the T lymphocytes was observed even in the presence of saturated concentrations of exogenous interleukin 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results emphasise that the interleukin 2 dependent proliferation pathway is deficient in T lymphocytes from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
