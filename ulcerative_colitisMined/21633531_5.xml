<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study intestinal permeability (IP) and its relationship to the disease activity in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> (IBD) - <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-eight patients with active IBD (32 with CD and 26 with UC) and 25 healthy controls consented to participate in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical activity of CD was estimated using the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's Disease</z:hpo> Activity Index (CDAI), and the endoscopic activity of UC using the Mayo scoring system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IP was assessed by the rise in levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31709">iohexol</z:chebi>, which was administered orally (25 mL, 350 mg/mL) 2 h after breakfast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three and six hours later serum (SIC mg/L) and urine (UIC g/mol) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31709">iohexol</z:chebi> concentrations were determined by a validated HPLC-UV technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the CD group, SIC values at 3 h (2.95 ± 2.11 mg/L) and at 6 h after ingestion (2.63 ± 2.18 mg/L) were significantly higher compared to those of healthy subjects (1.25 ± 1.40 mg/L and 1.11 ± 1.10 mg/L, respectively, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>UIC (g/mol) values were also higher in patients, but the differences were significant only for UIC at 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant positive correlation (P &lt; 0.05) was found between the CDAI and IP, assessed by SIC at 3 h (r = 0.60) and 6 h (r = 0.74) after the ingestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In comparison to controls, SIC and UIC of UC patients were higher in the two studied periods, but the differences were significant at 6 h only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher values of SIC (P &lt; 0.05) were found in patients with severe endoscopic activity of UC compared to those of patients with mild and moderate activity (3.68 ± 3.18 vs 0.92 ± 0.69 mg/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Serum levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31709">iohexol</z:chebi> at 3 h and 6 h after its ingestion reflect increased IP, which is related to the disease activity in patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
