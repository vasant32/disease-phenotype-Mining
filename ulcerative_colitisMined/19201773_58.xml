<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The IL2/IL21 locus on 4q27 is known to be a common risk locus for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> (shown in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coeliac disease</z:e>, type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo>), while the roles that interleukin 2 (IL2) and IL21 play in the immune response also make them attractive candidates for IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to test for association between the IL2/IL21 locus and the IBDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL2/IL21 locus most associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coeliac disease</z:e> were genotyped in 1590 subjects with IBD and 929 controls from The Netherlands, and then replicated in a North American cohort (2387 cases and 1266 controls) and an Italian cohort (805 cases and 421 controls), yielding a total of 4782 cases (3194 UC, 1588 CD) and 2616 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Allelic association testing and a pooled analysis using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four SNPs were strongly associated with UC in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cohorts and reached genome-wide significance in the pooled analysis (rs13151961 p = 1.35 x 10(-10), rs13119723 p = 8.60 x 10(-8), rs6840978 p = 3.0 7x 10(-8), rs6822844 p = 2.77 x 10(-9)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A moderate association with CD was also found in the pooled analysis (p value range 0.0016-9.86 x 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A strong association for the IL2/IL21 locus with UC was found, which also confirms it as a general susceptibility locus for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
