<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endoscopic surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100281'>chronic colitis</z:hpo> uses random biopsies to find dysplastic fields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Enhanced endoscopic methods are more sensitive for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> detection, but their specificity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To develop a mathematical model of the sensitivity of random biopsy surveillance, and determine the implications of negative, a single positive, or multiple positive biopsies for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and compare the detection threshold to that detectable by enhanced endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using mathematical modelling, we calculated the confidence level with which <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> can be excluded, the dysplastic field size detection threshold, the predicted area of a dysplastic field, and the number of biopsies needed for a given <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> detection threshold and confidence level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 32 random biopsies provide only 80% confidence that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> involving &gt; or =5% of the colon can be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When a single biopsy of 18 is dysplastic, this predicts a dysplastic area (89 cm(2)) several orders of magnitude greater than dysplastic fields that are readily detectable by enhanced endoscopy (1 cm diameter), and the predicted field size increases rapidly with multiple positive biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Random biopsy surveillance is sufficiently sensitive to detect large dysplastic fields with significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Enhanced endoscopy can detect much smaller dysplastic fields, but these have unknown (perhaps much lower) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Small dysplastic fields should not be assumed to indicate a high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk that warrants colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies are needed to define the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk and optimal management of small dysplastic lesions </plain></SENT>
