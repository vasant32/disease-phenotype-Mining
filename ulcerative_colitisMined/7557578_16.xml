<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty five patients with either <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> were followed up during a longterm study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 16 patients who become acutely ill with either <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> had significantly higher concentrations of sTNF-R p55 and p75 in their urine compared with those who were in remission, or those who were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between increased concentrations (&gt; 20 ng/ml) of both sTNF-R p55 and p75 in the urine and a high <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> activity index (CDAI) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> activity index (CAI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, determination of sTNF-R is a good non-invasive parameter that can be used to assess the activity of disease and the efficacy of treatment </plain></SENT>
