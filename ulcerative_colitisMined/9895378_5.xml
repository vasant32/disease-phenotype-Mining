<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To examine the anti-colon antibody response using human colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines as antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0810319" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">other gastrointestinal disorders</z:e> and healthy controls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Comparative enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were performed to assess the value of whole Caco-2, HT-29, and LS-180 cells as antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The antigenic determinants of the immune response were characterised by western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sera demonstrated immunoreactivity against each of the cell lines, but different <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> were recognised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Applying whole Caco-2 cells as antigen in an ELISA, the prevalence of anti-colon antibodies was significantly greater in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (36%) than <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (13%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0810319" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">other gastrointestinal disorders</z:e> (13%) and healthy controls (0) (p&lt;0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The immune response was not associated with one predominant antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fixed whole cell ELISA is a simple and feasible method for studying the anti-colon antibody response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This response is non-specific, being directed against multiple antigens, and is likely to be an epiphenomenon of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, more so for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> than <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
