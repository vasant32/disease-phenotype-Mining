<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The mucosa in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) is replete with antibody producing plasma B cells and polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This combination of effector cells requires a crosslinking antigen to evoke an antibody driven PMN <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> via their Fc receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The stimulus for activation is thought to be commensal bacteria colonising the gut mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this investigation was to compare the principal culturable <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> populations on the rectal mucosa of UC patients, and to determine whether specific antibodies towards these bacteria can activate infiltrating PMN through opsonisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This would provide an explanation for this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Bacteria colonising rectal tissue were characterised using chemotaxonomic techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Systemic antibody responses were measured against total antigens and surface antigens of these organisms in UC and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) patients, together with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antibody enhancement of the respiratory burst in PMN was also investigated, against a range of mucosal isolates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Distinct differences were observed in some <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> populations in UC biopsies, which were generally reflected in antibody responses towards these organisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>UC patients had higher IgG responses to surface antigens, primarily IgG1, whereas the response in CD was mainly IgG2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Antibodies from UC patients greatly enhanced the respiratory burst in PMN, in response to individual <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Changes in mucosal bacteria, and a switch from internal to surface antigen/antibody reactivity of a predominantly IgG1 type, leads to greater opsonisation of the respiratory burst in PMN, providing a mechanism for maintaining the inflammatory state in UC </plain></SENT>
