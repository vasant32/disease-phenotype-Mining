<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-nine patients with IBD and 30 healthy controls were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The concentration of sICAM-1 was detected with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16004">D-lactate</z:chebi> and DAO was measured by spectroscopic analysis, and the number of white blood cells (WBC) was determined by routine procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The levels of sICAM-l, DAO, and WBC in IBD patients were significantly higher than those in the control group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>sICAM-l in IBD patients was found to be closely related to the levels of DAO and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16004">D-lactate</z:chebi> (212.94 +/- 69.89 vs 6.35 +/- 2.35, P = 0.000), DAO 212.94 +/- 69.89 vs 8.65 +/- 3.54, P = 0.000) and WBC (212.94 +/- 69.89 vs 7.40 +/- 2.61, P = 0.000), but no significant difference was observed between patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The post-treatment levels of sICAM-l, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16004">D-lactate</z:chebi> and WBC were significantly lower than before treatment (sICAM-l 206.57 +/- 79.21 vs 146.21 +/- 64.43, P = 0.000), (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16004">D-lactate</z:chebi> 1.46 +/- 0.94 vs 0.52 +/- 0.32, P = 0.000) and (WBC 7.24 +/- 0.2.33 vs 5.21 +/- 3.21, P = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: sICAM-1, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16004">D-lactate</z:chebi> and DAO are closely related to the specific conditions of IBD, and thus could be used as a major diagnostic index </plain></SENT>
