<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A dose-ranging effect was detected in the per protocol analysis, with remission rates of 60% (0.5 g), 70% (1.0 g), and 78% (2.0 g) (p = 0.03, trend in proportions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The higher dose was most effective in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> (90% remission on 2 g/day, p = 0.03) or those in remission for less than 12 months before the trial (88% remission on 2 g/day, p = 0.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was little dose-ranging effect in patients with extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> or those in remission for more than 12 months </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The optimal dose of olsalazine for maintaining remission in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> is 1 g/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> or recent relapse, 2 g/day may be preferable, although the dose seems to be less important in patients with more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849867" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">extensive disease</z:e> or those in long term remission </plain></SENT>
