<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that Th17 cells, which are well known as key mediators of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, have a pivotal role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and development of IBD in humans and mice, alike </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In recent years, it has been reported that IL-27, which is an IL-12-related heterodimeric cytokine consisting of EBI3 and p28 subunits, act directly on naive T cells to suppress the differentiation of Th17 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, effects of exogenous IL-27 on the IBD are not well elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To clarify the suppressive effect of IL-27 treatment on IBD, we applied the flexible linking method to EBI3 and p28 subunits and generated a single-chain human IL-27 (scIL-27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>scIL-27 inhibited xenogenic mouse Th17 cell differentiation in vitro, indicating that scIL-27 also acts in mouse immune systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a 2,4,6-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48110">trinitrobenzene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29214">sulfonic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi>)-induced mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0100282'>acute colitis</z:hpo> model, subcutaneous scIL-27 treatment significantly improved the colon length, extent of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, and ulceration and thickened epithelium and several pathological scores in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>scIL-27 clearly suppressed several inflammatory cytokines, including IL-17, in inflamed colon, except for anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mesenteric lymph node cells from scIL-27-treated mice also exhibited a <z:mp ids='MP_0001876'>reduced inflammatory response</z:mp> and, furthermore, a lower population of Th17 cells than those of PBS-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, we showed the therapeutic efficacy of scIL-27 on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> even after active <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest new possible therapeutic approaches for IBD, including disorders such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
