<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Laboratory markers have been investigated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) for diagnostic and differential diagnostic purposes, for assessment of disease activity and risk of complications, for prediction of relapse, and for monitoring the effect of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The introduction of biological therapies in IBD has renewed interest in inflammatory markers (especially C reactive protein (CRP)), given their potential to select responders to these treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the laboratory markers, CRP is the most studied and has been shown to have the best overall performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CRP is an objective marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and correlates well with disease activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increased CRP levels are associated with better response rates and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CRP levels predict high placebo response rates in clinical trials with biologicals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, despite the advantages of CRP over other markers, it is still far from ideal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, CRP correlates less well with disease activity in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) as compared with CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other laboratory markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), leucocyte and platelet count, albumin, and 1 acid <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (orosomucoid), have been studied either less extensively in IBD or have proven to be less useful than CRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Faecal markers seem promising and may be more specific in detecting gut <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in patients with established IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Promising results have been reported with the use of faecal calprotectin in CD as well as in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recent data however suggest that the performance of the faecal calprotectin test is superior for UC than for CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Taken together, laboratory markers are useful and should be part of the global management of our IBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>They are however not magic and until more data become available, the use of CRP and other laboratory markers should be seen as an additive tool to clinical observation and physical examination rather than a replacement </plain></SENT>
