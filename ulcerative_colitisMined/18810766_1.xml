<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mortality related to severe attacks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> has decreased dramatically, to less than 1%, in experienced centers, due to the appropriate use of intensive therapeutic measures (intravenous steroids, fluids and electrolytes, artificial nutritional support, antibiotics, etc), along with timely decision-making about second-line medical therapy and early identification of patients requiring colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One of the most difficult decisions in the management of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> is knowing for how long <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> should be administered before deciding that a patient is a non-responder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studies assessing the outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> attacks after steroid initiation have demonstrated that, in steroid-sensitive patients, the response generally occurs early on, in the first days of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Different indexes to predict treatment failure, when applied on the third day of treatment, have demonstrated a high positive predictive value for colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to this resolute approach, which is the most widely accepted, other authors have suggested that in some patients a complete and prolonged response to steroids may take longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Either way, physicians taking care of these patients need to recognize that severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> may be life-threatening, and they need to be careful with excessively prolonged medical treatment and delayed surgery </plain></SENT>
