<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-eight patients with mildly and moderately active UC were recruited, 106 patients in 1993-1995, and 122 patients in 2000-2002, they were assigned as the 1990s group (n = 106) and the 2000s group (n = 122), prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The general characteristics, clinical manifestations, colonoscopic and histological data were compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The short-term efficacy and safety of SASP 3 g per d were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 2000s and 1990s groups, the gender ratio of men to women was 1:1.18 and 1:1.04, 57.4% and 50.9% of the patients were between 30 and 49 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The gender ratio and age of UC patients were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total course of 50.0% and 37.1% of UC patients was less than 1 year (P&lt;0.05), 10.6% and 31.2% of the cases had a duration of more than 5 years (P&lt;0.05) in 2000s and 1990s groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common clinical type was first episode in 2000s group and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> relapse in 1990s group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients showed a higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> and tenderness in 1990s group than in 2000s group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>Erosions</z:mpath> were found in 84.4% and 67.9% of patients in 2000s and 1990s groups (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rough and granular mucosa (67.9% vs 43.4%, P&lt;0.05) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (47.2% vs 32.8%, P&lt;0.05) were identified in 1990s group more than in 2000s group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in clinical, colonoscopic and histological classifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After SASP (1 g thrice per d) treatment for 6 wk, the clinical, colonoscopic and histological remission rates were 71.8%, 21.8% and 16.4%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In 79 patients with clinical remission, 58.2% and 67.1% remained grade 1 in colonoscopic and histological findings, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The overall effects in first episode type (complete remission in 10, 18.9%, partial remission in 28, 52.8%, and improvement in 9, 17.0%) were better than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> relapse type (complete remission in 3, 7.5%; partial remission in 16, 40.0%; and improvement in 15, 37.5%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> persistent type (complete remission in 1, 5.9%; partial remission in 6, 35.3%; and improvement in 6, 35.3%) respectively (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In 110 patients treated with SASP, 18 patients (16.4%) had adverse reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Except for two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo> and one case of WBC decrease, none of the patients had to stop the treatment because of severe adverse reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with mildly and moderately active UC in 2000s group had a shorter disease course, milder clinical manifestations, more first episode type and higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> mucosal lesions in colonoscopy than in 1990s group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The patients in 1990s group had higher proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> relapse type and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> mucosal change in colonoscopy than in 2000s group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The short-term efficacy of SASP could be mainly remission of clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>But more than half of the patients still had light <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in colonoscopy and histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The overall effects of SASP in first episode type were better than those in other types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>SASP was a safe and effective drug to treat mildly and moderately active UC </plain></SENT>
