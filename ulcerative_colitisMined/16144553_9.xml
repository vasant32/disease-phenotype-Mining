<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to identify a possible association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> and UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-two patients with both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> and UC received treatment with functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical symptom scores for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> and UC, as well as serum levels of anti-Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) were evaluated at week 0 and week 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sinus wash fluid SEB content was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The surgically removed tissues were cultured to identify growth of Staphylococcus. aureus (S. aureus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was employed to identify anti-SEB positive cells in the colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Colonic biopsies were obtained and incubated with SEB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mast cell activation in the colonic mucosa in response to incubation with SEB was observed with electron microscopy and immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The clinical symptom scores of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> and UC severe scores (UCSS) were significantly reduced in the UC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> patients after FESS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The number of cultured S. aureus colonies from the surgically removed sinus mucosa significantly correlated with the decrease in UCSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>High levels of SEB were detected in the sinus wash fluids of the patients with UC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">Histamine</z:chebi> and tryptase release was significantly higher in the culture supernate in the patients with UC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> than the patients with UC-only and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Anti-SEB positive cells were located in the colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The pathogenesis of UC in some patients may be associated with their pre-existing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> by a mechanism of swallowing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo>-derived SEB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We speculate that SEB initiates inappropriate immune reactions and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the colonic mucosa that further progresses to UC </plain></SENT>
