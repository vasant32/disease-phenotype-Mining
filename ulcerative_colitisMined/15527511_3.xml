<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-seven patients, 17 with Crohn and 10 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> submitted to surgery were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were obtained before surgery from a peripheral vein and during surgery from the mesenteric vein draining the affected intestinal segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen healthy age and sex matched subjects were studied to determine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range for peripheral PIIIP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In IBD patients peripheral PIIIP level was significantly higher if compared with controls (5.0 +/- 1.9 vs 2.7 +/- 0.7 microg/l; p = 0.0001); splanchnic PIIIP level was 5.5 +/- 2.6 microg/l showing a positive gradient between splanchnic and peripheral concentrations of PIIIP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant differences between groups nor correlations with patients' age and duration of disease were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that the increased local collagen metabolism in active IBD is reflected also in the systemic circulation irrespective of the history of the disease, suggesting that PIIIP should be considered more appropiately as a marker of the activity phases of IBD </plain></SENT>
