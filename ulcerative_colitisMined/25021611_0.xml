<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight loss</z:hpo> is a recognised presenting feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Inflammatory Bowel Disease</z:e> (IBD) and considered as marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo> and disease severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is well established in children with IBD, however in adults, evidence based data is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is little in the literature characterising <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> prior to formal diagnosis, or defining the disease factors associated with it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with IBD attending outpatient clinic were provided with a questionnaire enquiring into various aspects of their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Percentage Body Mass Index loss prior to diagnosis was calculated for each subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were sub-categorised into groups according to severity of % BMI loss (insignificant &lt;5%, moderate 5-10%, severe 10-20%, extreme &gt;20%), and disease and patient factors associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 494 subjects were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>237 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's Disease</z:hpo> (CD); 257 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative Colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean%BMI loss prior to diagnosis was greater in CD (CD 9.76% vs UC 7.63, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increasing age at diagnosis was inversely associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> prior to diagnosis in UC (-0.1 per year of age, 95% CI -0.17 - -0.03, p = 0.004), and CD (-0.15 per year of age, 95% CI -0.23 - -0.06, p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In CD, patients with prior appendectomy had reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (HR 0.38, p = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ileal disease</z:e> was a risk factor in patients with extreme <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight loss</z:hpo> is a significant problem for many IBD patients at presentation, especially in younger age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> with ileal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Improved awareness of the presenting features of IBD should encourage wider use of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo> screening tools and earlier investigative tests to uncover patients at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Appendectomy confers a protective effect in CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>DISCLOSURE OF INTEREST: None Declared </plain></SENT>
