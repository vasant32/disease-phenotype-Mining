<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent epidemiological data show that its incidence and prevalence are increasing in many parts of the world, in parallel with altered lifestyles, improved access to health, improved sanitation and industrialisation rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Current therapeutic strategies for treating UC have only been moderately successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite major recent advances in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> therapeutic resources, a considerable proportion of patients are still refractory to conventional treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Less than half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients achieve long-term remission, many require colectomy, and the disease still has a major impact on patients' lives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, recent data point to slightly raised mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While these outcomes could be partly improved by optimising current therapeutic strategies, they clearly highlight the need to develop new therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Currently, a number of promising and innovative therapeutic approaches are being explored, some of which will hopefully survive to reach the clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Until such a time arrives, it is important that a better understanding of the clinical particularities of the disease, an improved knowledge of the host-microbiome negative interactions and of the environmental factors beyond disease development is achieved to obtain the final and desired outcome: to provide better treatment and quality of life for patients with this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596452" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disabling disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
