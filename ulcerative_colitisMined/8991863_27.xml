<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty patients received either a duplicated (J) or a quadruplicated (W) reservoir, constructed with either 30 or 40 cm of ileum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each patient underwent laboratory tests of anorectal function before and one year after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One year after operation, 57 patients were available for assessment: each had good anal continence, though eight experienced minor leakage of mucus, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were able to defer defecation for more than 15 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median bowel frequency in 24 hours (IQR) in patients with J reservoirs (5 (4-7)) did not differ significantly from that of patients with W reservoirs (5 (4-6)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Likewise, bowel frequency in patients with the smaller (30 cm) reservoirs did not differ significantly from bowel frequency in patients with the larger (40 cm) reservoirs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, patients with large W40 reservoirs had the lowest bowel frequency of the four groups (median 4 per 24 hours, p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The capacity and compliance of the W40 reservoirs were greater than those of the other types of reservoir, but the differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide support for the use of a relatively small (30 cm), duplicated (J) ileal reservoir, which is simple to construct with linear stapling instruments </plain></SENT>
