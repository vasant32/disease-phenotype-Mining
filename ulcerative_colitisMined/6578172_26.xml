<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> increased synthesis of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> (PG)E2 was observed when the mucosa was inflamed, compared with uninflamed mucosa in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, and with control biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> differences from control specimens were observed even in the absence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a raised synthesis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> (Tx)B2 (stable breakdown product of TxA2); concentrations of 6-keto <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi> (stable breakdown product of prostacyclin) were unchanged and hence the ratio of 6-keto <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi>/TxB2 was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These changes might lead to an altered cytoprotective capacity or reduced suppressor cell activity, such as has previously been reported in intestinal lymphocytes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
