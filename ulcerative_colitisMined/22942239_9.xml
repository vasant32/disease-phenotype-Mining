<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent data show that IL-13 may play an important role in a novel innate immune response since it can be released by signals from an injured or inflamed epithelium, of particular relevance to the gut </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animal models of IL-13-driven <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and EO) are being translated to human disease and providing insight into potential strategies for new therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In fact, multiple clinical trials using anti-IL-13 drugs are underway in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> and are being extended to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review presents the current knowledge on IL-13 production and function in the gut, including the cells and receptor signalling pathways involved in mediating IL-13 effects, the proposed mechanisms of IL-13 induced gut disease and the many drugs currently being tested that target IL-13 related pathways </plain></SENT>
