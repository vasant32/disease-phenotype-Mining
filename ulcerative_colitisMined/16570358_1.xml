<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the role of cryofibrinogen (CF) in active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CF was assayed in 284 subjects: 61 with active and 63 with inactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), 45 who had proctocolectomy, 35 with active and 20 with inactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), 40 with other diseases and 20 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Trypsin inhibitor (TI) and TI antibody (TI-Ab) were measured in plasma and CF complex by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CF in active UC was strikingly high compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups (c2&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, CF was significantly higher in active CD than in inactive CD or in controls (c2&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In UC, high CF and TI-Ab were associated with the need for operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, high CF, CF/fibrinogen ratio, low TI and high TI-Ab in plasma were associated with disease activity or refractoriness to medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elevated CF was not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> reactants like C-reactive protein and white blood cell counts except for erythrocyte sedimentation rate, suggesting that elevated CF was not a consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Elevated CF in active IBD appears to be morbigenous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CF promotes IBD via two main mechanisms, quenching of TI (an anti-inflammatory substance) and impairing microvascular perfusion by forming protein aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CF may also serve as a biomarker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additional studies are warranted to fully evaluate the role of CF in IBD and the outcome should contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD </plain></SENT>
