<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients also had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in the frequency of HLA-B8 (60%) was found in the primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> patients compared with controls (25%) (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HLA-B8 was found in eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of HLA-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi> was significantly decreased (8%) compared with controls (30%) (p less than 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Piecemeal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was observed on liver histology in 66% of HLA-B8 positive and 50% of HLA-B8 negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Low titres of serum autoantibodies were frequently found in the primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> group but did not correspond to the presence of HLA-B8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Raised serum concentrations of IgM and IgG were not related to HLA-B8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study has shown that in patients with primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> there exists a disease susceptibility gene closely associated with the B locus of the major histocompatibility complex which may be modified by other factors such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and HLA-B8 may be particularly liable to develop primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
