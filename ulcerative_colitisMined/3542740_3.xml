<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An indirect immunofluorescence assay was used to test sera of 63 unrelated patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 21 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 36 control subjects against lymph nodes of athymic <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> (nu/nu) mice which had been injected with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> intestinal tissue filtrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty nine per cent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients, 10% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients and 3% of control sera reacted against lymph nodes of mice injected injected with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> intestinal tissue filtrates, 18% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> sera were with intestinal tissue homogenate from Dutch Crohn's patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With the lymph nodes of mice injected with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> intestinal tissue filtrates, 18% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> sera were positive, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and control sera were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lymph nodes from 18 of the 19 mice injected with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> tissue filtrates reacted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> sera, whereas only three of these 19 mice reacted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A comparative study, carried out in parallel with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> filtrate induced <z:mp ids='MP_0008102'>hyperplastic lymph nodes</z:mp> from the Bilthoven colony (W2) and from the New York colony (E671) using sera from 54 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients from Leiden, showed immunoreactivity with 44 and 57% of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> sera against the two <z:mp ids='MP_0008102'>hyperplastic lymph nodes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty six of the 54 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> sera (67%) reacted with either or both lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 11% of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> sera which were examined for immunofluorescence and lymphocytotoxic antibodies had lymphocytotoxic antibodies, whereas 40% and 46% of the same sera showed positive immunofluorescence against E671 and W2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Absorption studies indicated that lymphocytotoxic antibodies activity and the immunofluorescence against the primed <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mouse lymph node are mediated by different serum antibodies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reproducibility of the <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mouse immunofluorescence test system for a preferential immunoreactivity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> sera against <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> tissue primed murine lymph nodes has been confirmed by the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are necessary to find out whether crossreactive antigen(s) as recognised by some of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> sera in mice injected with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> tissue filtrate is similar to the antigen(s) detected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> sera in mice injected with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> tissue filtrates </plain></SENT>
