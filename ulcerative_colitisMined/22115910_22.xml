<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Loss of intestinal barrier function plays an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Shedding of intestinal epithelial cells is a potential cause of barrier loss during <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objectives of the study were (1) to determine whether cell shedding and barrier loss in humans can be detected by confocal endomicroscopy and (2) whether these parameters predict relapse of IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Confocal endomicroscopy was performed in IBD and control patients using intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> to determine the relationship between cell shedding and local barrier dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A grading system based on appearances at confocal endomicroscopy in humans was devised and used to predict relapse in a prospective pilot study of 47 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 11 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Confocal endomicroscopy in humans detected shedding epithelial cells and local barrier defects as plumes of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> effluxing through the epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mouse experiments demonstrated inward flow through some leakage-associated shedding events, which was increased when <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> osmolarity was decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In IBD patients in clinical remission, increased cell shedding with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> leakage was associated with subsequent relapse within 12 months after endomicroscopic examination (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for the grading system to predict a flare were 62.5% (95% CI 40.8% to 80.4%), 91.2% (95% CI 75.2 to 97.7) and 79% (95% CI 57.7 to 95.5), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cell shedding and barrier loss detected by confocal endomicroscopy predicts relapse of IBD and has potential as a diagnostic tool for the management of the disease </plain></SENT>
