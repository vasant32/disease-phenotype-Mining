<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Overproduction of colonic oxidants contributes to mucosal injury in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) but the mechanisms are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our recent findings using monolayers of intestinal cells suggest that the mechanism could be oxidant induced damage to cytoskeletal proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, oxidants and oxidative damage have not been well characterised in IBD mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine whether there are increases in oxidants and in tissue and cytoskeletal protein oxidation in IBD mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) and markers of oxidative injury (carbonylation and nitrotyrosination) to tissue and cytoskeletal proteins in colonic mucosa from IBD patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>) and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were correlated with IBD severity score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Inflamed mucosa showed the greatest increases in oxidants and oxidative damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Smaller but still significant increases were seen in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearing mucosa of patients with active and inactive IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tissue NO levels correlated with oxidative damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Actin was markedly (&gt;50%) carbonylated and nitrated in inflamed tissues of active IBD, less so in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearing tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Tubulin carbonylation occurred in parallel; tubulin nitration was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>NO and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measures of oxidative damage in tissue and cytoskeletal proteins in the mucosa correlated with IBD severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Disruption of the actin cytoarchitecture was primarily within the epithelial cells and paracellular area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Oxidant levels increase in IBD along with oxidation of tissue and cytoskeletal proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Oxidative injury correlated with disease severity but is also present in substantial amounts in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearing mucosa of IBD patients, suggesting that oxidative injury does not necessarily lead to tissue injury and is not entirely a consequence of tissue injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Marked actin oxidation (&gt;50%)-which appears to result from cumulative oxidative damage-was only seen in inflamed mucosa, suggesting that oxidant induced cytoskeletal disruption is required for tissue injury, mucosal disruption, and IBD flare up </plain></SENT>
