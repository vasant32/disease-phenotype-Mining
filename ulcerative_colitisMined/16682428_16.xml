<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Relapse of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> is difficult to predict by routine colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A high-resolution video-magnifying colonoscope with chromoscopy enables the observation of colorectal mucosal pit patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To investigate the association of pit patterns as assessed by magnifying colonoscopy (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e>) with histological <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and mucosal chemokine activity in patients with quiescent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and to prospectively analyse the prognostic factors that may predict exacerbations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> was performed in 113 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pit patterns in the rectal mucosa were classified into four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> grades on the basis of size, shape and arrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mucosal interleukin (IL) 8 activity was measured in biopsy specimens of rectal mucosa and the specimens were assessed for histological disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients were then followed until relapse or for a maximum of 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate survival analysis was carried out to determine the independent predictors of clinical relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A positive correlation was identified between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> grade, histological grade (p = 0.001) and mucosal IL8 activity (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate proportional hazard model analysis showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> grade was a significant predictor of relapse (relative risk 2.06, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier estimate of relapse during 12 months of follow-up was found to increase with increasing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> grade, with values of 0% for grade 1, 21% for grade 2, 43% for grade 3 and 60% for grade 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> grading is associated with the degree of histological <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and mucosal IL8 activity in patients with quiescent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and may predict the probability of subsequent disease relapse in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in remission </plain></SENT>
