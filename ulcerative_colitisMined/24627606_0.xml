<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis (MA) of comparative cohort and case-control studies published between January 1966 and March 2013 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies focusing on colectomy series and studies including only less than 3 patients in the treated or non-treated arm were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was colectomy within 30 d of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes included colectomy during the follow-up period Subgroup analyses by method of detection of CMV, study design, risk of bias and country of origin were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Quality of studies was evaluated according to modified New-Castle Ottawa Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After full-text review, nine studies with a total of 176 patients were included in our MA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the included studies were of low to moderate quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients who have received antiviral treatment had a higher risk of 30-d colectomy (OR = 2.40; 95%CI: 1.05-5.50; I² = 37.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A subgroup analysis including only patients in whom CMV diagnosis was based did not demonstrate a significant difference between the groups (OR = 3.41; 95%CI: 0.39-29.83; I² = 56.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analysis of long-term colectomy rates was possible for 6 studies including 110 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant difference was found between the treated and untreated groups (OR = 1.71; 95%CI: 0.71-4.13; 6 studies, I² = 0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Analysis of mortality rate was not possible due to a very limited number of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Stratification of the outcomes by disease severity was not possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: No positive association between antiviral treatment and a favorable outcome was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These findings should be interpreted cautiously due to primary studies' quality and potential biases </plain></SENT>
