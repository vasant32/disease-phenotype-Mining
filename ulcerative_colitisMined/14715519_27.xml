<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied epithelial transport and barrier function in IL-2(-/-) mice and used this model to characterize mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> during <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(22)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> and (36)Cl(-) fluxes were measured in proximal colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Net <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> flux was reduced from 4.0 +/- 0.5 to 0.8 +/- 0.5 micromol.h(-1).cm(-2), which was paralleled by diminished <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15378">H(+)</z:chebi> exchanger NHE3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Net Cl(-) flux was also decreased from 2.2 +/- 1.6 to -2.7 +/- 0.6 micromol.h(-1).cm(-2), indicating impaired <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-Cl(-) absorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In distal colon, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi>-induced electrogenic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> absorption was 6.1 +/- 0.9 micromol.h(-1).cm(-2) in controls and was abolished in IL-2(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of beta- and gamma-subunits of the epithelial <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel (ENaC) was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Epithelial barrier was studied in proximal colon by impedance technique and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> fluxes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, epithelial resistance was increased and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> fluxes were decreased in IL-2(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was in accord with the findings of reduced ion transport as well as increased expression of tight junction proteins occludin and claudin-1, -2, -3, and -5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the IL-2(-/-) mucosa exhibits impaired electroneutral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-Cl(-) absorption and electrogenic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> transport due to reduced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression of NHE3 and ENaC beta- and gamma-subunit <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This represents a model of early <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> with absorptive dysfunction due to impaired transport protein expression/function while epithelial barrier is still intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this model is ideal to study regulation of transporter expression independent of barrier defects </plain></SENT>
