<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the exact cause(s) and mechanisms of tissue damage in CD and UC have yet to be completely understood, enough progress has occurred to accept the following hypothesis as valid: IBD is an inappropriate immune response that occurs in genetically susceptible individuals as the result of a complex interaction among environmental factors, microbial factors, and the intestinal immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among an almost endless list of environmental factors, smoking has been identified as a risk factor for CD and a protective factor for UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among microbial factors, no convincing evidence indicates that classical infectious agents cause IBD, while mounting evidence points to an abnormal immune response against the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> enteric flora as being of central importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gut <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is mediated by cells of the innate as well as adaptive immune systems, with the additional contribution of non-immune cells, such as epithelial, mesenchymal and endothelial cells, and platelets </plain></SENT>
