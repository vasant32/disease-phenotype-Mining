<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these, 82 have been excluded, leaving 221 with a firm diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients have been divided into 'new cases', in which the disease was diagnosed at the Radcliffe Infirmary, and 'referred cases' in which the diagnosis was already made at the time of referral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this series, there were three main sites of involvement: small intestinal, large intestinal, and both small and large intestinal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0949272" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ileocolitis</z:e> was the commonest anatomical distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The disease showed progression to new, sites in a considerable number of the patients during the period under study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a fivefold increase of new cases between the first and third decades covered by the study and this applied equally to patients presenting as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> abdomen, which supports the idea that the disease is truly increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Survival curves have been plotted and compared with expected survival curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In terms of mortality, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> emerges as a disease which becomes progressively more dangerous as the years go by, which is in sharp contrast with the findings in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in which the main risk of dying is in the early years </plain></SENT>
