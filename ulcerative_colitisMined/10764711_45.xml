<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Nerve growth factor (NGF), a target derived factor for survival and maintenance of peripheral and central neurones, has been implicated in several <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To analyse the concomitant presence of NGF and its high affinity receptor TrkA in patients undergoing surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: CD tissues were obtained from 33 patients and UC tissue samples from 12 patients undergoing surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> intestinal tissue samples were obtained from 30 individuals through an organ donor programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Expression of NGF and TrkA was studied by northern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry, the respective <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> moieties and proteins were localised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis was used to confirm the specificity of NGF and TrkA antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In CD, NGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was increased in 60% (2.4-fold; p&lt;0.01) and TrkA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in 54% (1.3-fold; p&lt;0.05) of samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In UC, NGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was enhanced in 58% (2.4-fold; p&lt;0.01) and TrkA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in 50% (1.5-fold; p&lt;0.05) of samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridisation showed that NGF and TrkA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were often concomitantly present in polymorphonuclear-like cells of the lamina propria, in mast cells, and in a few ganglia of Auerbach's plexus and Meissner's plexus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry revealed that lamina propria cells and inflammatory cells (mainly mast cells) were NGF and TrkA immunopositive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>NGF was also present in Meissner's plexus (especially in CD) and TrkA in enteric glia surrounding intestinal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The concomitant enhanced expression of NGF and its receptor suggests activation of this pathway in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in CD and UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The presence of NGF and TrkA in both neural and non-neural structures in CD and UC supports the hypothesis that neuroimmune interactions occur and are activated in both disorders </plain></SENT>
