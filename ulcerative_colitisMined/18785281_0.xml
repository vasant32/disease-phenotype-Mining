<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess whether in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) patients with ileo-rectal anastomosis (IRA), ileal lesions may develop in the neo-terminal-ileum and their possible relation with phenotypic changes towards colonic epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 19 patients with IRA under regular follow up were enrolled, including 11 UC and 8 controls (6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, CD; 1 familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adenomatous polyposis</z:e>, FAP; 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, colon K) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ileal lesions were identified by ileoscopy with biopsies taken from the ileum (involved and uninvolved) and from the rectal stump </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Staining included HE and immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies against colonic epithelial protein CEP (Das-1) and human tropomyosin isoform 5, hTM5 (CG3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Possible relation between development of colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and ileal lesions was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Stenosing <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the rectal stump was detected in 1 UC patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neo-terminal ileum was therefore investigated in 10/11 UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ileal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were detected in 7/10 UC, associated with colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> in 4/7 (57.1%) and Das-1 and CG3 reactivity in 3/4 UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In controls, recurrence occurred in 4/6 CD, associated with colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> in 3/4 and reactivity with Das-1 and CG3 in 2/3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Present findings suggest that in UC, ileal lesions associated with changes towards colonic epithelium may develop also after IRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Changes of the ileal content after colectomy may contribute to the development of colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, leading to ileal lesions both in the pouch and in the neo-terminal ileum after IRA </plain></SENT>
