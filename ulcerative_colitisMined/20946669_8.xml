<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: S100A12, a calcium-binding proinflammatory protein secreted by granulocytes, has been associated with different diseases of inflammatory origin, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the utility of serum S100A12, in discriminating IBD from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022104" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IBS">irritable bowel syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>), was tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: S100A12 serum levels were determined in 64 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), 64 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and 73 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>, by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>S100A12 serum levels were evaluated with respect to the levels of known inflammatory markers and patients' characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median values of serum S100A12 levels were 68.2 ng/mL (range: 43.4-147.4) in UC, 70 ng/mL (41.4-169.8) in CD and 43.4 ng/mL (34.4-74.4) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>UC and CD patients had significantly higher serum S100A12 levels compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> patients (P = 0.001 for both comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a cut-off for serum S100A12 levels of 54.4 ng/mL could predict both UC and CD with a 66.7% sensitivity and a 64.4% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The area under curve was estimated at 0.67 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.60-0.75 (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Considering standard activity indices, higher serum S100A12 levels in active compared to inactive IBD were observed, although the recorded difference did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) levels, showed a statistically significant positive correlation with S100A12 (r = 0.39, P = 0.001 and r = 0.23, P = 0.02 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of circulating S100A12 are found in IBD, compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When used to distinguish IBD from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> adult patients, serum S100A12 levels exhibit moderate performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, serum S100A12 may serve as an inflammatory marker in IBD, since it is well correlated with CRP and SAA </plain></SENT>
