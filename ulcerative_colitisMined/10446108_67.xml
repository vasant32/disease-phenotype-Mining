<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) is partially genetically determined and the HLA class II genes are candidates for a role in genetic susceptibility to IBD, because their products play a central role in the immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multiple studies have reported associations between HLA-DR or -DQ phenotypes and either <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, but much of the data are still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To estimate overall associations between HLA class II phenotypes and IBD, and to establish the relative risk conferred by HLA-DR and -DQ phenotypes by meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medline was searched for publications reporting on the relation between IBD and HLA class II phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Raw data were extracted by recalculating the number of phenotypes or the number of alleles of the main antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios and confidence intervals were calculated according to the Mantel-Haenszel method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DR2, DR9, and DRB1*0103 were positively associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and a negative association was found for DR4 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> a positive association was found with DR7, DRB3*0301, and DQ4 and a negative association with DR2 and DR3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> are associated with specific HLA class II phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further analysis of these phenotypes and subgroup analysis may elucidate how these alleles contribute to susceptibility to IBD </plain></SENT>
