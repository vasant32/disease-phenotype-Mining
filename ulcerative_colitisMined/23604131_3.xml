<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) is increasing in Eastern Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reasons for these changes remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether an East-West gradient in the incidence of IBD in Europe exists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A prospective, uniformly diagnosed, population based inception cohort of IBD patients in 31 centres from 14 Western and eight Eastern European countries covering a total background population of approximately 10.1 million people was created </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One-third of the centres had previous experience with inception cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were entered into a low cost, web based epidemiological database, making participation possible regardless of socioeconomic status and prior experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 1515 patients aged 15 years or older were included, of whom 535 (35%) were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), 813 (54%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and 167 (11%) with IBD unclassified (IBDU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence rate ratios in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Western European centres were 1.9 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.4) for CD and 2.1 (95% CI 1.8 to 2.6) for UC compared with Eastern European centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median crude annual incidence rates per 100,000 in 2010 for CD were 6.5 (range 0-10.7) in Western European centres and 3.1 (range 0.4-11.5) in Eastern European centres, for UC 10.8 (range 2.9-31.5) and 4.1 (range 2.4-10.3), respectively, and for IBDU 1.9 (range 0-39.4) and 0 (range 0-1.2), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In Western Europe, 92% of CD, 78% of UC and 74% of IBDU patients had a colonoscopy performed as the diagnostic procedure compared with 90%, 100% and 96%, respectively, in Eastern Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>8% of CD and 1% of UC patients in both regions underwent surgery within the first 3 months of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>7% of CD patients and 3% of UC patients from Western Europe received biological treatment as rescue therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> European CD patients, 20% received only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="20551">5-aminosalicylates</z:chebi> as induction therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An East-West gradient in IBD incidence exists in Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Among this inception cohort--including indolent and aggressive cases--international guidelines for diagnosis and initial treatment are not being followed uniformly by physicians </plain></SENT>
