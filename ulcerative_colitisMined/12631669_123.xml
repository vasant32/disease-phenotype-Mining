<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Variants of the caspase activating recruitment domain 15/nucleotide oligomerisation domain 2 (CARD15/NOD2) gene have been associated with susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aim: Our aim was to evaluate the allele frequencies of the CARD15 variants R702W, G908R, and 1007fs in Finnish <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) patients and to search for possible associations between CARD15 variants and occurrence of familial forms of IBD or complicated forms of CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated 198 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> CD patients, 46 probands with familial CD, 27 CD probands from mixed IBD families, 99 unrelated patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), and 300 control individuals for the occurrence of the CARD15 gene variants R702W, G908R, and 1007fs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In CD patients, the allele frequencies for the rare variants of these polymorphisms were 3.3%, 0.6%, and 4.8% (total 8.7%), and the corresponding frequencies in healthy controls were 1.8%, 0%, and 1.7% (total 3.5%) (8.7% v 3.5%; p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In UC patients allele frequencies were comparable with those in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the 1007fs polymorphism variant allele was significantly higher among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CD patients than in controls (4.8% v 1.7%; p&lt;0.01) but there was no significant difference in allele frequencies between the CD and UC groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 1007fs allele frequency was higher in familial CD than in non-familial cases with CD (10.9% v 3.5%; p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the allele frequencies of the R702W and G908R polymorphisms between CD patients, UC patients, and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that 15.5% of CD patients, 9.1% of UC patients, and 6.7% of controls carried at least one of the CARD15 variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In CD patients carrying at least one of the three NOD2 variants, the ileum was affected more often than in non-carrier CD patients (90% v 73%; p&lt;0.05), they had stricturing or penetrating disease more often than non-carriers (88% v 56%; p&lt;0.01), and they had an increased need for bowel surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of NOD2 gene variants was lower in genetically homogenous Finns than in other populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 1007fs variant was associated with CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of CARD15 variants predicted ileal location as well as stricturing and penetrating forms of CD </plain></SENT>
