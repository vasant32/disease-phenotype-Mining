<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine whether left handedness is associated with IBD in two prospective national birth cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) were identified from two national longitudinal birth cohorts at age 26 years (1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70), born in 1970) and age 33 years (National Child Development Study (NCDS), born in 1958) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Laterality was determined at age 10 (BCS70) or seven (NCDS) years, based on hand preference for writing and foot preference for kicking a ball (BCS70 only) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the relationship of handedness with CD, UC, and IBD in the cohorts combined and adjusted for sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both cohorts combined showed increased adjusted relative odds of 2.13 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97--4.65; p=0.059), 2.13 (95% CI 0.92--4.91; p=0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>077), and 2.13 (95% CI 1.20--3.78; p=0.010) for CD, UC, and IBD, respectively in left handers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests a link between IBD and left handedness which may be genetic and/or environmental in origin </plain></SENT>
