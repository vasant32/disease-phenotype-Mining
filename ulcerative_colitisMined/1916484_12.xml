<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A prospective epidemiological and clinical study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> was undertaken in the Bedouin Arabs of southern Israel between 1981 and 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were six patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and the prevalence rate in 1990 was calculated to be 9.8/10(5) (95% confidence intervals 3.6-17.4) in the total population, or 6.2/10(5) (0.8-22.5) in men and 13.7/10(5) (3.7-35.0) in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> occurred, both in women; the prevalence rate was 3.2/10(5) (0.4-11.8) in the entire population, and 6.8/10(5) (0.8-17.5) in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence rates (age adjusted) in Arabs were significantly lower (p less than 0.01) than the corresponding rates in the local Jewish populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Bedouin patients were aged mean (SD) 34.0 (16.4) years at time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical features of both diseases resembled those in the Jewish and other reported populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the exposure of the Bedouin Arabs to the environmental causative factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> has hitherto been limited and thereby accounts for the rarity of these diseases in this population </plain></SENT>
