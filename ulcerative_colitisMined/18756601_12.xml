<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) distribution of NOD2/CARD15 (R702W, G908R), OCTN1 1672C/T and OCTN2-207G/C in Chinese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 61 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), 151 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), and 200 unrelated healthy controls were genotyped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genotyping was performed by sequence specific primer polymerase chain reaction (PCR-SSP) or by restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the subjects in our study groups, including patients with CD, UC and healthy controls, none had OCTN and CARD15 variants and very rare IBD family history was found in our patients with the percentage of 0 (0/61 with CD) and 1.3% (2/151 with UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that although OCTN or CARD15 variation is associated with susceptibility to IBD in Western populations, these might be rare and may not be associated with susceptibility to IBD in Chinese patients </plain></SENT>
