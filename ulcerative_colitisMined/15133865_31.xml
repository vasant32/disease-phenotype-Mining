<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the effects of probiotic on intestinal mucosae of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), and to evaluate the role of probiotic in preventing the relapse of UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty patients received treatment with sulphasalazine (SASP) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> and then were randomly administered bifid triple viable capsule (BIFICO) (1.26 g/d), or an identical placebo (<z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi>) for 8 wk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fecal samples were collected for stool culture 2 wk before and after the randomized treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were evaluated clinically, endoscopically and histologically after 2 mo of treatment or in case of relapse of UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>p65 and IkappaB expressions were determined by Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB in colonic nuclear extracts was detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of cytokines were identified by semi-quantitative assay, reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three patients (20%) in the BIFICO group had relapses during 2-mo follow-up period, compared with 14 (93.3%) in placebo group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The concentration of fecal lactobacilli, bifidobacteria was significantly increased in BIFICO-treated group only (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expressions of NF-kappaB p65 and DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB were significantly attenuated in the treatment group than that in control (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines was elevated in comparison with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The probiotic could impede the activation of NF-kappaB, decrease the expressions of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta and elevate the expression of IL-10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that oral administration of this new probiotic preparation is effective in preventing flare-ups of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It may become a prophylactic drug to decrease the relapse of UC </plain></SENT>
