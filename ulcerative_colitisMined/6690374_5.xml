<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At 36 weeks the length and wet weight of the duodenum and large bowel was 13-48% greater in animals with jejunoileal bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Measurements of villous height and crypt depth confirmed mucosal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> in the residual functioning small bowel and the distal colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histochemical studies in both groups of rats showed an overall predominance of sulphomucins throughout the intestinal tract, but jejunoileal bypass caused a disproportionate increase in the number of sialomucin containing goblet cells in functioning segments of small bowel and distal colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An abundance of sialomucin cells at the site of anastomosis after jejunoileal bypass may have been a protective response to local mechanical trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_139'>Goblet cell hyperplasia</z:mpath> is a feature of compensatory growth of the intestinal tract after surgical shortening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The changes in colonic mucin seen after jejunoileal bypass resemble those observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and mucosal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
