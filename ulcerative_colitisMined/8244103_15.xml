<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The possibility of a primary defect in the PUFA metabolism in IBD was hypothesised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess plasma PUFA pattern in inactive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> and to ascertain whether patients who had had a colectomy and who were suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> have a similar PUFA pattern than those patients with non-active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and who had not had a colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma fatty acids were analysed by semi-capillary column gas-liquid chromatography in three groups of patients with inactive IBD (24 patients with inactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> who had not had a colectomy, 15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> who had had a colectomy, and 27 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentration and percentage of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30081">C22</z:chebi>:6n3 and unsaturation index were significantly higher in patients with inactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> without a colectomy and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> group (p &lt; 0.0001) than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentration and percentage of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30081">C22</z:chebi>:6n3 and the unsaturation index remained significantly higher, in both the operated and non-operated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients when compared with controls (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that in inactive IBD, an increased PUFA biosynthesis might be the cause of the high values of n3 compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings although seen in active disease, are more noticeable in remission because of the lack of artefactual factors (<z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo>, steroids, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, persistence of high values in both groups of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients--that is, those who had had a colectomy and those who had not suggests the existence of a primary abnormality in the PUFA metabolism in IBD </plain></SENT>
