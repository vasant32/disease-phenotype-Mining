<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the outcomes of treatments for complications after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) in Korean patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between March 1998 and February 2013, 72 patients (28 male and 44 female, median age 43.0 years ± 14.0 years) underwent total proctocolectomy with IPAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study cohort was registered prospectively and analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient characteristics, medical management histories, operative findings, pathology reports and postoperative clinical courses, including early postoperative and late complications and their treatments, were reviewed from a medical record system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the ileal pouches were J-pouch and were performed with either the double-stapling technique (n = 69) or a hand-sewn (n = 3) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-one (43.1%) patients had early complications, with 12 (16.7%) patients with complications related to the pouch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pouch <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, pelvic abscesses and anastomosis ruptures were managed conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with pelvic abscesses were treated with surgical drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven (38.0%) patients had late complications during the follow-up period (82.5 ± 50.8 mo), with 21 (29.6%) patients with complications related to the pouch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> included antibiotics or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pouch-<z:hpo ids='HP_0004320'>vaginal fistulas</z:hpo>, perianal abscesses or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> and anastomosis strictures were treated surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pouch failure developed in two patients (2.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Analyses showed that an emergency operation was a significant risk factor for early pouch-related complications compared to elective procedures (55.6% vs 11.1%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pouchitis</z:e> was related to early (35.3%) and the other late pouch-related complications (41.2%) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The complications did not have an effect on pouch failure nor pouch function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The complications following IPAA can be treated successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Favorable long-term outcomes were achieved with a lower pouch failure rate than reported in Western patients </plain></SENT>
