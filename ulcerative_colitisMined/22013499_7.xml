<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These 'optical biopsy' technologies offer the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and yield, while facilitating real-time decision-making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although many endoscopic techniques have preliminarily shown high accuracy rates, these technologies are still evolving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This review will provide an overview of the most promising high-resolution imaging technologies, including high resolution microendoscopy, optical coherence tomography, endocytoscopy and confocal laser endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review will also discuss the application and current limitations of these technologies for the early detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
