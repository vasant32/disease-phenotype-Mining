<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To report our experience with the use of granulocytapheresis (GCAP) in 14 patients with active steroid-refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) in order to evaluate its efficacy in achieving remission and maintaining a long lasting symptom-free period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The activity of the disease was evaluated by clinical activity index (CAI) and endoscopic index (EI) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), while by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> activity index (CDAI) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were treated using the Adacolumn system, an adsorption column which selectively binds to granulocytes and monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One session/week of GCAP was performed for 5 wk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Steroids were stopped during apheresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients completed the five-week course showing no complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the end of the last session, 93% of patients showed a clinical remission of the disease that persisted for 6 mo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine months after the end of the treatment, 60% of the cases maintained remission, while 23% of the patients were still in clinical remission after 12 mo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Even if the number of our patients with steroid-refractory IBDs was not big, we can assert that GCAP is well tolerated and effective, especially in the first six months after the treatment, in a significant percentage of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of sustained response drops slightly after 6 mo and significantly after 12 mo, however the absence of severe side effects can be a stimulus for further evaluating new schedules of treatment </plain></SENT>
