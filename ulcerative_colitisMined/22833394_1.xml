<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The myeloid translocation genes (MTGs) are transcriptional corepressors with both Mtg8(-/-) and Mtgr1(-/-) mice showing developmental and/or differentiation defects in the intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the role of MTG16 in intestinal integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Baseline and stress induced colonic phenotypes were examined in Mtg16(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To unmask phenotypes, we treated Mtg16(-/-) mice with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="32149">sodium sulphate</z:chebi> (DSS) or infected them with Citrobacter rodentium and the colons were examined for ulceration and for changes in proliferation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mtg16(-/-) mice have altered immune subsets, suggesting priming towards Th1 responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mtg16(-/-) mice developed increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, diarrhoea, mortality and histological <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and there were increased innate (Gr1(+), F4/80(+), CD11c(+) and MHCII(+); CD11c(+)) and Th1 adaptive (CD4) immune cells in Mtg16(-/-) colons after DSS treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, there was <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> and a compensatory increased proliferation in Mtg16(-/-) colons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, Mtg16(-/-) mice exhibited increased colonic CD4;IFN-Î³ cells in vehicle-treated and DSS-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adoptive transfer of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> marrow into Mtg16(-/-) recipients did not rescue the Mtg16(-/-) injury phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Isolated colonic epithelial cells from DSS-treated Mtg16(-/-) mice exhibited increased KC (Cxcl1) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression when compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mtg16(-/-) mice infected with C rodentium had more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and greater <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> colonisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Last, MTG16 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were reduced in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> versus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These observations indicate that MTG16 is critical for colonocyte survival and regeneration in response to intestinal injury and provide evidence that this transcriptional corepressor regulates inflammatory recruitment in response to injury </plain></SENT>
