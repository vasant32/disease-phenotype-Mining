<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TLR9 were identified in healthy controls, and were assessed in 48 UC patients and 47 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Control subjects were matched for age, sex and date of blood sampling from among a subgroup of participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TLR9 -1486CC, 1174GG and 2848AA increase the risk of UC [odds ratio (OR) 2.64, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.73-6.53, P = 0.042], and TLR9 -1486TT, 1174AA and 2848GG decrease the risk of UC (OR 0.30, 95% CI: 0.10-0.94, P = 0.039), although there were no correlations between SNPs and disease phenotype or TLR9 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TLR9 polymorphisms are associated with increased susceptibility to UC </plain></SENT>
