<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most studies have focused on TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4 participation in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, few studies have explored other TLRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> profiles of TLR1 to 9 in colonic mucosa of UC patients, according to disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Colonic biopsies were taken from colon during colonoscopy in 51 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative Colitis</z:hpo> and 36 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of TLR1 to 9, Tollip, inflammatory cytokines IL6 and TNF were assessed by RT-qPCR with hydrolysis probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Characterization of TLR9 protein expression was performed by Immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Toll-like receptors TLR8, TLR9, and IL6 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were significantly higher in the colonic mucosa from UC patients (both quiescent and active) as compared to healthy individuals (p &lt; 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the UC patients group the TLR2, TLR4, TLR8 and TLR9 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were found to be significantly lower in patients with quiescent disease, as compared to those with active disease (p &lt; 0.05), whereas TLR5 showed a trend (p = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IL6 and TNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were significantly higher in the presence of active disease and help to discriminate between quiescent and active disease (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Also, IL6 and TNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> positively correlate with TLRs <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> with the exception for TLR3, with stronger correlations for TLR5, TLR8, and TLR9 (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TLR9 protein expression was mainly in the lamina propria infiltrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that TLR2, TLR4, TLR8, and TLR9 expression increases in active UC patients, and that the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels positively correlate with the severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> as well as with inflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
