<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NO regulates numerous processes in the gastrointestinal tract; however, the overall role that NO plays in <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NO is upregulated in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> as well as in animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There have been conflicting reports on whether NO protects or exacerbates injury in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> or is simply a marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the site, timing, and level of NO production modulate the effect on the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp>, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32149">sodium sulfate</z:chebi> model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> was assessed in murine lines rendered deficient in iNOS, nNOS, eNOS, or e/nNOS by targeted gene disruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The loss of nNOS resulted in more severe disease and increased mortality, whereas the loss of eNOS or iNOS was protective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, concomitant loss of eNOS reversed the susceptibility found in nNOS-/- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Deficiencies in specific NOS isoforms led to distinctive alterations of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp>, including changes in leukocyte recruitment and alterations in colonic lymphocyte populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present studies indicate that NO produced by individual NOS isoforms plays different roles in modulating an inflammatory process </plain></SENT>
