<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They may stimulate intestinal secretion and contribute to the production of diarrhoea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Platelet activating factor (PAF) may be responsible for a high proportion of this secretory response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens from inflamed and quiescent mucosa of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human colonic mucosa were cultured or co-cultured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The release of PAF, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28666">leukotriene D4</z:chebi> into the culture medium was measured and the ability of this culture medium, from inflamed and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues, to influence secretion in rat colonic mucosa was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PAF was liberated by inflamed tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Its release from quiescent but not <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue was stimulated by medium in which inflamed mucosal biopsy tissues had been cultured and by exogenous bradykinin and 5-hydroxytryptamine, but not by <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PAF stimulated eicosanoid production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rise in short circuit current produced in vitro by inflamed tissue culture medium was inhibited by the PAF receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (CV 6209) (46%) (32.4 (2.9) v 17.5 (1.19) muA.cm-2, p &lt; 0.005) and further by combined cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibition (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> plus ICI 207968) (58%) (32.4 (2.9) v 13.6 (1.9) muA.cm-2, p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="8711">Mepacrine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi> attenuated considerably the electrical response evoked by medium from inflamed mucosa to a similar extent (32.4 (2.9) v 6.3 (1.2) v 5.1 (0.9) muA.cm-2, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that PAF accounted for 46% of the culture medium secretory effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, any attempt to block its release in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> may have only a partial effect on their symptoms </plain></SENT>
