<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have demonstrated that enteric glial cells (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EGC</z:e>) participate in the homeostasis of the gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether enteroglial markers, including S100B protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), can serve as noninvasive indicators of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EGC</z:e> activation and disease activity in UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This clinical prospective study included 35 patients with UC and 40 age- and sex-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of UC was based on standard clinical, radiological, endoscopic, and histological criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical disease activity was evaluated using the Modified Truelove-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271977" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Witts</z:e> Severity Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum samples were analyzed for human GFAP and S100B using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>GFAP was not detected in the serum of either UC patients or controls (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, we found a significant (P &lt; 0.001) decrease in the serum S100B levels in the UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No correlation between the serum S100B level and the disease activity or duration was observed (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The serum S100B levels did not differ between UC patients with active disease (24 patients, 68.6%) or in remission (11 patients, 31.4%) (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients had significantly lower serum S100B levels, while GFAP was of no diagnostic value in UC patients </plain></SENT>
