<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For determination of intracellular content of EPX and ECP in granulocytes, 39 blood samples was collected and extracted with a buffer containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3567">cetyltrimethylammonium bromide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intracellular content of EPX was analysed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The intracellular content of ECP was analysed with the UniCAP(®) system as described by the manufacturer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical tests for calculations of results were χ(2) test, Fisher's exact test, ANOVA, Student-Newman-Keuls test, and Kaplan-Meier survival curve with Log-rank test for trend, the probability values of P &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The genotype frequency for males with UC and with an age of disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of ≥ 45 years (n = 57) was for ECP434 and ECP562, GG = 37%, GC = 60%, CC = 4% and GG = 51%, GC = 49%, CC = 0% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was significantly different from the healthy subject's genotype frequencies of ECP434 (GG = 57%, GC = 38%, CC = 5%; P = 0.010) and ECP562 (GG = 68%, GC = 29%,CC = 3%; P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The genotype frequencies for females, with an age of disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of ≥ 45 years with CD (n = 62), was for the ECP434 and ECP562 genotypes GG = 37%, GC = 52%, CC = 11% and GG = 48%, GC = 47% and CC = 5% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This was also statistically different from healthy controls for both ECP434 (P = 0.010) and ECP562 (P = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The intracellular protein concentration of EPX and ECP was calculated in μg/10(6) eosinophils and then correlated to the EPX 405 genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The protein content of EPX was highest in the patients with the CC genotype of EPX405 (GG = 4.65, GC = 5.93, and CC = 6.57) and for ECP in the patients with the GG genotype of EPX405 (GG = 2.70, GC = 2.47 and CC = 1.90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>ANOVA test demonstrated a difference in intracellular protein content for EPX (P = 0.009) and ECP (P = 0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The age of disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was linked to haplotypes of the EPX405, ECP434 and ECP562 genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Kaplan Maier curve showed a difference between haplotype distributions for the females with CD (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The highest age of disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was seen in females with the EPX405CC, ECP434GC, ECP562CC haplotype (34 years) and the lowest in females with the EPX405GC, ECP434GC, ECP562GG haplotype (21 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>For males with UC there was also a difference between the highest and lowest age of the disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (EPX405CC, ECP434CC, ECP562CC, mean 24 years vs EPX405GC, ECP434GC, ECP562GG, mean 34 years, P = 0.0009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The relative risk for UC patients with ECP434 or ECP562-GC/CC genotypes to develop <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was 2.5 (95%CI: 1.2-5.4, P = 0.01) and 2.5 (95%CI: 1.1-5.4, P = 0.02) respectively, compared to patients carrying the GG-genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Polymorphisms of EPX and ECP are associated to IBD in an age and gender dependent manner, suggesting an essential role of eosinophils in the pathophysiology of IBD </plain></SENT>
