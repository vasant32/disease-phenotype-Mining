<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Currently available drugs for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) include <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30762">salicylates</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and new anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-α biologics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among these medications, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> in children and adolescents may adversely affect the patients' growth and development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further, UC patients have elevated and activated myeloid lineage leucocytes including the CD14 + CD16+ monocytes, which release TNF-α as a significant exacerbating factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of these cells by granulocyte/monocyte adsorption (GMA) should alleviate <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and promote UC remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of GMA in children and adolescents in whom conventional first-line medications had failed to induce remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a single centre setting, between 2007 and 2012, a total of 24 consecutive children and adolescents, age 11-19 years were given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> or sulphasalazine as a first-line medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients relapsed or did not respond to the first-line medications, and received GMA with the Adacolumn, 2 sessions in the first week, and then weekly, up to 11 sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients who achieved a decrease of ���5 in the clinical activity index (CAI) were to continue with GMA, while non-responders were to receive 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg/day <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> (PSL) plus additional GMA sessions similar to GMA responder cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At entry and week 12, patients were clinically and endoscopically evaluated, allowing each patient to serve as her/his own control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven patients achieved remission with the first-line medications and did not receive GMA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five patients did not respond to the first 5 GMA sessions and received PSL plus GMA, while 12 patients responded to the first 5 GMA sessions and received additional sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At entry, the average CAI was 12.7 ± 2.5, range 8-17, and the average endoscopic index was 8.5 ± 1.5, range 7-11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The corresponding values at week 12 were 2.1 ± 0.2, range 1-4 (P &lt; 0.001) and 2.4 ± 0.2, range 1-4 (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>PSL was tapered to 0 mg within 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: With the strategy we applied in this study, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 24 consecutive patients achieved remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In growing patients with active UC refractory to first-line medications, GMA was associated with clinical remission and mucosal healing, while in non-responders to GMA monotherapy, addition of a low dose PSL enhanced the efficacy of GMA and tapering of the PSL dose soon after remission was not associated with UC relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the majority of young <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> naive UC patients in whom first-line <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30762">salicylates</z:chebi> have failed may respond to GMA and be spared from additional drug therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Avoiding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> at an early stage of UC should ensure better long-term clinical course </plain></SENT>
