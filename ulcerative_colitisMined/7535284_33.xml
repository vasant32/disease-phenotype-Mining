<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although leucocyte rolling and tenuous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> are probably regulated by inducible selectins on vascular endothelia, little is known about the expression of these molecules in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using immunohistochemistry on surgically resected specimens, this study investigated endothelial P-selectin (CD62, granular membrane protein-140) in frozen sections of histologically uninvolved tissues adjacent to <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> = 10; <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> = 10), from highly inflamed areas (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> = 20; <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> = 13), and from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bowel (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By light microscopy, two forms of P-selectin immunoreactivity were detected that apparently corresponded ultrastructurally to stored and released distributions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gut, there was a 3.7-fold increase of P-selectin immunoreactivity on veins (p &lt; 0.0001), venules (p &lt; 0.0001), and capillaries (p &lt; 0.05) in the highly inflamed gut, without differences between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the uninvolved gut, P-selectin expression was similar to that seen in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, except for a focal increase of P-selectin in the vicinity of small lymphocyte aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The dramatic upregulation of P-selectin in the inflamed tissue and its potential role in leucocyte trafficking support the concept of P-selectin blocking therapy for the control of active IBD </plain></SENT>
