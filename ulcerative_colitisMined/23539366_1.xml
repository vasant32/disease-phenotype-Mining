<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 2 (CRF2) expression in the colon of healthy subjects and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined CRF2 gene and protein expression in the distal/sigmoid colonic mucosal biopsies from healthy subjects and patients with UC (active or disease in remission), human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus (HIV) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022104" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IBS">functional bowel disease</z:e> (FBD) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Gene expression of CRF2 was demonstrated in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human colonic biopsies, but not in the human colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell line Caco2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Receptor protein localization showed immunoreactive CRF2 receptors in the lamina propria and in the epithelial cells of the distal/sigmoid biopsy samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, CRF2 immunoreactivity was no longer observed in epithelial cells of patients with mild-moderately active UC and disease in remission, while receptor protein expression did not change in the lamina propria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No differences in CRF2 expression profile were observed in distal/sigmoid intestinal biopsies from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> and FBD patients, showing no signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The down-regulation of the CRF2 receptor in the distal/sigmoid biopsies of UC patients is indicative of change in CRF2 signalling associated with the process of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
