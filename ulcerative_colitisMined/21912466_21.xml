<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several endoscopic surveillance strategies have been implemented to identify these lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main issue is that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> often occurs in flat mucosa, often being detected on taking random biopsies rather than by identification of these lesions via endoscopic imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The standard diagnostic procedure in long lasting UC is to take four biopsies every 10 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Image enhancement methods, such as chromoendoscopy and virtual histology using endomicroscopy, have greatly improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> detection rates and may contribute to reduced random biopsies by taking targeted "smart" biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chromoendoscopy may effectively be performed by experienced endoscopists for routine screening of UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, endomicroscopy is often only available in selected specialized endoscopic centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, advanced endoscopic imaging has the potential to increase the detection rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> whereas the interplay between endoscopic experience and interpretation of histological biopsy evaluation allows the physician to make a proper diagnosis and to find the appropriate therapeutic approach </plain></SENT>
