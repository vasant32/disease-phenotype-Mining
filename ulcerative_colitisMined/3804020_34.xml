<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 12 patients <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> was complicated by the development of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>: one had three synchronous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only four of 14 <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> were DNA aneuploid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="16991">Deoxyribonucleic acid</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> occurred focally in the colorectal mucosa in the presence and absence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>: rates of <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> (67% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients and 42% in non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients), were not significantly different (chi 2 = 1.0962, p = 0.295) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A higher rate of DNA <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> was found in dysplastic tissues (21%) compared with non-dysplastic tissues (15%), but again these differences did not reach statistical significance (chi 2 = 1.0747, p = 0.299) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="16991">Deoxyribonucleic acid</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> and dysplastic change occurred more often with increasing duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (p less than 0.001, p less than 0.005 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that flow cytometric analysis of cellular DNA content should not replace present morphological methods of assessment of premalignancy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, but may be a useful adjunct in the identification of abnormal mucosa </plain></SENT>
