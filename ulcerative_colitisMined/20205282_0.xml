<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To examine the feasibility of predicting the flare-up of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) before symptoms emerge using the immunochemical fecal occult blood test (I-FOBT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively measured fecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentrations in 78 UC patients using the I-FOBT every 1 or 2 mo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a 20 mo-period, 823 fecal samples from 78 patients were submitted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median concentration of fecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> was 41 ng/mL (range: 0-392 500 ng/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were three types of patients with regard to the correlation between I-FOBT and patient symptoms; the synchronous transition type with symptoms (44 patients), the unrelated type with symptoms (19 patients), and the flare-up predictive type (15 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with the flare-up predictive type, the values of I-FOBT were generally low during the study period with stable symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two to four weeks before the flare-up of symptoms, the I-FOBT values were high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, in these patients, I-FOBT could predict the flare-up before symptoms emerged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Flare-up could be predicted by I-FOBT in approximately 20% of UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results warrant periodical I-FOBT in UC patients </plain></SENT>
