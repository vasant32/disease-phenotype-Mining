<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of both entities of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD), namely <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), is still complex and under investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The importance of the microbial flora in developing IBD is beyond debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the last few years, the focus has changed from adaptive towards innate immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Crohn's <z:mp ids='MP_0009482'>ileitis</z:mp> is associated with a deficiency of the antimicrobial shield, as shown by a reduced expression and secretion of the Paneth cell defensin HD5 and HD6, which is related to a Paneth cell differentiation defect mediated by a diminished expression of the Wnt transcription factor TCF4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In UC, the protective mucus layer, acting as a physical and chemical barrier between the gut epithelium and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> microbes, is thinner and in part denuded as compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This could be caused by a missing induction of the goblet cell differentiation factors Hath1 and KLF4 leading to immature goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This defective Paneth and goblet cell differentiation in Crohn's <z:mp ids='MP_0009482'>ileitis</z:mp> and UC may enable the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> microbes to invade the mucosa and trigger the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The exact molecular mechanisms behind ileal CD and also UC must be further clarified, but these observations could give rise to new therapeutic strategies based on a stimulation of the protective innate immune system </plain></SENT>
