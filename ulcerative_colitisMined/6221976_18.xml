<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighteen <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and 16 patients with a variety of non-inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disorders</z:e> were studied as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between patient and control groups in the proportions of circulating T lymphocytes or their subsets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, absolute numbers of T lymphocytes were reduced in patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OKT4+ T cell numbers were reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, whether active (p less than 0.02) or inactive (p less than 0.05) and in active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (p less than 0.05) Numbers of OKT8+ T cells were reduced in active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in T lymphocyte numbers between the patient groups and the disease control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The OKT4+:OKT8+ ratio in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> did not differ from that in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No relation was found between any of the parameters studied and disease activity, site, or extent of disease, or treatment with sulphasalazine or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of Ia-like, HLA-DR antigens on T cells was detected using a double marker immunofluorescence technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In control subjects up to 7% of OKT3+ cells were HLA-DR+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In only three patients was the proportion of HLA-DR+ cells greater than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> does not depend upon an alteration in the proportion of circulating T lymphocytes nor upon an imbalance of T lymphocyte subsets as defined by monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The reduction in T lymphocyte numbers may result from mucosal infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The findings also suggest that circulating T lymphocytes are not activated </plain></SENT>
