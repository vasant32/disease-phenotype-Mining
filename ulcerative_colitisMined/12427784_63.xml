<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether colonic epithelial cells produce MIP-3alpha and whether its expression is upregulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We found that interleukin 1beta and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha dose dependently stimulated MIP-3alpha production in Caco-2 and HT-29 intestinal epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In cytokine treated Caco-2 and HT-29 cells, a significant increase in MIP-3alpha protein production was observed after three hours and continued for at least 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of colonic tissues by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction and ELISA revealed significantly elevated MIP-3alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels (7.9-fold; p&lt;0.05) and protein levels (8.9-fold; p&lt;0.05) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> compared with controls or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MIP-3alpha immunoreactivity in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> was principally associated with crypt and surface epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, MIP-3alpha protein levels were elevated in primary epithelial cells isolated from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that increased enterocyte MIP-3alpha production may play an important role in lymphocyte activation and recruitment to the colonic epithelium in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
