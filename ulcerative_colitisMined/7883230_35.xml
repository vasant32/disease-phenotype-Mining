<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This association was examined in a prospective cohort of 47,678 American men, 40 to 75 years of age, and free of diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticular disease</z:e>, colon or rectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> before 1988 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During four years of follow up, 382 newly diagnosed cases of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticular disease</z:e> were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, energy adjusted dietary fibre, and energy adjusted total fat, overall physical activity was inversely associated with the risk of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticular disease</z:e> (for highest versus lowest extremes, relative risk (RR) = 0.63 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45, 0.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most of the inverse association was attributable to vigorous activity, for extreme categories RR = 0.60 (95% CI 0.41, 0.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For activity that was not vigorous the RR was 0.93 (95% CI 0.67, 1.69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several specific activities were inversely associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticular disease</z:e>, but jogging and running combined was the only individual activity that was statistically significant (p for trend = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For men in the lowest quintile for dietary fibre intake and total physical activity (compared with those in the opposite extreme), the RR was 2.56 (95% CI 1.36, 4.82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Physical activity, along with a high fibre diet, may be an important factor in the prevention of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
