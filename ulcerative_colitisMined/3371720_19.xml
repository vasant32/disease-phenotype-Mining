<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, cells from mucosa affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> [11.9 (4.3%) n = 23] or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> [8.4 (2.7%) n = 18] released significantly more <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi> than the non-inflamed groups </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, release values were greater in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> than <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, cells obtained from histologically inflamed mucosa released significantly more <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi> [9.7 (2.5%) n = 11] than those from non-inflamed mucosa [6.4 (1.5%) n = 7, p less than 0.02] whereas, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, abnormal release values were found in 8 of 13 cell populations isolated from mucosa showing no histological evidence of active disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In five patients with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, cells from mucosa not apparently involved demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi> release in four of five studies despite abnormal release from cells from involved mucosa suggesting that a diffuse abnormality of the colonic epithelial cell is not usually present </plain></SENT>
