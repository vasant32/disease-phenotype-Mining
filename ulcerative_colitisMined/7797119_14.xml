<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three types of mucin were identified after organ culture of colonic biopsy specimens with a dual label of [3H]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">glucosamine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">[35S]</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi>: type A had a high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">[35S]</z:chebi>:[3H] ratio and high incorporation ([3H] dpm/micrograms DNA &gt; 500); type B had a low ratio and high incorporation; and type C had low incorporation but with either high (C1) or low (C2) ratios </plain></SENT>
