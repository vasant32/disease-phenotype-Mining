<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was significantly increased density of TNF alpha immunoreactive cells in the lamina propria of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> specimens, although the distribution of these cells differed in the two conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> most of the TNF alpha immunoreactivity was seen in the subepithelial macrophages, with comparatively less in the deep lamina propria, while in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> immunoreactive cells were distributed evenly throughout the lamina propria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased submucosal immunoreactivity was found only in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, in which TNF alpha positive macrophages tended to cluster around arterioles and venules, often infiltrating and disrupting vascular endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that this degree of TNF alpha production probably contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, by impairing the integrity of epithelial and endothelial membranes, increasing inflammatory cell recruitment, and by prothrombotic effects on the vascular endothelium </plain></SENT>
