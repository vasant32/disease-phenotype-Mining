<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three of the treated patients had contracted red cells, an abnormality that is thought to result in mild haemolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Red cell contraction was related to the dose of sulphasalazine (P smaller than 0.01), the serum total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="132842">sulphapyridine</z:chebi> level (P smaller than 0.001), and acetylator status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the treated patients had a <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp>, 21 had elevated levels of methaemoglobin, and one had Heinz bodies </plain></SENT>
