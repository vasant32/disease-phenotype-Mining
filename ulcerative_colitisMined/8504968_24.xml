<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epithelial and lamina propria mononuclear cells were isolated from surgical specimens from control, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Platelet activating factor was extracted from highly purified cell preparations with 80% <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> after stimulation with and without 0.2 uM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> A23187 and was measured by platelet aggregation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both cell types generated platelet activating factor activity and this was generally comparable for epithelial and lamina propria cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basal and stimulated platelet activating factor activity of epithelial and lamina propria cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients was appreciably higher than that of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stimulation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> increased appreciably platelet activating factor activity in lamina propria cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only epithelial cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> showed an appreciable increase after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that epithelial cells are important contributors to intestinal platelet activating factor generation under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and inflammatory conditions and that epithelial cells actively play a part in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
