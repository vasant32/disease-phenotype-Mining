<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Once tolerated and therapeutic, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi> have many advantages over biologics for long-term maintenance therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it has been documented that intolerance and adverse events are common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have previously published our 36 month follow-up data reporting that 56.5% of our patients stop <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi> due to side effects, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>abnormal liver function tests</z:hpo> (LFTs) or therapeutic failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Low dose <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi> (LDAA) co-therapy is a well proven treatment option for patients who develop side effects or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235378,C0348754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">hepatotoxicity</z:e> with standard dose <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LDAA has been used at our institution since 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AIM: to report the safety, tolerability and therapeutic outcome at 12 months, for LDAA in patients who have failed standard dose <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We maintain a prospective IBD data-base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After starting LDAA we monitor full blood count and LFTs weekly for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>6-Thioguanine (6-TGN) and 6-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">Methyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50667">mercaptopurine</z:chebi> (6 MMPN) nucleotide levels are checked at 4-6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We searched our database for patients who started LDAA and had a minimum of 12 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We recorded the indications for therapy, metabolite levels, and blood monitoring and clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 62 patients were started on LDAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>25 (40%) were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 47 (range 16 - 77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Disease type was UC, 21; CD, 35; IBD(U), 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Reasons intolerant to standard dose <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> were: drug side effects (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo>) 24; <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> (ALT 2x upper limit <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) 20; Hypermethylation (TGN: MMPN ratio &gt;11), 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001997'>Gout</z:hpo> 4; High TPMT 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>At 12 months 44 (70%) remained on LDAA and were in clinical remission (HBI &lt;1 for CD), (stool frequency &lt;4 and no <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> for UC) with therapeutic 6TGN levels on LDAA, of these 7 (11%) required additional treatment with biologic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 18 (29%) patients, 3 (5%) were lost to follow up and 1 (2%) chose to stop LDAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>1 patient (UC) required a colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>3 (5%) stopped LDAA to conceive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>10/62 (16%) remained intolerant and treatment was stopped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>One patient developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> WCC &lt;3 and stopped therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>No patients developed abnormal LFTs on LDAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: LDAA is well tolerated and effective in patients who failed standard dose <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> due to drug side effects and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235378,C0348754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">hepatotoxicity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>This therapy results in resolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235378,C0348754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">hepatotoxicity</z:e> and will allow more IBD patients to achieve clinical remission </plain></SENT>
