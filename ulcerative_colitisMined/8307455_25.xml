<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>C-reactive protein (CRP) is a participating prominent component of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase response in active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed at determining the comparative role of the cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), in driving CRP production in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, and to test the hypothesis that there is a difference in the profile of cytokines generated in these two conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum CRP, the release of the cytokines IL-1 beta and IL-6 from monocytes, and the ability of monocyte conditioned medium to stimulate CRP synthesis by hepatocytes in an in vitro system was measured in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monocytes from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> produced more 1L beta-1 than monocytes from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no increased tendency for monocytes from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients to produce more 1L-6, so the greater circulating values of IL-6 reported by a number of authors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> may reflect the participation of a larger number of cells of the monocyte-macrophage series, or production of IL-6 by other cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correlation of cytokine production by monocytes with in vitro CRP release from cultured hepatocytes in response to monocyte conditioned medium showed that, in that system, IL-1 beta was the stronger stimulus to CRP production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some of the differences in the inflammatory processes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> may reflect differences in the amount of IL-1beta and IL-6 generated from macrophages and monocytes </plain></SENT>
