<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Total enteral nutrition was given to 26 as the sole nutritional supply and to 17 in conjunction with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ward diet, when appropriate, according to the severity of attack (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nutritional state was assessed and classified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients at admission and at the end of the study, by measuring the triceps skinfold thickness, mid arm muscle circumference, and serum albumin concentration as representative of body fat, muscle protein, and visceral protein, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At admission the three nutritional variables were not statistically different between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly positive effect on mid arm muscle circumference in patients on total enteral nutrition compared with the control group, but there was no effect on either triceps skinfold thickness or serum albumin concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentage of subjects requiring intravenous albumin infusion, however, was significantly less in the group fed enterally than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, fewer patients in the group fed enterally required surgical treatment compared with the control group, despite the fact that one of the criteria for starting enteral nutritional support was the expectancy that surgery would be needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total enteral nutrition was well tolerated and no major side effects arose during its use in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> exacerbations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
