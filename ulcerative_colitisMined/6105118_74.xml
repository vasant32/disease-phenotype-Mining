<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, 170 patients were allotted at random to three treatment groups, in which the daily dose was 1, 2 and 4 g respectively, and the trial period of treatment lasted for six months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A daily dose of 2 g was found to be much more efficacious than 1 g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A daily dose of 4 g was more efficacious than 2 g but at the price of fairly frequent symptomatic side-effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850715" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Haematological abnormalities</z:e> were observed at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dosage levels, but they occurred chiefly among the patients on 4 g daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both symptomatic and the haematological side-effects were usually associated with high concentrations of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="132842">sulphapyridine</z:chebi> and these high levels occurred chiefly among the slow acetylators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that, for general use, a daily dose of 2 g sulphasalazine is satisfactory for the maintenance treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If a patient does not do well on 2 g daily, it is worth trying a larger dose but in this case the patient's condition should be monitored by blood film, <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi>, MCV, and reticulocyte count </plain></SENT>
