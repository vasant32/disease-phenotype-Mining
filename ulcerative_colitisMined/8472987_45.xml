<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty five resection specimens from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> were compared with 12 specimens from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 13 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specimens were fixed either by immersion in formalin in the routine way or by perfusion fixation with formalin at mean arterial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining for macrophages, vessel wall, and blood constituents allowed identification of small mucosal capillaries which were not apparent otherwise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> damage and rupture of these small capillaries occurred before infiltration of the lamina propria by inflammatory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Loss of the overlying epithelium seemed to follow this vascular damage </plain></SENT>
