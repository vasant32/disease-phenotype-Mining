<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The aetiopathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD), is not yet fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Autoimmune mechanisms are thought to play a role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, but the target antigens and the underlying pathways have not been sufficiently identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Based on data from immunoblotting and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, the major antigenic target of pancreatic autoantibodies (PABs), which are specific for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specificity of autoantibody reactivity was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) using purified rat and human recombinant GP2 synthesised in transiently transfected mammalian HEK 293 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) and IIF were used to detect <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and antigen localisation in human colon biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The major zymogen granule membrane <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 2 (GP2) was identified as the autoantigen of PABs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PAB-positive sera from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (n = 42) displayed significantly higher IgG reactivity to rat GP2 in ELISA than either PAB-negative sera (n = 31), or sera from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (n = 49), or sera from blood donors (n = 69) (p&lt;0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight (66%) and 18 (43%) of 42 PAB-positive sera demonstrated IgG and IgA reactivity to human recombinant GP2 in IIF, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with PAB-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (n = 31) were not reactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>GP2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcription was significantly higher in colon biopsies from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (n = 4) compared to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (n = 4) (p = 0.0286) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunochemical staining confirmed GP2 expression in human colon biopsies from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Anti-GP2 autoantibodies constitute novel <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>-specific markers, the quantification of which could significantly improve the serological diagnosis of IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The expression of GP2 in human enterocytes suggests an important role for anti-GP2 response in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
