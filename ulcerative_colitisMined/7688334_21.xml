<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens from control subjects and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The specimens were organ cultured with bubbling air or nitrogen, and inhibition of the reduction by catalase (a <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> scavenger), para-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16509,39439">benzoquinone</z:chebi> (a tissue permeable <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> scavenger), or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> scavenger) was assayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dye was reduced by epithelial cells, vascular endothelium, and infiltrating mononuclear cells of the mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Its reduction by vascular endothelium and infiltrating mononuclear cells was greater in inflamed mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reduction by vascular endothelium and infiltrating mononuclear cells was inhibited in cultures with nitrogen saturation or with 1 mM para-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16509,39439">benzoquinone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The vascular endothelium seems to produce <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> in the inflamed mucosa, which would exacerbate tissue injury in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
