<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Drug therapy with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> or sulphasalazine received in vivo was found to have no effect on the motility of the washed neutrophils and monocytes in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This work adds to the evidence that monocytes are activated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> but does not support the hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> is due to an inherent defect in phagocyte motility </plain></SENT>
