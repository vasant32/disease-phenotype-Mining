<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Up to 29% of patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) fail to respond to steroid treatment and require surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have failed to show a clear correlation between failure of steroid treatment in severe UC and measures of disease severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The reasons for treatment failure therefore remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the hypothesis that patients with severe UC who fail to respond to steroid treatment have steroid resistant T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen patients with severe UC were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After seven days' treatment with high dose intravenous steroids they were classified as complete responders (CR), incomplete responders (IR), or treatment failures (TF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within 48 hours of admission blood was taken and the antiproliferative effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> on phytohaemagglutinin stimulated peripheral blood T lymphocytes was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Maximum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> induced inhibition of proliferation (I(max)) was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In vitro T lymphocyte steroid sensitivity of TF and IR patients was significantly less than that of CR patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both TF and 3/5 IR patients had an I(max) of less than 60%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CR patients had an I(max) of greater than 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was seen between response to treatment and disease severity on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When in vitro T lymphocyte steroid sensitivity was remeasured three months later, there was no difference between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that T lymphocyte steroid resistance is an important factor in determining response to steroid treatment in patients with severe UC and may be more predictive of outcome than disease severity </plain></SENT>
