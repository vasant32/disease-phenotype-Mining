<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IGF-I <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was quantified by RNase protection assay in uninvolved and involved intestine of 13 CD patients (10 ileum, 3 colon) and 7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) patients (colon) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization histochemistry compared the localization of IGF-I and procollagen alpha1(I) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Masson's trichrome staining and immunohistochemistry for IGF-I precursor, alpha-smooth muscle actin (A), vimentin (V), desmin (D), and c-kit were used to examine the mesenchymal cell subtypes that express IGF-I and collagen in uninvolved and involved ileum and colon of CD patients and "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>" ileum and colon from noninflammatory controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IGF-I <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was elevated in involved ileum and colon of patients with CD but not in involved colon of patients with UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IGF-I and procollagen alpha1(I) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> showed overlapping distribution within fibrotic submucosa and muscularis propria of involved CD ileum and colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In involved CD intestine, increased IGF-I precursor expression localized to mesenchymal cells in regions of tissue disorganization and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> in muscularis mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis propria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these regions, there were increased numbers of V(+) cells relative to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or uninvolved intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased IGF-I expression was localized to cells with a phenotype typical of fibroblasts (V(+)/A(-)/D(-)), myofibroblasts (V(+)/A(+)/D(+)), and, to a lesser extent, cells with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> enteric smooth <z:mp ids='MP_0005369'>muscle phenotype</z:mp> (V(-)/A(+)/D(+)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that increased IGF-I expression in multiple mesenchymal cell subtypes and increased numbers of cells with fibroblast/myofibroblast phenotype are involved in <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> associated with CD </plain></SENT>
