<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Olsalazine 250 mg four times daily significantly accelerated gastric emptying (mean +/- SD; 45.3 +/- 24.2 min v 67.3 +/- 33.1 min, p less than 0.05), mouth to caecum transit time (242 +/- 41 min v 325 +/- 33 min, p less than 0.02) and whole gut transit time (60.5 +/- 26 h v 37.8 +/- 17.8 h, p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No significant changes were seen in mean daily stool weight (215 +/- 41 g v 162 +/- 62 g) and mean daily stool frequency (2.2 +/- 0.6 v 2.4 +/- 1.8) </plain></SENT>
