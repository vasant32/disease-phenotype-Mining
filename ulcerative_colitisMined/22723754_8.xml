<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate the possible impact of CMV disease on IBD patients, we reviewed charts of patients admitted through the emergency department with diagnoses of IBD and CMV over a 10-year period (January 2000 to November 2009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Laboratory test results and pharmacology databases were scrutinized, and pathology slides were re-evaluated when possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The control group consisted of a historical group of IBD patients with fares who had been similarly evaluated in the emergency department but who did not have a diagnosis of CMV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both chi-square tests and the student's t-test were used for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study consisted of 31 patients with IBD and CMV (median age, 60 years; 65% male; 58% <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis in 19 cases (61%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine patients with CMV and IBD underwent a colectomy (29%) compared to 65 of the 581 patients in the control group (11.2%), who were evaluated during the same time period but did not have CMV (P=.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mortality was similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with CMV, 11 received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in outcomes were noted with antiviral therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although CMV disease is relatively uncommon in IBD patients, its presence may designate an increased risk for colectomy for reasons that are not yet clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patient outcomes may be independently affected by age and comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Systematic prospective studies could help determine the true effects of CMV on IBD patients </plain></SENT>
