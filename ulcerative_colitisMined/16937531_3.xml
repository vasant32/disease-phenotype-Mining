<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To estimate the serum alpha1-antichymotrypsin (ACT), alpha1-acid <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (AGP) and transferrin (Tf) concentrations and to evaluate the microheterogeneity of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase proteins in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and 17 healthy control subjects were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were categorised as severe (n = 9), moderate (n = 10) and mild groups (n = 8) using Truelove and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271977" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Witts</z:e>' classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microheterogeneity of ACT, AGP and Tf was analysed by crossed immunoaffinity electrophoresis (CIAE) with concanavalin A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> serum samples standard electrophoresis of serum proteins was performed, iron (Fe) concentration, total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> had significantly higher serum ACT and AGP concentrations and lower serum transferrin concentration in comparison to healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Changes in concentrations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase proteins were dependent on the activity of the inflammatory process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The glycosylation patterns of transferrin were related to the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also observed the correlation between ACT and AGP concentrations, patterns of transferrin glycosylation and changes in standard protein electrophoresis or blood cell count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The glycosylation patterns of transferrin obtained from patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> are highly branched and sialylated compared with those obtained from healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the glycosylation patterns of transferrin do not differ according to the activity index of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The microheterogeneity patterns of AGP and ACT are similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients and healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
