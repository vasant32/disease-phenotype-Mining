<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They were evaluated by using a lactulose tolerance test and measuring blood anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47040">lipid A</z:chebi> antibody concentrations, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lactulose tolerance tests were performed 22 times in 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), 19 times in 12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), and 12 times in 12 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood lactulose concentrations were measured after oral administration every two hours for eight hours, also blood C reactive protein concentrations and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47040">lipid A</z:chebi> antibody concentrations were measured just before lactulose administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood lactulose concentrations were significantly higher in patients with CD than in the controls from two to eight hours after administration, while in UC they were significantly higher than in the controls from six to eight hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Maximum blood lactulose concentrations in each tolerance test in patients with the active phase significantly exceeded those in the inactive phase of either CD or UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was also seen between the maximum blood lactulose concentrations and the C reactive protein concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47040">lipid A</z:chebi> antibody concentrations in patients with CD were significantly higher than in the controls as well as in patients with UC in immunoglobulin (Ig) A class and IgG class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In UC they were significantly higher than in the controls in IgA class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>But, they were not related to the severity of the disease of either CD or UC, and not correlated significantly with the maximum blood lactulose concentrations in either CD or UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The intestinal permeability and the immune response to enteric <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> antigens in patients with inactive CD were significantly increased over those in the controls as well as in patients with inactive UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that an increase of the intestinal permeability and that of producing antibodies to enteric <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> antigens are both important for the pathogenesis of IBD, and that the characteristics of CD and UC differ </plain></SENT>
