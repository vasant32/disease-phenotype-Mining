<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One thousand and six New Zealand Caucasian cases and 540 Caucasian controls were genotyped for the MIF SNP -173G &gt; C (rs755622) and the repeat polymorphism CATT₅₋₈ (rs5844572) using a pre-designed TaqMan SNP assay and capillary electrophoresis, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were analysed for single site and haplotype association with IBD risk and phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis was employed, to assess cumulative evidence of association of MIF -173G &gt; C with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> published genotype data for MIF -173G &gt; C in IBD were identified using PubMed and subsequently searching the references of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> PubMed-identified studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Imputed genotypes for MIF -173G &gt; C were generated from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (and National Institute of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and Digestive and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Kidney Diseases</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Separate meta-analyses were performed on Caucasian <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) (3863 patients, 6031 controls), Caucasian <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) (1260 patients, 1987 controls), and East Asian UC (416 patients and 789 controls) datasets using the Mantel-Haenszel method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The New Zealand dataset had 93% power, and the meta-analyses had 100% power to detect an effect size of OR = 1.40 at α = 0.05, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In our New Zealand dataset, single-site analysis found no evidence of association of MIF polymorphisms with overall risk of CD, UC, and IBD or disease phenotype (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P values &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis found the CATT₅/-173C haplotype occurred at a higher frequency in New Zealand controls compared to IBD patients (0.6 vs 0.01; P = 0.03, OR = 0.22; 95%CI: 0.05-0.99), but this association did not survive bonferroni correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis of our New Zealand MIF -173G &gt; C data with data from seven additional Caucasian datasets using a random effects model found no association of MIF polymorphisms with CD, UC, or overall IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Similarly, meta-analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> published MIF -173G &gt; C data from East Asian datasets (416 UC patients, 789 controls) found no association of this promoter polymorphism with UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found no evidence of association of MIF promoter polymorphisms with IBD </plain></SENT>
