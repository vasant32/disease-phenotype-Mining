<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory alterations and fragility of the bowel and mesentery, however, may demand a high level of laparoscopic experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A broad spectrum of operations from the rather easy enterostomy formation for anal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) to restorative proctocolectomies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) may be managed laparoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The current evidence base for the use of laparoscopic techniques in the surgical therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD limited to the terminal ileum has become a common indication for laparoscopic surgical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In severe anal CD, laparoscopic stoma formation is a standard procedure with low morbidity and short operative time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Studies comparing conventional and laparoscopic bowel resections, have found shorter times to first postoperative bowel movements and shorter hospital stays as well as lower complication rates in favour of the laparoscopic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Even complicated cases with previous surgery, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> formation and enteric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> may be operated on laparoscopically with a low morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In UC, restorative proctocolectomy is the standard procedure in elective surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The demanding laparoscopic approach is increasingly used, however, mainly in major centers; its feasibility has been proven in various studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An <z:mp ids='MP_0006087'>increased body mass index</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of the bowel may be relative contraindications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Short and long-term outcomes like quality of life seem to be equivalent for open and laparoscopic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multiple studies have proven that the laparoscopic approach to CD and UC is a safe and successful alternative for selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The appropriate selection criteria are still under investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Technical considerations are playing an important role for the complexity of both diseases </plain></SENT>
