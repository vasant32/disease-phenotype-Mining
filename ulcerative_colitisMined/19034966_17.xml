<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Economic analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases is required for proper allocation of resources and understanding cost-effectiveness studies of new therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies on health care cost of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) are reviewed here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These studies were carried out in various countries with disparate health care systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the United States, data were often modeled or retrieved from large insurance schemes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgery and in-patient hospitalization accounted for over half the outlay on UC and CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fistulous disease in CD and parenteral nutrition were very costly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Canada, overall charges were lower than in the United States, but there too, surgical costs were relatively high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In European studies, economic data were abstracted directly from patients' files </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One pan-European study examined the outlay on UC and CD in a community-based prospective inception cohort followed for 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall costs in Europe were lower than in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Surgery, hospitalization, year of follow-up, disease phenotype in CD and ASCA-positivity impacted significantly on costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies, the cost data were right skewed, aminosalicylates were expensive drugs, and biological agents the most expensive; moreover indirect costs were not calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Infliximab raised costs considerably in CD, but there were no long-term follow-up studies, so that the cost-benefit of biological agents remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, costs of managing UC and CD vary by country, surgery, genotype and several other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The most important question for further research is whether the biological therapies are cost-effective in the long-term </plain></SENT>
