<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the quality of care for a hospital based-cohort of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) from East China according to the current practice guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted, involving 177 patients with IBD admitted to Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University between June 2000 and June 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data regarding demographic and clinical characteristics as well as medical therapy including use of oral aminosalisylates, topical therapy, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> agents, immunomodulatory agents (such as <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>) at admission and outpatient clinic visit were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 177 eligible patients were evaluated in this study, including 71 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and 106 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were the Han nationality Chinese with active disease at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the 106 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> received optimal doses of aminosalisylate while 27 of 68 (39.7%) patients with ileal or colonic CD received the suboptimal doses of aminosalisylate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of suboptimal dose of aminosalisylate was significantly higher in CD patients with small intestine involvement only (52.8% vs 25.0%, P=0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one (54.4%) patients with active distal or left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> received topical therapy, and 27.8% of patients suffering from severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> did not receive oral or intravenous steroid therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the 51 patients for whom <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> was indicated, only 10 (19.6%) received immunomodulatory agents, and more than half of the 8 patients received a suboptimal dose of azathiopurine with no attempt to increase its dosage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The quality of care for IBD patients can be further improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A suboptimal dose of aminosalicylate is used in treatment of patients with CD, especially in those with small intestine involved only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Topical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> is inadequately used in patients with distal or left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Oral or intravenous steroid therapy is not used in some patients with severe IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Use of immunomodulatory medication is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Larger prospective studies are needed to investigate the quality of care for patients with IBD to establish our own evidence-based guidelines </plain></SENT>
