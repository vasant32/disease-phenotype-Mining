<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Outpatient visits with clinical examination, sigmoidoscopy, and biopsy were supplemented by two-yearly colonoscopy after the disease course reached 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the 22 year period from the beginning of 1966 to the end of 1987, 401 patients entered the programme and together contributed 4048 patient-years of observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Apart from nine patients who left the country, follow up is complete until 1986 or 1987 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> developed in 22 patients and, in a further 12, biopsy evidence of precancer, described as severe/high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, was confirmed in a colectomy specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cumulative probability of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was 3% at 15 years, 5% at 20 years, and 9% at 25 years; corresponding figures for precancer or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, or both were 4%, 7%, and 13% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five patients died of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, two while under regular observation and three after developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> four to six years after their last attendance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 17 patients who developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> while under observation, the Dukes stage was A or B in 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> whose disability does not warrant early surgery have a clinically important <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk after the disease has been present for 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that follow up in the manner described reduces the mortality from this complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further work is needed to define the optimum method of surveillance and show if it is cost effective </plain></SENT>
