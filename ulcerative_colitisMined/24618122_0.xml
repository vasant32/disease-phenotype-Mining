<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is an accurate tool for assessing inflammatory activity in UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to evaluate whether CLE could be used to predict UC relapse reliably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In total, forty-three patients with documented UC were analyzed in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients identified as having obvious active <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> by conventional colonoscopy were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mucosa of each patient's sigmoid colon and rectum was assessed by CLE before targeted biopsies were taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients were then followed up for at least 12 months to evaluate relapse according to the Simple Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>Colitis</z:hpo> Activity Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The correlation between CLE classification and UC relapse was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen of 20 patients with histologically confirmed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> were diagnosed as having non-active <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> by real-time CLE and 22 of 23 patients with histologically confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> were diagnosed as having active <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> by CLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CLE in real-time diagnosis of active <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> were 95.7%, 85%, and 90.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The agreement between CLE and conventional histology was excellent (kappa value = 0.812) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two of 18 (11.1%) patients who were classified as having non-active <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> by CLE relapsed, while 16 of 25 (64%) patients classified as having as active <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The relapse rate of patients with active <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was significantly higher than of those with non-active <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CLE is comparable to conventional histology in predicting relapse in patients with UC </plain></SENT>
