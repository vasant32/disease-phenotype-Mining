<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of the B lymphocyte (anti-CD20) antibody, rituximab, in the treatment of steroid-resistant moderately active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A double-blinded, randomised controlled trial with a 2:1 ratio of treatment:placebo (phase II) was carried out in the setting of a University teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subjects comprised 24 patients with moderately active UC who have either failed to respond to conventional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy or who have relapsed during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> withdrawal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five of 8 placebo-treated patients and 12 of 16 rituximab-treated patients were receiving <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50667">6-mercaptopurine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two infusions of rituximab 1 g in 500 ml of 0.9% saline intravenously over 4 h (n=16) or saline placebo (n=8) were given at 0 and 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients still receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> on entry (placebo group 7/8; rituximab group 14/16) continued a standard steroid tapering regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was remission (Mayo score ≤ 2) at 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points included response (Mayo score reduced ≥ 3) at 4 and 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mayo score at entry was higher in rituximab-treated patients (mean 9.19; 95% CI 8.31 to 10.06) than for placebo patients (7.63; 6.63 to 8.62, p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At week 4 only 1/8 placebo-treated patients and 3/16 rituximab-treated patients were in remission (p=1.0), but 8/16 rituximab-treated patients had responded compared with 2/8 placebo-treated patients, with a median reduction in Mayo score of 2.5 (rituximab) compared with 0 (placebo; p=0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This response was only maintained to week 12 in 4/16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mucosal healing was seen at week 4 in 5/16 rituximab-treated patients and 2/8 placebo-treated patients (non-significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Rituximab was well tolerated, with one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149725" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="LRTI">chest infection</z:e>, three mild infusion reactions plus one case of (probably unrelated) non-fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Rituximab has no significant effect on inducing remission in moderately active UC not responding to oral steroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was a possible short-term response that was not sustained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Rituximab is well tolerated in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: NCT00261118 </plain></SENT>
