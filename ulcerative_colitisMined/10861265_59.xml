<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Degradation of the extracellular matrix and ulceration of the mucosa are major features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the most important enzymes in degrading the matrix and produced in excess by cytokine activated stromal cells, is stromelysin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The activity of stromelysin-1 is controlled by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1), its natural inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In model systems excess stromelysin-1 produces mucosal degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Quantitative competitive RT-PCR was used to analyse stromelysin-1 and TIMP-1 transcripts; western blotting was used to measure the amount of stromelysin-1 and TIMP-1 protein in biopsy samples from children with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In biopsies from patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (n=24), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (n=23), and controls (n=16), TIMP-1 transcripts and protein were abundant and unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stromelysin-1 transcripts and protein were markedly elevated in mucosal biopsies obtained from inflamed sites of patients with active IBD but were not elevated in adjacent endoscopically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa (n=10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels of stromelysin-1 transcripts in active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (n=5) returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels following treatment with enteral nutrition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Stromelysin-1 is markedly overexpressed at inflamed sites in patients with IBD whereas TIMP-1 remains unaltered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Excess stromelysin-1 is likely to be responsible for loss of mucosal integrity in IBD </plain></SENT>
