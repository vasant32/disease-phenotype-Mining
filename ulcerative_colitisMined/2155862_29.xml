<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of 5-aminosalicyclic acid (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>) on the cell injury mediated by activated neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used a system constituted of neutrophils, triggered with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi>-labelled Daudi cells as targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> is capable of efficiently preventing neutrophil-mediated lysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> was up to 10-fold more effective than <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi>, which acts as an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24757">hypochlorous acid</z:chebi> scavenger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> was found to compete with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> for the neutrophil derived <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24757">hypochlorous acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results are consistent with the conclusion that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> is capable of limiting the neutrophil mediated cell damage by scavenging the generated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24757">hypochlorous acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This may represent a potential mechanism for the therapeutic action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
