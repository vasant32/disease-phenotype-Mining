<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Using standard diagnostic algorithms it is not always possible to establish the correct phenotype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> which is essential for therapeutical decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic ultrasound elastography is a new endoscopic procedure which can differentiate the stiffness of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathological tissue by ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we aimed to investigate the role of transrectal ultrasound elastography in distiction between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total 30 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 25 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and 28 non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> controls were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transrectal ultrasound elastography was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ulcerative coltis patients and 80% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients endoscopy was performed to assess disease activity in the rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant difference in rectal wall thickness and strain ratio was detected between patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and controls (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD patients with active disease had higher strain ratio than patients in remission (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> group a significant difference in rectal wall thickness was found between controls and patients with active disease (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant difference in rectal wall thickness (p = 0.02) and strain ratio (p = 0.0001) was detected between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients with active disease had a significantly higher strain ratio compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients with active disease (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Transrectal ultrasound elastography seems to be a promising new diagnostic tool in the field of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further study on a larger cohort of patients is needed to definitely assess the role of transrectal ultrasound elastography in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
