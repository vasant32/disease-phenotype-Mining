<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Adsorptive granulocyte and monocyte apheresis (GMA) with an Adacolumn in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) has been applied as a non-pharmacological treatment strategy, but the efficacy has been encouraging as well as discouraging, depending on patients' demography at entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we looked for predictive factors for clinical response to GMA in patients with UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a retrospective setting, 43 outpatients who had been treated with GMA for active UC were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into remission group and non-remission group based on Lichtiger's clinical activity index (CAI) before and after 10, once a week GMA sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The efficacy was analysed in relation to patients' demographic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine predictive factors that closely related to the response to GMA, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and multiple logistic regression analyses were applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 10 GMA sessions, the overall clinical remission rate (CAI &lt; 4) was 53.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression and ROC analyses showed that the interval between relapse and the first GMA session was a significant and independent predictive factor for clinical response to GMA (P = 0.016); the clinical response was better in patients who received GMA immediately after a relapse and vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Likewise, univariate analyses showed that, the duration of UC (P = 0.036) and the cumulative <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> (PSL) dose (P = 0.006) before the first GMA session were significantly greater in the GMA non-responder group as compared with the responder group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a lower white blood cell (WBC) count at first GMA session was related to clinical response to GMA (P = 0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, patients with a short duration of UC and low cumulative PSL dose seemed to respond well to GMA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, we found that the best responders were patients who received GMA immediately after a clinical relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additionally, GMA was effective in patients with low WBC count at the first GMA session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The findings of this study should spare medical cost and reduce morbidity time for many patients, relevant for decision making in clinical settings </plain></SENT>
