<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the frequency of NOD2, IL23R and ATG16L1 genetic variants in a case-control panel for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) from Lithuania </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and eighty unrelated IBD patients [57 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and 123 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC)] and 186 healthy controls were genotyped for the following known genetic susceptibility variants: NOD2 - Arg702Trp (rs2066844), Gly908Arg (rs2066845) and Leu1007insC (rs2066847), as well as IL23R - Arg381Gln (rs11209026) and ATG16L1 - Thr300Ala (rs2241880) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The effect that carriership of at least one NOD2 risk allele predisposes to CD was replicated in the Lithuanian population (41.1% CD vs 16.9% controls, P = 2 x 10(-4), OR = 3.48, 95% CI: 1.81-6.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the allelic single marker analysis, Leu1007insC was strongly associated with CD (21.4% CD vs 4.7% controls, P = 3.687 x 10(-8), OR = 5.54, 95% CI: 2.85-10.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither the other two NOD2 variants, nor the known variants in IL23R and ATG16L1 were found to be risk factors for CD, UC or IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, our relatively small study population was underpowered to demonstrate such weak to moderate disease associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results support a strong association between CD susceptibility and the Leu1007insC variant in NOD2 in the Lithuanian study population </plain></SENT>
