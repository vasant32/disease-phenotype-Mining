<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This case illustrates an unusual adverse reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our patient developed an isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> of unexplained etiology, which was found to be related to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalamine</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 22-year-old patient diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> with rigors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo> 10 d after starting oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalamine</z:chebi> while his <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> was clinically resolving </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalamine</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> was considered, and treatment was stopped, which led to spontaneous resolution of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was confirmed by reintroducing the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
