<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of an enema formulation of alicaforsen, an antisense inhibitor of intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule, after 1, 3, and 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a randomised, placebo controlled, double blind, escalating dose multicentre study in 40 patients with mild to moderately active distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (disease activity index (DAI) 4-10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were assigned to four dosing cohorts of 10 patients each (eight active, two placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each patient received 60 ml of alicaforsen enema (0.1, 0.5, 2, or 4 mg/ml or placebo) once daily for 28 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Safety and efficacy (DAI and clinical activity index) scores were evaluated up to six months after initiation of dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At day 29, alicaforsen enema resulted in dose dependent improvement in DAI (overall p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Alicaforsen 4 mg/ml improved DAI by 70% compared with the placebo response of 28% (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Alicaforsen 2 and 4 mg/ml improved DAI status by 72% and 68% compared with a placebo response of 11.5% at month 3 (p = 0.016 and 0.021, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Specifically, DAI improved from 5.6 to 1.6 and from 6.3 to 2.5 in the 2 and 4 mg/ml groups compared with placebo (7.5 to 6.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the patients in the 4 mg/ml group compared with 4/8 placebo patients required additional medical or surgical intervention over baseline during the six month period after starting the enema treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The safety profile was favourable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Alicaforsen enema showed promising <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and long term benefit in patients with mild to moderate descending <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Alicaforsen enemas had a favourable safety profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings require verification in larger randomised controlled clinical trials </plain></SENT>
