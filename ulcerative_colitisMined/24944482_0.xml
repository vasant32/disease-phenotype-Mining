<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum concentrations of six adipokines (tissue growth factor-β1, adiponectin, leptin, chemerin, resistin, and visfatin) were studied in 40 subjects with active IBD [24 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and in 16 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC)] before and after three months of therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and/or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical diagnoses were based on ileocolonoscopy, computed tomography or magnetic resonance enterography and histological examination of mucosal biopsies sampled during endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of adipokines were assessed by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The control group was comprised of 16 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline leptin concentrations were significantly decreased in both types of IBD compared to controls (8.0 ± 9.1 in CD and 8.6 ± 6.3 in UC vs 16.5 ± 10.1 ng/mL in controls; P &lt; 0.05), and significantly increased after treatment only in subjects with CD (14.9 ± 15.1 ng/mL; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline serum resistin concentrations were significantly higher in CD (19.3 ± 12.5 ng/mL; P &lt; 0.05) and UC subjects (23.2 ± 11.0 ng/mL; P &lt; 0.05) than in healthy controls (10.7 ± 1.1 ng/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment induced a decrease in the serum resistin concentration only in UC subjects (14.5 ± 4.0 ng/mL; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Baseline serum concentrations of visfatin were significantly higher in subjects with CD (23.2 ± 3.2 ng/mL; P &lt; 0.05) and UC (18.8 ± 5.3 ng/mL; P &lt; 0.05) than in healthy controls (14.1 ± 5.3 ng/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment induced a decrease in the serum visfatin concentrations only in CD subjects (20.4 ± 4.8 ng/mL; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of adiponectin, chemerin and tissue growth factor-β1 did not differ between CD and UC subjects compared to healthy controls and also were not altered by anti-inflammatory therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Clinical indices of IBD activity did not correlate with adipokine levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IBD modulates serum adipokine levels by increasing resistin and visfatin release and suppressing leptin production </plain></SENT>
