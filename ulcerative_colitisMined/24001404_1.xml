<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">Acetic acid</z:chebi> (AA)-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> is a reproducible and simple model, sharing many characteristics with human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">N-acetylcysteine</z:chebi> (NAC) has been widely used as an <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NAC can affect several signaling pathways involving in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, cell growth and arrest, redox-regulated gene expression, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, NAC may not only protect against the direct injurious effects of oxidants, but also beneficially alter inflammatory events in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to investigate whether NAC could alleviate the AA-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in a porcine model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Weaned piglets were used to investigate the effects of NAC on AA-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> was evaluated by colon histomorphology measurements, histopathology scores, tissue myeloperoxidase activity, as well as concentrations of malondialdehyde and pro-<z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> in the plasma and colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The protective role of NAC was assessed by measurements of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> status, growth modulator, cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and tight junction proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Abundances of caspase-3 and claudin-1 proteins in colonic mucosae were determined by the Western blot method </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the control group, AA treatment increased (P &lt; 0.05) the histopathology scores, intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) numbers and density in the colon, myeloperoxidase activity, the concentrations of malondialdehyde and pro-<z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> in the plasma and colon, while reducing (P &lt; 0.05) goblet cell numbers and the protein/DNA ratio in the colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These adverse effects of AA were partially ameliorated (P &lt; 0.05) by dietary supplementation with NAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, NAC prevented the AA-induced increase in caspase-3 protein, while stimulating claudin-1 protein expression in the colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Moreover, NAC enhanced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels for epidermal growth factor and amphiregulin in the colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Dietary supplementation with NAC can alleviate AA-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in a porcine model through regulating anti-oxidative responses, cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and EGF gene expression </plain></SENT>
