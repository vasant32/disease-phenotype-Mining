<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The nine hour overnight urinary excretion of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethyleneglycol</z:chebi>-400 (<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-400) and three inert <z:chebi fb="96" ids="16646">sugars</z:chebi> (lactulose, l-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26546">rhamnose</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>) was used to test the permeation in 47 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> of whom 18 had at least one first degree relative with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (2BD) and 52 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> of whom 16 had at least one first degree relative with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 17 first degree relatives with IBD and 56 healthy first degree relatives were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty one healthy subjects not related to patients with IBD served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-400 permeation were found between the groups of patients, relatives, and controls, or between diseased and healthy relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The permeability to lactulose, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26546">rhamnose</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> similarly did not differ between the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study challenges the previously reported findings of increased <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-400 permeation in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and in their healthy and diseased first degree relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no increase in permeability in a similar group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients and their families </plain></SENT>
