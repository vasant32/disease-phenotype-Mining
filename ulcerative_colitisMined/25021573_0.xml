<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Interleukin (IL)-17A, which is up-regulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) mucosal lesions, and IL-17F are normally present as IL-17AA and IL-17FF homodimers and may occasionally form IL-17A/F heterodimers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of each IL-17 dimer in IBD is currently unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we studied the effects of IL-17AA, IL-17FF and IL-17-A/F in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Inflamed colonic biopsies from 17 IBD patients (6 UC and 11 CD) were cultured ex vivo for 24 h with IL-17AA, IL-17FF or IL-17A/F (1 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mucosal myofibroblasts isolated from the inflamed colon of 4 CD and 4 UC patients were cultured for 24 h with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-α 20 ng/ml or with increasing concentrations (1-100 ng/ml) of IL-17AA, IL-17FF or IL-17A/F </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IL-6 and IL-8 were measured in culture supernatants by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IL-17AA, but not IL-17FF, significantly reduced both IL-6 and IL-8 production by inflamed IBD biopsies cultured ex vivo , whereas IL-17A/F decreased IL-8 release by IBD mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No difference was observed between CD and UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither IL-17AA, nor IL-17FF, nor IL-17A/F exerted any effect on IL-6 and IL-8 production by IBD myofibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As expected, TNF-α stimulation significantly increased IL-6 and IL-8 production by both CD and UC myofibroblasts in vitro  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No difference was observed between CD and UC myofibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IL-17AA exerts an anti-inflammatory action on inflamed IBD biopsies cultured ex vivo  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The action of IL-17AA is not mediated by myofibroblasts, therefore further studies are underway to ascertain which cell type is the main target of IL-17AA in IBD mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>DISCLOSURE OF INTEREST: None Declared </plain></SENT>
