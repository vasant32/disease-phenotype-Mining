<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha, interleukin 6, and interferon gamma, as well as activation of proinflammatory signalling molecules such as nuclear factor kappa B, is characteristic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To investigate expression and activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 in patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Patients with active IBD (n=42), disease specificity controls (n=8), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (n=12) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Expression and activation of STAT1 were assessed by western blotting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays in extracts of endoscopic colonic biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cellular localisation was determined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Western blots and immunohistochemical staining revealed an increase in STAT1 expression and activation in mucosal samples from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and to a lesser extend in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High levels of suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS)-3 expression, an inhibitor of STAT activation, were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls in western blot experiments whereas no differences were observed for SOCS-1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylated (p) STAT1 was mainly detected in monocytic cells and neutrophils in the inflamed mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Induction of remission by systemic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> led to a decrease in levels of pSTAT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies indicated a direct effect of steroid treatment on STAT1 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Expression and activation of STAT1 are predominantly heightened in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and may therefore play an important role in the pathophysiology of colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
