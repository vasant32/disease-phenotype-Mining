<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After colonoscopy, polymers of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>) with molecular weights of 414-810 (mean 600), were instilled in the descending colon of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (n = 17) and in controls without <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (n = 6) had a significantly increased uptake of <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEGs</z:chebi> in the molecular weight range 458-810, measured as urinary excretion over the first 6 hours after instillation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median values for their excretion were 2.85-3.80% of <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEGs</z:chebi> instilled compared with 0.32-0.94% for patients in remission (n = 11) (p &lt; 0.05-0.01) and 0.17-0.60% for the controls (p &lt; 0.05-0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The differences in absorption of <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> 414 did not reach the present level of statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a positive correlation between <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> absorption and the endoscopic and histological grading of inflammatory activity in the sigmoid colon (p &lt; 0.01-0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings support a correlation between the presence of active <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> absorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was little evidence to support the presence of a primary defect in the colonic barrier in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
