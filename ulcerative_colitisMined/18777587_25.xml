<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Serological biomarkers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) are a rapidly expanding list of non-invasive tests for objective assessments of disease activity, early diagnosis, prognosis evaluation and surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This review summarizes both old and new biomarkers in IBD, but focuses on the development and characterization of new serological biomarkers (identified since 2007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These include five new anti-glycan antibodies, anti-chitobioside IgA (ACCA), anti-laminaribioside IgG (ALCA), anti-manobioside IgG (AMCA), and antibodies against chemically synthesized (Sigma) two major oligomannose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi>, Man alpha-1,3 Man alpha-1,2 Man (SigmaMan3) and Man alpha-1,3 Man alpha-1,2 Man alpha-1,2 Man (SigmaMan4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These new biomarkers serve as valuable complementary tools to existing biomarkers not only in differentiating <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and other non-IBD gut diseases, but also in predicting disease involvement (ileum vs colon), IBD risk (as subclinical biomarkers), and disease course (risk of complication and surgery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the prevalence of the antiglycan antibodies, including anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA), ALCA and AMCA, was found to be associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IBD susceptible genes such as NOD2/CARD15, NOD1/CARD4, toll-like receptors (TLR) 2 and 4, and beta-defensin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a gene dosage effect was observed: anti-glycan positivity became more frequent as the number of NOD2/CARD15 SNPS increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other new serum/plasma IBD biomarkers reviewed include ubiquitination factor E4A (UBE4A), CXCL16 (a chemokine), resistin, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This review also discusses the most recent studies in IBD biomarker discovery by the application of new technologies such as proteomics, fourier transform near-infrared spectroscopy, and multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)'s (with an emphasis on cytokine/chemokine profiling) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, the prospects of developing more clinically useful novel diagnostic algorithms by incorporating new technologies in serological biomarker profiling and integrating multiple biomarkers with bioinformatics analysis/modeling are also discussed </plain></SENT>
