<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: The immunosuppressive properties of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50667">6-mercaptopurine</z:chebi> and its parent compound <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> are mediated by their intracellular metabolism into active 6-thioguanine (6-TG) metabolites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Measurement of erythrocyte 6-TG metabolite levels has been proposed as a useful clinical tool for assessing treatment efficacy in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: The purpose of the study was to establish a therapeutic index of treatment efficacy based on measurement of erythrocyte 6-TG metabolite levels, and apply it clinically to guide therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Heparinised blood was obtained from 82 adult patients with IBD on long term (more than three months) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35221">antimetabolite</z:chebi> therapy (63 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>; 19 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Erythrocyte 6-TG metabolite levels were measured using reverse phase high performance chromatography, and correlated with treatment efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 22 patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> despite long term <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> therapy, their dosage was increased by 25 mg/day at eight week intervals as needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serial erythrocyte 6-TG metabolite levels were measured at each clinic visit and correlated with treatment efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinical remission, as defined by a low disease index score in patients weaned off or on a low alternate day dose (&lt;20 mg on alternate days) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi>, was achieved in 68% of patients on long term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35221">antimetabolite</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment efficacy correlated with erythrocyte 6-TG levels greater than 250 pmol/8x10(8) red blood cells in patients with colonic and fistulising <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (p&lt;0.01) but not in patients with ileocolonic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eighteen of 22 patients with incompletely responsive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> achieved disease remission by optimising their dose of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median (range) erythrocyte 6-TG metabolite levels increased from 194 (67-688) to 303 (67-737) pmol/8x10(8) red blood cells (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Clinical response associated well with a reduction in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> requirements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mean (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) white blood cell count decreased from 8.6 (0.9) to 6.9 (0.6) x10(3)/microl with adjustment in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> dosage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No patient incurred <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leucopenia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Measurement of erythrocyte 6-TG metabolite levels is helpful in determining the adequacy of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> dosage and can be used to optimise the dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35221">antimetabolite</z:chebi> therapy to achieve an improved clinical response without inducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leucopenia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients who are clinically refractory to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> therapy despite achieving high erythrocyte 6-TG levels (&gt;250) should be considered for adjunct or alternative forms of immunosuppressive therapy or surgery </plain></SENT>
