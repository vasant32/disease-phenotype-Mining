<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study compared the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3207">budesonide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53464">MMX</z:chebi> with placebo in patients with active, mild-to-moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Patients were randomised 1:1:1:1 to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3207">budesonide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53464">MMX</z:chebi> 9 mg or 6 mg, or Entocort EC 9 mg (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="3207">budesonide</z:chebi> controlled ileal-release capsules; reference arm) or placebo once daily for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was combined clinical and endoscopic remission, defined as UC Disease Activity Index score ≤1 with a score of 0 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> and stool frequency, no mucosal friability on colonoscopy, and a ≥1-point reduction in endoscopic index score from baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 410 patients were evaluated for efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combined clinical and endoscopic remission rates with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3207">budesonide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53464">MMX</z:chebi> 9 mg or 6 mg, Entocort EC and placebo were 17.4%, 8.3%, 12.6% and 4.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3207">budesonide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53464">MMX</z:chebi> 9 mg and placebo was significant (OR 4.49; 95% CI 1.47 to 13.72; p=0.0047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3207">Budesonide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53464">MMX</z:chebi> 9 mg was associated with numerically higher rates of clinical (42.2% vs 33.7%) and endoscopic improvement (42.2% vs 31.5%) versus placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rate of histological healing (16.5% vs 6.7%; p=0.0361) and proportion of patients with symptom resolution (23.9% vs 11.2%; p=0.0220) were significantly higher for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3207">budesonide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53464">MMX</z:chebi> 9 mg than placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adverse event profiles were similar across groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3207">Budesonide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53464">MMX</z:chebi> 9 mg was safe and more effective than placebo at inducing combined clinical and endoscopic remission in patients with active, mild-to-moderate UC </plain></SENT>
