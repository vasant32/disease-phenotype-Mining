<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to assess HRQoL in a population of 135 Greek patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort of 135 patients with IBD, 81 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and 54 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) were enrolled in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic and disease-related data were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HRQoL was assessed by a disease-specific and a generic questionnaire, IBDQ and SF-36, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was assessed by Harvey-Bradshaw Index and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>Colitis</z:hpo> Activity Index for CD and UC patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> variables recorded in our study, only disease activity had a significant effect on HRQoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with active disease scored significantly lower on both IBDQ and SF-36 when compared to those in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only two among the four IBDQ dimensions, bowel and systemic, had significant ability in distinguishing best patients in remission from those with active disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IBD has a negative impact on HRQoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with active disease are more impaired than patients in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In our population of patients bowel and systemic dimensions had a predominant value in patients' perception of quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients in our study using the same instrument scored higher than previously reported </plain></SENT>
