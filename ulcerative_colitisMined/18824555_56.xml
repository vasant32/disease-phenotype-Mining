<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> have a complex genetic background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the risk for both the development and severity of the disease by combining information from genetic variants associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 2804 patients (1684 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and 1120 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>) and 1350 controls from seven university hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Details of the phenotype were available for 1600 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and for 800 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genetic association for disease susceptibility was tested for the nucleotide-binding and oligomerisation domain 2 gene (NOD2), the IBD5 locus, the Drosophila discs large homologue 5 and autophagy-related 16-like 1 genes (DLG5 and ATG16L1) and the interleukin 23 receptor gene (IL23R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interaction analysis was performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> using the most associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for each locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios were calculated in an ordinal regression analysis with the number of risk alleles as an independent variable to analyse disease development and severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> was confirmed for NOD2, IBD5, DLG5, ATG16L1 and IL23R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> carry more risk alleles than controls (p = 3.85 x 10(-22)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Individuals carrying an increasing number of risk alleles have an increasing risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, consistent with an independent effects multiplicative model (trend analysis p = 4.25 x 10(-23)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> with a more severe disease course, operations or an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> below 40 years have more risk alleles compared to non-stricturing, non-penetrating behaviour (p = 0.0008), no operations (p = 0.02) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> above 40 years (p = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> is a multigenic disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An increase in the number of risk alleles is associated with an increased risk for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and with a more severe disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Combining information from the known common risk polymorphisms may enable clinicians to predict the course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
