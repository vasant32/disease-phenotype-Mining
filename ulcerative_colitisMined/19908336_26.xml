<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-one adolescents (mean age 15 years, SD+/-4.13) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intestinal biopsies from inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa of IBD patients and from controls with functional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> were cultured under aerobic and anaerobic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of microbes belonging to the same group was calculated per weight of collected tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mucus thickness in frozen samples was measured under a fluorescent microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ratios of different <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> groups in inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa of IBD patients and controls were specific for particular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Streptococcus spp. were predominant in the inflamed mucosa of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) patients (80% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> bacteria), and Lactobacillus spp. were predominant in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients (90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The differences were statistically significant (P=0.01-0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lower number of bifidobacteria was observed in the whole IBD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A relation was also found between clinical and endoscopic severity and decreased numbers of Lactobacillus and, to a lesser extent, of Streptococcus in biopsies from CD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mucus layer in the inflamed sites was significantly thinner as compared to controls (P=0.0033) and to non-inflamed areas in IBD patients (P=0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The significantly thinner mucosa of IBD patients showed a predominance of some aerobes specific for particular diseases, their numbers decreased in relation to higher clinical and endoscopic activity of the disease </plain></SENT>
