<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Altered SERT function or expression may underlie the altered motility, secretion, and sensation seen in these inflammatory gut disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In an effort to elucidate possible mediators of SERT downregulation, we treated cultured colonic epithelial cells (Caco2) with conditioned medium from activated human lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Application of the conditioned medium caused a decrease in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi>-sensitive [(3)H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individual proinflammatory agents were then tested for their ability to affect uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cells were treated for 48 or 72 h with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) (10 microM), IFN-gamma (500 ng/ml), TNF-alpha (50 ng/ml), IL-12 (50 ng/ml), or the nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>-releasing agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">S-nitrosoglutathione</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi>; 100 microM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>[(3)H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> uptake was then measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi> nor IL-12 had any effect on [(3)H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> uptake, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi> increased uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, after 3-day incubation, both TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma elicited significant decreases in SERT function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neither TNF-alpha nor IFN-gamma were cytotoxic when used for this period of time and at these concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These two cytokines also induced decreases in SERT <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>By altering SERT expression, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma could contribute to the altered motility and expression seen in vivo in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022104" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IBS">irritable bowel syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
