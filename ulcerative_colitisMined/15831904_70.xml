<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Several <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory conditions are associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether this applies to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) is still unclear but of paramount interest, particularly in the safety evaluation of newer immunosuppressive drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reports also indicate a possible increase in the risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> in IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore assessed the risk of haematopoietic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in a large cohort of patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects and METHODS: We performed a population based cohort study using prospectively recorded data, including 47 679 Swedish patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) assembled from regional cohorts of IBD from 1955 to 1990 (n = 8028) and from the Inpatient Register of 1964-2000 (n = 45 060), with follow up until 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relative risks were expressed as standardised incidence ratios (SIR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, we observed 264 haematopoietic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> during follow up, which corresponded to a borderline significant 20% increased risk in both UC and CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In UC, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> occurred as expected (SIR 1.0, n = 87) but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> occurred significantly more often than expected (SIR 1.8, n = 32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In CD, there was a borderline significant increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> risk (SIR 1.3, n = 65), essentially confined to the first years of follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Proxy markers of disease activity had little impact on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: On average, patients with IBD have a marginally increased risk of haematopoietic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In UC, this is accounted for by an excess of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In CD, a modest short term increase in the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of unknown significance cannot be excluded but any long term risk increase seems unlikely </plain></SENT>
