<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>UC is an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in UC is mediated by a buildup of white blood cells (WBCs) within the colonic mucosal lining; however, to date there is no answer for why WBCs initially enter the colonic mucosa to begin with </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A new pathogenesis termed "Radical Induction Theory" is proposed to explain this and states that excess un-neutralized <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi>, produced within colonic epithelial cells as a result of aberrant cellular metabolism, diffuses through cell membranes to the extracellular space where it is converted to the highly damaging <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radical</z:chebi> resulting in oxidative damage to structures comprising the colonic epithelial barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Once damaged, the barrier is unable to exclude highly immunogenic fecal <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> antigens from invading the normally <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> submucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This antigenic exposure provokes an initial immune response of WBC infiltration into the colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Once present in the mucosa, WBCs are stimulated to secrete toxins by direct exposure to fecal bacteria leading to mucosal ulceration and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>bloody diarrhea</z:hpo> characteristic of this disease </plain></SENT>
