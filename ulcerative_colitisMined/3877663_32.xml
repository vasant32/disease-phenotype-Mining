<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Plasma 25-(OH)D3 and the dihydroxylated metabolites, 24,25-(OH)2D3 and 1,25-(OH)2D3 were measured in the summer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results were related to clinical and biochemical parameters and also compared with results from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and healthy subjects who served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma 25-(OH)D3 was reduced in the undernourished Crohn's group compared with the well nourished Crohn's group, who did not differ from the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Over 50% of the undernourished Crohn's group had evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000867'>secondary hyperparathyroidism</z:hpo> and raised alkaline phosphatase concentrations, although concentrations of 1,25-(OH)2D3 were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The low 25-(OH)D3 concentrations related to disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that undernourished Crohn's patients who have high levels of disease activity are at risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100512'>vitamin D deficiency</z:hpo>, and attempts should be made to improve their <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> nutrition </plain></SENT>
