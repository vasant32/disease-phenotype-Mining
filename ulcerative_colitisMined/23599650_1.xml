<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the expression of epithelial markers of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> in patients with long-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> (PSC) before and after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight patients with UC and PSC prior to liver transplantation (PSC-UC), 22 patients with UC after liver transplantation for PSC (OLT), 9 patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> without PSC (UCA), 7 patients with UC in remission (UCR) and 10 controls (N) underwent colonoscopy with multiple biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specimens were analysed histologically and semi-quantitatively immunohistochemically for p53, Bcl-2 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed by Kruskal-Wallis and Fisher's exact tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PSC-UC had a statistically significantly higher expression of p53 in the nondysplastic mucosa as compared to OLT, UCA, UCR and N (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also found a statistically significant positive correlation between the incidence of PSC and the expression of p53 (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>UCA had a higher p53 expression as compared to UCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>OLT had a significantly lower expression of p53 as compared with PSC-UC (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 had a significant higher bcl-2 expression as compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No difference in COX-2 expression between PSC-UC, UCR and UCA was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>UCA had higher COX-2 expression as compared to UCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We also found a statistically significant positive correlation between the expression of COX-2 and p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients after liver transplantation for PSC had a statistically significantly lower expression of the p53 compared with PSC-UC (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>PSC-UC had the same inflammatory endoscopic activity as OLT and UCR when evaluated with the Mayo score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the nondysplatic mucosa of UC patients with PSC is characterised by a higher expression of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressor gene p53, suggesting a higher susceptibility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This p53 overexpression correlates with the presence of PSC whilst it is not present in patients with UC after liver transplantation for PSC </plain></SENT>
