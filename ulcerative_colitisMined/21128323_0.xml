<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: five hundred and seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) patients, 474 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) patients, and 569 healthy controls were genotyped for SLC11A1 1730G&gt;A and SLC11A1 469+14G&gt;C using pre-designed TaqMan SNP assays. Ï‡(2) tests were applied to test for association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with disease, and the presence of MAP DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SLC11A1 1730G&gt;A and SLC11A 1469+14G&gt;C were not associated with CD, UC, or IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The SLC11A1 1730A minor allele was over-represented in patients who did not require immunomodulator therapy (P = 0.002, OR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.13-0.66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the SLC11A1 469+14C allele was higher in the subset of study participants who tested positive for MAP DNA (P = 0.02, OR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.06-2.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No association of SLC11A1 1730G&gt;A with MAP was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although SLC11A1 was not associated with IBD, association with MAP suggests that SLC11A1 is important in determining susceptibility to bacteria implicated in the etiology of CD </plain></SENT>
