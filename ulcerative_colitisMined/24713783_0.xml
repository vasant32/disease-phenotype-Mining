<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine the efficacy of infliximab in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e>, following ileo-pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven patients (4 females, 3 males) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> were included in an open study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pouchitis</z:e> was diagnosed by clinical plus endoscopic and histological criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients also had fistulae (pouch-bladder in 1 and perianal in 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Extraintestinal manifestations were also present in 4 patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum in 2, arthralgiae in 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were refractory to standard therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> was carefully excluded in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients after re-evaluation of the history and examination of the small bowel with enteroclysis or small bowel capsule endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients received Infliximab 5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks and thereafter every 2 months for 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical response was classified as complete, partial, and no response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fistulae closure was classified as complete, partial, and no closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> disease activity index (PDAI) was also used as an outcome measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinically, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After 1 year of follow-up, 5 of the 7 patients had a complete clinical response, and 2 of the 3 patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> had complete fistulae closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At the end of the follow-up period the median PDAI dropped from 11 (baseline) (range, 10-14) to 5 (range, 3-8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Extraintestinal manifestations were in complete remission at the end of the followup period as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that infliximab may be recommended for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> complicated or not by fistulae following IPAA for UC </plain></SENT>
