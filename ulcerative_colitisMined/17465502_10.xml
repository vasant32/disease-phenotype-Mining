<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 130 unrelated subjects with CD and 150 with UC, and 170 matched controls were genotyped for the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The genotypes were determined by using PCR/RFLP test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The G allele frequency and the prevalence of the GG genotype were 38.1% and 12.3% in the CD group, 40.6% and 18.6% in the UC patients, and 37.4% and 15.9% in the control group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of the current study show that carriage of the +49G SNP in heterozygous or in homozygous form does not confer risk either for CD or for UC in the Hungarian population </plain></SENT>
