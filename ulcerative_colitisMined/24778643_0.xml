<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>New epidemiological data suggest that the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) is increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a result the burden of disease accounts for more strains to the health care system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical variability queries whether disease characteristics are related to clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to delineate the latest results of incidence trends in pediatric IBD and to compare the first experiences with Paris Classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incidence of pediatric IBD has been increasing in Western Europe and in Eastern Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To better characterize IBD, Paris Classification was introduced and validated recently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ileocolonic involvement is the most characteristic disease location in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) based on applying Paris Classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of perianal disease and complicated behaviour in CD was similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is of interest that CD patients with colonic involvement were less likely to have stricturing disease compared with patients with ileal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0868908" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pancolitis</z:e> dominated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, most countries lack prospective, nationwide epidemiological studies to estimate incidence trends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This review emphasizes the importance of nationwide registries that enroll <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pediatric IBD cases serving reliable data for "everyday practice." These first reports have shown that Paris Classification is a useful tool to determine the pediatric IBD phenotype </plain></SENT>
