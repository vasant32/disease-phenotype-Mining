<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Whole gut lavage is currently used as preparation before radiological or endoscopic examination of the large bowel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To validate the gut lavage technique for the assessment of mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, by measuring intestinal IgG and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) in the fluid obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Sixteen children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), 14 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), and 22 age matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Isotonic, non-absorbable <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> based lavage solution was given orally or by nasogastric tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clear fluid was collected, filtered, and treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IgG, IL-1 beta and IL-1-receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (IL-1-ra) were measured by sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients with UC and CD, IgG and IL-1 beta levels were significantly (p &lt; 0.001) higher than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation (p &lt; 0.05) was found with disease activity scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IL-1-ra levels were not significantly different in UC and CD, when compared with controls, but the IL-1-ra:IL-1 beta ratio was significantly (p &lt; 0.01) lower in patients with UC and CD, and negatively (p &lt; 0.001) correlated with IgG levels in lavage fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Gut lavage fluid IgG and IL-1 beta levels and IL-1-ra:IL-1 beta ratio may provide objective discrimination between active and inactive disease in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
