<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with IBD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> refractory to conventional therapy often demonstrate higher risk of serious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Combinations of immunosuppression and biological treatment as well as surgical intervention are often used in this patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence, there is need for additional treatment options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this observational study, focused on re-treatment and long-term results, Granulocyte/Monocyte Adsorption (GMA, Adacolumn) treatment has been investigated to study efficacy, safety and quality of life in IBD-patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 25 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, both groups with chronically active <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> refractory to conventional medication were included in this observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients received 5-10 GMA sessions, and the clinical activity was assessed at baseline, after each completed course, and at week 10 and 20 by disease activity index, endoscopy and quality of life evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relapsed patients were re-treated by GMA in this follow-up study up to 58 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinical response was seen in 85% and complete remission in 65% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten patients in the UC-group (66%) and 16 patients in the CD-group (64%) maintained clinical and endoscopic remission for an average of 14 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients who relapsed after showing initial remission were re-treated with GMA and 13 (93%) went into a second remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Following further relapses, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of seven patients were successfully re-treated for the third time, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of three patients for the fourth time and one for a fifth time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IBD-patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> despite conventional therapy seem to benefit from GMA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Re-treatment of relapsing remission patients seems to be effective </plain></SENT>
