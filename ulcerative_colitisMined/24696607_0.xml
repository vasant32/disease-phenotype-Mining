<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Unambiguous diagnosis of the two main forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> (IBD): <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), represents a challenge in the early stages of the diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis may be established several years after the debut of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence, protein biomarkers for early and accurate diagnostic could help clinicians improve treatment of the individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the biomarkers could aid physicians to predict disease courses and in this way, identify patients in need of intensive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with low risk of disease flares may avoid treatment with medications with the concomitant risk of adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, identification of disease and course specific biomarker profiles can be used to identify biological pathways involved in the disease development and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of disease mechanisms in general can lead to improved future development of preventive and treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the clinical use of a panel of biomarkers represents a diagnostic and prognostic tool of potentially great value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The technological development in recent years within proteomic research (determination and quantification of the complete protein content) has made the discovery of novel biomarkers feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Several IBD-associated protein biomarkers are known, but none have been successfully implemented in daily use to distinguish CD and UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The intestinal tissue remains an obvious place to search for novel biomarkers, which blood, urine or stool later can be screened for </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When considering the protein complexity encountered in intestinal biopsy-samples and the recent development within the field of mass spectrometry driven quantitative proteomics, a more thorough and accurate biomarker discovery endeavor could today be performed than ever before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this review, we report the current status of the proteomics IBD biomarkers and discuss various emerging proteomic strategies for identifying and characterizing novel biomarkers, as well as suggesting future targets for analysis </plain></SENT>
