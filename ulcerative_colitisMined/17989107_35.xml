<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both display enhanced intestinal permeability, initiated by gluten exposure (GSE) or <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> interactions (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies showed the association of both diseases with variants in MYO9B, presumably involved in epithelial permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: It was hypothesised that genetic variants in tight junction genes might affect epithelial barrier function, thus contributing to a shared pathogenesis of GSE and IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This hypothesis was tested with a comprehensive genetic association analysis of 41 genes from the tight junction pathway, represented by 197 tag single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two genes, PARD3 (two SNPs) and MAGI2 (two SNPs), showed weak association with GSE in a Dutch cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Replication in a British GSE cohort yielded significance for one SNP in PARD3 and suggestive associations for two additional SNPs, one each in PARD3 and MAGI2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Joint analysis of the British and Dutch data further substantiated the association for both PARD3 (rs10763976, p = 6.4 x 10(-5); OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.37) and MAGI2 (rs6962966, p = 7.6 x 10(-4); OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Association was also observed in Dutch <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients with MAGI2 (rs6962966, p = 0.0036; OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.47), and suggestive association with PARD3 (rs4379776, p = 0.068) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coeliac disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> may share a common aetiology through tight junction-mediated barrier defects, although the observations need further replication </plain></SENT>
