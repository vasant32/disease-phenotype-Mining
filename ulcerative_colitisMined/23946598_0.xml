<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Allelic association between genetic regions of CLDN1, CLDN2 or CLDN4 and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> were investigated using both a case-control study approach (one case randomly selected from each of 191 Swedish <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> families and 333 controls) and a family-based study (463 non-Swedish European <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> -families) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A nonsynonymous coding single nucleotide polymorphism in MORC4, located on the same linkage block as CLDN2, was investigated for association, as were two novel CLDN2 single nucleotide polymorphism markers, identified by resequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A single nucleotide polymorphism marker (rs12014762) located in the genetic region of CLDN2 was significantly associated to CD (case-control allelic OR = 1.98, 95%CI: 1.17-3.35, P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MORC4 was present on the same linkage block as this CD marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using the case-control approach, a significant association (case control allelic OR = 1.61, 95%CI: 1.08-2.41, P = 0.018) was found between CD and a nonsynonymous coding single nucleotide polymorphism (rs6622126) in MORC4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association between the CLDN2 marker and CD was not replicated in the family-based study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> was not associated to any of the single nucleotide polymorphism markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that a variant of the CLDN2-MORC4 region predisposes to CD in a Swedish population </plain></SENT>
