<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (gp) 96 links the adaptive with the innate immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is a chaperone with a binding domain for <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> generated by proteasomal degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During cellular stress, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> loaded gp96 can be released and presented to T cells by antigen presenting cells (APCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> from in vitro differentiated macrophages (iv mac) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intestinal macrophages (IMACs) were compared by subtractive hybridisation and Affymetrix GeneChip analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differentiation induced expression of gp96 was investigated in the multicellular spheroid (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e>) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo gp96 protein expression was detected by double labelling immunohistochemistry of human colon and in the CD4+ CD62L+ T cell transfer mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five of 76 clones obtained by subtractive hybridisation revealed &gt;99% sequence homology to gp96 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Affymetrix GeneChip analysis confirmed induction of gp96 in IMACs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Gp96 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was detected in IMACs from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and intestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel disease</z:e> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Induction of gp96 protein was observed after seven days in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> model of IMAC differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of gp96 protein in IMACs in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa as well as in mucosa from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012813" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticulitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In mucosa from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) patients, gp96 protein was not detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the CD4+ CD62L+ T cell transfer mouse model, gp96 was verifiable in non-activated IMACs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Gp96 is induced during differentiation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> IMACs but is not detected in IMACs in CD mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>As gp96 has been described as having a role in tolerance induction, this may be relevant for loss of tolerance against <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> bacteria found in CD patients </plain></SENT>
