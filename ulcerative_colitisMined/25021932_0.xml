<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our experience in a district general hospital out-patient setting of tacrolimus in patients with steroid refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> UC whom either failed, or were intolerant to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi> and as an alternate to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In England, Wales and Northern Ireland infliximab may no longer be used to treat patients with sub-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> UC.(3) METHODS: A prospective quality and safely assurance audit was undertaken of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with UC treated with tacrolimus from January 2010 until January 2014 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients not responding to or intolerant of conventional therapy met with the consultant gastroenterologist (AWH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were offered treatment with tacrolimus, provided with written drug information or referral for surgical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> agreed to start treatment with tacrolimus (Prograf) 0.1 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses and were monitored according to local protocol with FBC, UandEs and serum trough levels at weeks 2, 4 and 3 monthly thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The dose of tacrolimus was titrated aiming for serum trough levels between 5-20 ng/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical response was assessed by AWH in clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen patients (8 female; mean age 38 [range 19-86]) were treated with tacrolimus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (65%) had a clinical response (median treatment duration 12 [range 2-192] weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four of these (45%) patients developed intolerance to tacrolimus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> n = 2; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo> n = 1; paraesthesia n = 1) and stopped treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seven patients continued on tacrolimus with clinical response and without side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of the 10 patients whom either failed to respond or were intolerant of tacrolimus, 7 underwent colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 3 patients, 1 declined surgery and 2 patients have responded to treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our experience supports the use of tacrolimus in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> UC refractory to conventional treatments as an alternative to elective surgery as infliximab is no longer recommended in these circumstances.(3) However only 7 of 17 (41%) patients had a clinical response and tolerated tacrolimus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Close monitoring of renal function and serum trough levels is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The long-term efficacy and safety of tacrolimus remains unclear </plain></SENT>
