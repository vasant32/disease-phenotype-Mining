<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To explore the abnormal function of platelets and the role of angelica sinensis injection (ASI) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 39 patients with active UC, 25 patients with remissive UC and 30 healthy people, alpha-granule membrane protein (<z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi>-140) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> B(2) (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26996">TXB</z:chebi>(2)) were detected by means of ELISA, 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26340">PGF</z:chebi>(1a) was detected by radioimmunoassay, platelet count (PC) and 1 min platelet aggregation rate (1 min PAR) were detected by blood automatic tester and platelet aggregation tester respectively, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor related antigen (vWF:Ag) was detected by the means of monoclonal -ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 64 patients with UC were divided into two therapy groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After routine treatment and angelica sinensis injection (ASI) + routine treatment respectively for 3 weeks, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these parameters were also detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The PC, 1 min PAR and levels of <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi>-140, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26996">TXB</z:chebi>(2), and vWF:Ag in active UC were significantly higher than those in remissive UC and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (P&lt;0.05-0.01).Meanwhile, 1 min PAR and levels of <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi>-140, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26996">TXB</z:chebi>(2), and vWF:Ag in remissive UC were still significantly higher than those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26340">PGF</z:chebi>(1a) level in active and remissive UC was remarkably lower than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control (P&lt;0.05-0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These parameters except 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26340">PGF</z:chebi>(1a) were significantly improved after the treatment in ASI therapy group (P&lt;0.05-0.01), whereas they <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were little changed in routine therapy group (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Platelets can be significantly activated in UC, which might be related with vascular endothelium injury and imbalance between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26996">TXB</z:chebi>(2) and 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26340">PGF</z:chebi>(1a) in blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ASI can significantly inhibit platelet activation, relieve vascular endothelial cell injury, and improve microcirculation in UC </plain></SENT>
