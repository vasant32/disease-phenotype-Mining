<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although high non-adherence to medication has been noticed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), little is known about adherence to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalamine</z:chebi> treatments and determinants that can predict adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to assess adherence and persistence to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalamine</z:chebi> treatments and their potential determinants in mild to moderate UC patients in a real-life setting in Quebec, Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective prescription and medical claims analysis was conducted using a random sample of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalamine</z:chebi> users with UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For inclusion, patients were required to initiate an oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalamine</z:chebi> treatment between January 2005 and December 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment adherence (medication possession ratio [MPR]) and persistence were evaluated over a 1-year period after the index prescription using the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test and stepwise regression to identify potential determinants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A sample of 1,681 of the new oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalamine</z:chebi> users (mean age = 55.3) patients was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, the percentage of patients with a MPR of 80% or greater at 12 months was 27.7%, while persistence was 45.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalamine</z:chebi> delayed/extended-release tablets (MezavantÂ®), adherence and persistence were 40.9% and 71.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Predictors of high adherence included, male gender (OR=1.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.1-1.6), older age (&gt;60 years; OR=1.6; 95% CI=1.3-2.0) and current use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> (OR=1.4; 95% CI=1.1-1.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Predictors of high persistence included male sex (OR=1.4; 95% CI=1.1-1.7), current use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> (OR=1.4; 95% CI=1.1-1.7) and presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035204" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">respiratory diseases</z:e> (OR=1.2; 95% CI=1.01-1.55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with UC exhibited low adherence and persistence to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalamine</z:chebi> treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Various determinants of improved adherence and persistence were identified </plain></SENT>
