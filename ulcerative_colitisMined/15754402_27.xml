<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> (IBD) are multifactorial pathologies of unknown etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One susceptibility locus, IBD5, has been mapped to chromosome 5q31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed our Spanish cohorts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) patients to determine whether this locus is associated with IBD, and to ascertain the main clinical phenotype influenced by this risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The kind of interaction, either <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> or epistasis, between this IBD5 susceptibility region and the NOD2/CARD15 gene mutations was studied as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, we assessed whether this locus can predict response to infliximab therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case control study was performed with 274 CD and 211 UC patients recruited from a single center and 511 healthy ethnically matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two polymorphisms were genotyped in the IBD5 locus and three in the CARD15/NOD2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our results evidence association only with CD especially with the fistulizing phenotype and in the absence of NOD2/CARD15 variants (mutant allele frequency in patients vs controls: OR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.35-3.06, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the IBD5 homozygous mutant genotype significantly increased in CD patients lacking response to infliximab (RR = 3.88, 95% CI = 1.18-12.0, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>UC patients overall do not show association with 5q31 polymorphisms, although a similar trend to the one observed in CD is found within the worse prognosis group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The IBD5 variants may enhance an individual carrier's risk for CD, mainly in the absence of the NOD2/CARD15 mutations and in fistulizing patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The data presented suggest the potential role of the 5q31 polymorphisms as markers of response to infliximab </plain></SENT>
