<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Il-18 concentrations were measured in plasma and mucosal samples from 15 patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean plasma concentration of IL-18 measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (422+/-88 pg/mL) doubled the mean value in healthy controls (206+/-32 pg/mL); however, the difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma IL-18 levels revealed a significant positive correlation with scored endoscopic degree of mucosal injury, disease activity index, clinical activity index and C-reactive protein concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean concentration of plasma IL-18 was significantly higher in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (535+/-115 pg/mL) than in patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (195+/-41 pg/mL), and in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the mucosal mean IL-18 concentration in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (2 523+/-618 pg/mg protein) doubled values observed in mild one (1 347+/-308 pg/mg protein), there was no statistically significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Plasma IL-18 can be considered as a surrogate marker helpful in evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> activity </plain></SENT>
