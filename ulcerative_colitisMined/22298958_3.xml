<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The natural course of disease can range from an indolent course with prolonged periods of remission to aggressive, incapacitating disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Predicting which patients are more susceptible to developing severe disease is important, especially when choosing therapeutic agents and treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This paper reviews current evidence on the main demographic, clinical, endoscopic, histologic, serologic, and genetic markers that predict aggressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, we considered disease to be aggressive when patients had a high relapse rate, need for admission and/or surgery, development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, or extraintestinal manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We defined aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> as having a high relapse rate, development of penetrating disease, need for repeat surgery, or multiple admissions for flares </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, involvement of the upper gastrointestinal tract and ileum, penetrating disease, early age at diagnosis, smoking, extensive ulceration of the mucosa, high titers of serum antibodies, and mutations of the NOD2 gene are markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, patients with more extensive involvement of the colon (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0868908" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pancolitis</z:e>) have more symptomatology and are at higher risk for needing a colectomy and developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, plasmocytic infiltration of the colonic mucosa and crypt <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> predict treatment failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As with diagnosis, no single method can predict disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multiple serologic and genetic tests are being developed to refine the accuracy of prediction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic findings can also predict the future course of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At present, clinical manifestations are the most useful way to make therapeutic decisions </plain></SENT>
