<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To explore the association of MYO9B gene polymorphisms with clinical phenotypes and intestinal permeability of individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 442 IBD patients and 402 healthy volunteers were genotyped for two single <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> (rs962917 and rs1545620) using the ligase detection reaction and polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Allelic and genotype frequency analyses were performed for the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intestinal permeability was evaluated using lactulose (L) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> (M) excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association of MYO9B gene polymorphisms with intestinal permeability between the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and high intestinal permeability groups was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, there was no significant difference in the genotypic and allelic frequencies of MYO9B between IBD patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although no association was found with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in the comparison between the subgroups, the frequencies of rs962917 and rs1545620 were different in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) subgroup with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0949272" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ileocolitis</z:e> (CC vs CT and TT, P = 0.014; and AA vs AC and CC, P = 0.022, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>rs1545620 variants appear to be the genetic susceptibility factor for perianal disease in CD patients (AA vs AC CC, P = 0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the L/M ratio was significantly higher in IBD patients than in controls (0.065 ± 0.013 vs 0.020 ± 0.002, P = 0.02), but no association was found between the MYO9B gene and the L/M ratio in IBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MYO9B gene polymorphisms may influence the sub-phenotypic expression of CD in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No association between these MYO9B polymorphisms and intestinal permeability in IBD patients was found </plain></SENT>
