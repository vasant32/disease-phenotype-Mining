<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ileocolonic variant of CD, an <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of both the ileum and the large intestine, accounts for up to 50% of the cases with CD, whereas Crohn's <z:mp ids='MP_0009482'>ileitis</z:mp> affecting the ileum is diagnosed in about 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, which is confined to the large intestine and accounts for the remaining 20%, is difficult to distinguish from the large bowel <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> seen in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of CD is not yet completely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>Autoimmunity</z:hpo> is one factor that can partake in the triggering or modulation of inflammatory processes in IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The major zymogen-granule membrane <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 2 (GP2) has been recently identified as a major autoantigenic target in CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, GP2 is mainly expressed in the pancreas and has also been demonstrated to be a membrane-anchored receptor of microfold cells in the follicle-associated epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, GP2 is overexpressed at the site of CD <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in contrast to the one in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By utilizing novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for the detection of GP2-specific IgA and IgG, the loss of tolerance to GP2 has been associated with a specific clinical phenotype in CD, in particular with the ileocolonic location of the disease </plain></SENT>
