<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although many recent studies have shown the increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> in relatives of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, clinical patterns of disease within families remain relatively poorly documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: In this study, clinical characteristics (disease type, extent, age on <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, need for surgery, and presence of extraintestinal manifestations) have been compared in affected subjects in multiply-affected families, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 54 families in whom one parent and at least one child were affected (a total of 77 parent-child pairs) and 155 families in whom at least two siblings were affected (a total of 190 affected sibling pairs) were involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In affected parent-child pairs, parent and child were concordant for disease type in 58 of 77 pairs (75.3%), for extent in 63.6%, extraintestinal manifestations in 70.1%, and smoking history in 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> in parents was significantly higher than offspring (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 40 pairs, 60.6%, the parent was at least 10 years older than child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Siblings were concordant for disease type in 81.6% of the affected sibling pairs, extent in 76.0%, extraintestinal manifestations in 83.8%, and smoking history in 81.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast with the parent-child pairs, 68.1% (111 sibling pairs) siblings were diagnosed within 10 years of each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> was 24.0 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown consistent clinical patterns in many families with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> between parents and children are not readily explained by a simple cohort effect or ascertainment bias, and may reflect effects of genetic factors, producing anticipation between generations </plain></SENT>
