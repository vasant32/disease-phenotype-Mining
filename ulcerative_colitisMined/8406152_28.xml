<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chemiluminescence is a reliable means of estimating reactive oxygen species in biological media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increased reactive oxygen species values in the inflamed colonic mucosa in rats were seen by chemiluminescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aims of the study were to find out if chemiluminescence is raised in the colonic mucosa of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and correlates with disease activity, and to elucidate the sources of the chemiluminescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was found that reactive oxygen species, as measured by the chemiluminescence technique, are raised in inflamed colonic mucosa and correlates with symptom score, sigmoidoscopic score, disease activity, and activity of the neutrophil enzyme myeloperoxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chemiluminescence was inhibited by a myeloperoxidase inhibitor (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="40910">azide</z:chebi>) and an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> scavenger (catalase) but not by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi>, an inhibitor of the enzyme <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15318,17712">xanthine</z:chebi> oxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chemiluminescence was also inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi>, but this did not seem to be related to inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that a likely cellular source of reactive oxygen species in the inflamed colon of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> is the neutrophil and that myeloperoxidase conversion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24757">hypochlorous acid</z:chebi>, contributes to the chemiluminescence signal and possibly, to the tissue injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither cyclo-oxygenase nor lipoxygenase seem to play a part as sources for the chemiluminescence </plain></SENT>
