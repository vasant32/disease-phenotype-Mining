<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Firm recommendations about the way <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> drugs are introduced and the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> methyltransferase (TPMT) and metabolite measurements during treatment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate pharmacokinetics and tolerance after initiation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> treatment with a fixed dosing schedule in patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 60 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (n = 33) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (n = 27) were included in a 20 week open, prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">Thiopurine</z:chebi> treatment was introduced using a predefined dose escalation schedule, reaching a daily target dose at week 3 of 2.5 mg <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> or 1.25 mg <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50667">6-mercaptopurine</z:chebi> per kg body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TPMT and ITPA genotypes, TPMT activity, TPMT gene expression, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> metabolites were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome and occurrence of adverse events were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 27 patients completed the study per protocol, while 33 were withdrawn (early protocol violation (n = 5), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0342801" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">TPMT deficiency</z:e> (n = 1), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> related adverse events (n = 27)); 67% of patients with adverse events tolerated long term treatment on a lower dose (median 1.32 mg <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>/kg body weight) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TPMT activity did not change during the 20 week course of the study but a significant decrease in TPMT gene expression was found (TPMT/huCYC ratio; p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with meTIMP concentrations &gt;11,450 pmol/8 x 10(8) red blood cells during steady state at week 5 had an increased risk of developing myelotoxicity (odds ratio = 45.0; p = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After initiation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> treatment using a fixed dosing schedule, no general induction of TPMT enzyme activity occurred, though TPMT gene expression decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The development of different types of toxicity was unpredictable, but we found that measurement of meTIMP early in the steady state phase helped to identify patients at risk of developing myelotoxicity </plain></SENT>
