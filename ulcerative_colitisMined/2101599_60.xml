<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In both diseases, the CD25+ cells are present as aggregates in the lamina propria below the epithelium, and constitute a large proportion of the lamina propria mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, CD25+ cells are abundant in the submucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CD25+ cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> are 58-88% CD3+, CD4+, CD8-, indicating that they are T cells, whereas in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> the CD25+ cells are greater than 80% CD3-, CD4+, HLA-DR+, indicating that they are macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, differential expression of CD25 on T cells and macrophages serves to distinguish the immunologic lesions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
