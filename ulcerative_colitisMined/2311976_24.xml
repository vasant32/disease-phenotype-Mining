<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chemiluminescent responses of neutrophils from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, however, were similar to control responses when cells were stimulated with latex beads or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Monocytes from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> produced significantly greater levels of chemiluminescence than control monocytes when stimulated with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi> (p less than 0.002), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (p less than 0.0005) or latex beads (p less than 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monocytes from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> also produced significantly greater levels of chemiluminescence than controls when stimulated with latex beads (p less than 0.5) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (p less than 0.0005), although there was no difference in the level of chemiluminescence in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results exclude a generalised defect in phagocytic cell oxidase activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> and suggest that circulating monocytes are 'activated' </plain></SENT>
