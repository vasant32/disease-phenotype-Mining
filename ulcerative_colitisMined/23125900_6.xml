<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) for the detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in long-standing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively performed a surveillance colonoscopy in 51 patients affected by long-standing UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Also, in the presence of macroscopic areas with suspected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, both targeted contrasted indigo carmine endoscopic assessment and probe-based CLE were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Colic mucosal biopsies and histology, utilised as the gold standard, were assessed randomly and on visible lesions, in accordance with current guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen of the 51 patients (27%) showed macroscopic mucosal alterations with the suspected presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, needing chromoendoscopic and CLE evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 5 macroscopically suspected cases, the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was confirmed by histology (3 flat <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>; 2 DALMs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was found on any of the outstanding random biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic accuracy of CLE for the detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> compared to standard histology was sensitivity 100%, specificity 90%, positive predictive value 83% and negative predictive value 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CLE is an accurate tool for the detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in long-standing UC and shows optimal values of sensitivity and negative predictivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The scheduled combined application of chromoendoscopy and CLE could maximize the endoscopic diagnostic accuracy for diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in UC patients, thus limiting the need for biopsies </plain></SENT>
