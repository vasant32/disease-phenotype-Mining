<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD is characterized as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> of the gastrointestinal tract, ranging from the mouth to the anus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although there are gross pathological and histological similarities between CD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Johne's disease</z:e> of cattle, the cause of CD remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is vital to understand fully the cause of this disease because it affects approximately 500,000 people in North America and Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It ranges from 27 to 48 cases per 100,000 people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There are many theories on the cause of CD ranging from possible association with environmental factors including microorganisms to imbalance in the intestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> flora of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regardless of the environmental trigger, there is strong evidence that a genetic disposition is a major key in acquiring CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Many studies have proven the link between mutations in the ATG16L, NOD2/CARD15, IBD5, CTLA4, TNFSF15 and IL23R genes, and CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this review is to examine <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> genetic aspects and theories of CD, including up to date multiple population studies performed worldwide </plain></SENT>
