<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM:To observe the therapeutic effect of moxibustion on <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and its influence on the colonic mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>.METHODS:Forty-six patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> were randomly divided into the moxibustion with herbal medicine underneath group and the western medicine group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients were treated with the above moxibustion and 16 patients with Salicylaye fapyridine (SASP).The colonic mucosa of 13 patients in the moxibustion group was observed by colonoscopy before and after the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mucin was also analyzed by H.E and AB-<z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> staining.RESULTS:Seventeen patients were clinically cured,12 were improved and 1 unchanged in the moxibustion group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the control group, 5 patients were clinically cured,7 improved and 4 unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients with active UC were taken as the subjects for histopathologic analysis in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The colonic mucosal lesions were remarkably improved and the characteristic of the mucin also changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In most sections, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of mucosa was geatly ameliorated (P&lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The inflammatory cell infiltratation much decreased and neutrophils, disapeared in most sections (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The goblet cells significantly increased (P&lt;0.001); crypt paracrypt <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> or mucosal ulceration was seen(P&lt;0.001).CONCLUSION:The rate of cure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> by moxibustion with herbal medicine beneath is superior to that by SASP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This sort of moxibustion can effectively improve the colonic mucosal lesions and restore the proportion of mucoprotein to near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
