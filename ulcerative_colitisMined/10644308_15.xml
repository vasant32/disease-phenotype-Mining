<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025007" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Measles</z:e> virus is implicated in the aetiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025007" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">measles</z:e> hypothesis is mainly supported by immunohistochemical findings that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025007" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">measles</z:e> related antigen is present in the intestine of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently we isolated this antigen from the intestine of a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> using a molecular cloning technique and produced the monoclonal antibody against it (designated 4F12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: To discover whether the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025007" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">measles</z:e> related antigen is uniquely present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS/METHODS: Colonic mucosa samples from 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 20 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, 11 with non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, and nine controls were immunohistochemically stained with the anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025007" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">measles</z:e> monoclonal antibody 4F12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The numbers of positive cells, the ratio of positive cells to nucleated cells, and the staining intensity of the positive cells were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the distribution of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025007" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">measles</z:e> antigen in other human organs was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both the number of positive cells and the ratio of positive cells to nucleated cells were significantly increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and non-IBD <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> compared with controls (p&lt;0.05) but were similar among the three disease groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The staining intensity of the positive cells was also similar among the three disease groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Small numbers of positive cells were observed in the oesophagus, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, and lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025007" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">measles</z:e> related antigen in the colonic mucosa was not unique to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results, together with the observation that such a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025007" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">measles</z:e> related antigen was derived from host protein, do not support the hypothesis that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025007" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">measles</z:e> virus causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
