<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The standardised incidence of UC in Europeans and South Asians was stable, except in Sikhs in whom it had increased rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relative risk of UC to South Asians was 2.45 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The standardised incidences of UC in South Asians during the 1980s were: 10.8/10(5)/year in Hindus (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.4-14.1 cases/10(5)/year) 16.5/10(5)/year in Sikhs (95% CI 7.9-25.2 cases/10(5)/year), and 6.2/10(5)/year in Muslims (95% CI 1.6-10.9 cases/10(5)/year) </plain></SENT>
