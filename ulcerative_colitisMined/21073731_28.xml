<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest a link between gut microbiota and the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022104" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IBS">irritable bowel syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate any quantitative differences in faecal <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> compositions in UC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> patients compared to healthy controls, and to identify individual <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> species that contribute to these differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Faecal microbiota of 13 UC patients, 11 IBS patients and 22 healthy volunteers were analysed by PCR-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) using universal and Bacteroides specific primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data obtained were normalized using in-house developed statistical method and interrogated by multivariate approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The differentiated bands were excised and identified by sequencing the V3 region of the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26833">16S</z:chebi> rRNA genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Band profiles revealed that number of predominant faecal bacteria were significantly different between UC, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> and control group (p &lt; 10-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By assessing the mean band numbers in UC (37 ± 5) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> (39 ± 6), compared to the controls (45 ± 3), a significant decrease in <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> species is suggested (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> and UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Biodiversity of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> species was significantly lower in UC (μ = 2.94, σ = 0.29) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> patients (μ = 2.90, σ = 0.38) than controls (μ = 3.25, σ = 0.16; p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, similarity indices revealed greater biological variability of predominant bacteria in UC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> compared to the controls (median Dice coefficients 76.1% (IQR 70.9 - 83.1), 73.8% (IQR 67.0 - 77.5) and 82.9% (IQR 79.1 - 86.7) respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DNA sequencing of discriminating bands suggest that the presence of Bacteroides vulgatus, B. ovatus, B. uniformis, and Parabacteroides sp. in healthy volunteers distinguishes them from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> and UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DGGE profiles of Bacteroides species revealed a decrease of Bacteroides community in UC relative to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Molecular profiling of faecal bacteria revealed abnormalities of intestinal microbiota in UC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> patients, while different patterns of Bacteroides species loss in particular, were associated with UC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
