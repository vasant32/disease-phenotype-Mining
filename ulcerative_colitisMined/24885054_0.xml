<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Paneth cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (PCM) is well described in adults but little is known about the distribution of colonic Paneth cells and the occurrence of PCM in a paediatric population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to determine whether Paneth cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> characteristically occurs in the colons of children with newly diagnosed idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed colonic series from 28 new diagnoses of paediatric IBD at a tertiary referral centre, and from a further 14 children with IBD-like symptoms whose colonic biopsies and ancillary investigations were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Paneth cells were counted at 6 anatomical sites in the colon, and at each site <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> were assessed semi-quantitatively and the presence or absence of crypt architectural distortion and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> was documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In control, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) groups there was a gradient of decreasing Paneth cell numbers from caecum to rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Paneth cells were not seen in the distal colon in the control group, but they were present there in 11 of 13 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 14 of 15 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only patients with IBD showed Paneth cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, assessed as more than 10 Paneth cells per 10 well-oriented crypts at any site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant increase in Paneth cells in the caecum, ascending, transverse and descending colon in UC and in the ascending, transverse, descending and sigmoid colon in CD compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between UC and CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the site of PCM and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, crypt distortion or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Paneth cells are found in the proximal but not the distal colon in otherwise <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> paediatric colonic series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A high proportion of UC and CD patients show PCM in the distal colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This is present early in the disease and does not correlate with histological features of chronicity </plain></SENT>
