<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fecal Lf and Hb were measured using ELISA in 872 patients before they underwent colorectal endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lf was positive in 18 (50%) of 36 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, 25 (15.9%) of 157 with colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, 29 (46.8%) of 62 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and 25 (62.5%) of 40 (62.5%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Hb-positive rates were 50%, 12.1%, 41.9% and 32.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 318 patients free of abnormalities by colorectal endoscopy, Lf was positive in 29 (9.1%) and Hb was positive in 15 (4.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, the Lf-positive rate was significantly higher than the Hb-positive rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If either high Lf or Hb levels were considered positive, the positive rates rose to 61.1%, 51.6%, and 67.5% in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> group, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If both high Lf and Hb levels were rated positive, the positive predictive values (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) were 21% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, 33% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and 17% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> of high Hb level alone was 18%, 25% and 13%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Fecal Lf and Hb were found useful in the detection of colorectal diseases, and the combination of the two measurements appears to increase the sensitivity and efficacy of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
