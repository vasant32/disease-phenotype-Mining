<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The number and identity of susceptibility genes is largely uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytokine genes are attractive candidate loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To study allelic frequencies of polymorphisms of the interleukin-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (IL-1RA) gene and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha gene in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: One hundred and twenty nine North European caucasoid patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, 120 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, and 89 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) in the IL-1RA gene and a single base pair polymorphism in the TNF alpha gene promoter region (TNF-308) were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant differences in IL-1RA VNTR allelic frequencies were noted between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (allele 1: 72.6%, allele 2: 24.7%, allele 3: 2.6%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (72.6%, 24.3%, 3.1%, respectively), and controls (76.9%, 20.8% and 2.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Some 42.4% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 43.4% patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> were carriers of allele 2, compared with 34.8% healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The TNF2 allele was modestly reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (13.2%), compared with healthy subjects (21.3%; p = 0.04), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (21.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The associations demonstrated are modest: these polymorphisms are unlikely to be important determinants of overall disease susceptibility </plain></SENT>
