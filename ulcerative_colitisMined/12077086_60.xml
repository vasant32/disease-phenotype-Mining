<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It predisposes to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) yet is associated with a reduced incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have studied sib pairs discordant for both smoking and IBD phenotype (UC or CD) to investigate whether smoking determines the type of IBD that develops in individuals with very similar genetic susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Smoking habits and disease characteristics were analysed in 242 IBD pedigrees (658 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within this group there were 339 affected sibling pairs of whom 89 were discordant for smoking when diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Smoking at diagnosis was associated with development of CD (odds ratio (OR) 3.55; 95% confidence limits 2.50-5.02; p&lt;0.001) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the familial patients, with increases when analysed for ileocaecal disease, fibrostenosis, and intestinal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Smokers were also protected from UC (OR 0.28; 0.2-0.4; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 89 sibling pairs discordant for smoking at diagnosis, 23 were also discordant for disease type-in 21 of these, CD occurred in the smoker and UC in the non-smoker (OR 10.5; 2.6-92; p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Smoking is a strong environmental risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and increases the likelihood of needing surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, sib pairs who are discordant for both smoking and IBD type almost always show CD in the smoker and UC in the non-smoker, and so in some cases tobacco consumption acts on IBD genetic predisposition to shift the phenotype from UC towards CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The explanation of part of the apparent "protective" effect of smoking on <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> UC may be that the form of IBD that develops in a proportion of smokers is not UC but CD </plain></SENT>
