<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Healthy adult Sprague-Dawley rats of both sexes, weighing 180+/-30 g, were employed in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rat model of UC was induced by 2,4,6-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48110">trinitrobenzene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29214">sulfonic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi>) enema </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The experimental animals were randomly divided into garlicin treatment group (including high and low concentration), model control group, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats in garlicin treatment group and model control group received intracolic garlicin daily at doses of 10.0 and 30.0 mg/kg and equal amount of saline respectively 24 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> model was induced by alcohol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi> co-enema </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group received neither alcohol nor only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi> but only saline enema in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the 28th d of the experiment, rats were executed, the expression of bcl-2 and bax protein was determined immunohistochemically and the apoptotic cells were detected by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> fluorescence nick end labeling (TUNEL) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the same time, the rat colon mucosal damage index (CMDI) was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In garlicin treatment group, the positive expression of bcl-2 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024312" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lymphocytes decreased</z:e> and the number of apoptotic cells was more than that in model control group, CMDI was lower than that in model control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The positive expression of bax in lymphocytes had no significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Garlicin can protect colonic mucosa against damage in rat model of UC induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi> enema </plain></SENT>
