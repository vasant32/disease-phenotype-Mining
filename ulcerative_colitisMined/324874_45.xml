<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Intestinal disaccharidase and dipeptidase activities were measured in mucosal biopsies from the proximal jejunum in 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> apparently confined to the distal ileum or large bowel, 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and 14 healthy volunteers who acted as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The dissecting microscopy and histological appearance of the biopsies were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (Gd 0-1) except for two which showed grade 2 changes. tbiopsy morphometry showed a reduction of jejunal mucosal surface area and an increase in mucosal volume in patients with Chron's disease when compared with the other two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mucosal enzymes studies demonstrated that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> had a significant reduction in brush-border enzymes (disaccharidase) but no change in cytoplasmic enzyme activity (dipeptidases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The enzyme levels in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> did not differ from the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reduction of brush-border enzymes with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytoplasmic enzymes in the presence of abnormal morphometry is further evidence of the concept of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> as a diffuse lesion of the gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It also suggests that there is either specific damage to the microvilli or some other abnormality such as impairment of enzyme synthesis </plain></SENT>
