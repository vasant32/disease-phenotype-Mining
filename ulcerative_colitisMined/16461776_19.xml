<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Previous chromatographic analysis of colonic mucins from monozygotic twins with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) suggested a genetic mucin alteration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study explores this further by assessing mucosal expression of the oncofetal carbohydrate antigen TF (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi> beta1, 3 N-acetylgalactosamine alpha-), among the same IBD twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Formalin fixed paraffin embedded rectal biopsies were studied from 22 monozygotic twin pairs with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These included eight UC twin pairs and 14 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) twin pairs, with six pairs concordant for disease and 16 unaffected twin siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Closely adjacent sections were assessed by peanut lectin histochemistry for TF expression and immunohistochemically for nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) activation with investigators blinded to the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Unaffected twins were almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> TF positive (15/16) compared with 5/29 histologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unaffected UC (7/8) and CD twins (8/8) were similarly TF positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TF positivity was confined mainly to the superficial epithelium and absent from the stem cell compartment of the lower crypts, suggesting that glycosylation changes are acquired rather than genetically determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Activated NFkappaB was present in the surface epithelium of mucosal biopsies from 13/14 unaffected IBD twins but in only 6/22 histologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (p=0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 22 affected IBD twins were TF positive and 18 were positive for activated NFkappaB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Altered mucosal glycosylation in unaffected identical twins of IBD patients was confirmed in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This occurred in both UC and CD twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The changes are probably acquired rather than congenital and may reflect "preinflammatory" NFkappaB activation </plain></SENT>
