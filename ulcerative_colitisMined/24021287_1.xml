<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Bacteria play an important role in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and perpetuation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unlike in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), in which dysbiosis has been better characterised, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), only small cohorts have been studied and showed conflicting data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we evaluated in a large cohort if the microbial signature described in CD is also present in UC, and if we could characterise predominant dysbiosis in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To assess the functional impact of dysbiosis, we quantified the <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> metabolites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The predominant microbiota from 127 UC patients and 87 age and sex-matched controls was analysed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences were quantitatively validated using real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Metabolites were quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Based on DGGE analysis, the microbial signature previously described in CD was not present in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Real-time PCR analysis revealed a lower abundance of Roseburia hominis (p&lt;0.0001) and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (p&lt;0.0001) in UC patients compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both species showed an inverse correlation with disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="26666">Short-chain fatty acids</z:chebi> (SCFA) were reduced in UC patients (p=0.014), but no direct correlation between SCFA and the identified bacteria was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The composition of the fecal microbiota of UC patients differs from that of healthy individuals: we found a reduction in R hominis and F prausnitzii, both well-known <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>-producing bacteria of the Firmicutes phylum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results underscore the importance of dysbiosis in IBD but suggest that different <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> species contribute to the pathogenesis of UC and CD </plain></SENT>
