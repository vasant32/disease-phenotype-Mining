<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its' aim is to enable multidisciplinary management of patients with a consultant gastroenterologist, consultant obstetrician, colorectal surgeon and IBD specialist nurse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It provides a baseline health check in the early stages of pregnancy, more intensive foetal growth monitoring with additional growth scans at 28 and 32 weeks of pregnancy, discussion of delivery methods and anticipation of potential peripartum problems including liaison with colorectal surgical team </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A review of the service was performed after 8 months to provide an overview of management of patients, demand and outcomes following set up of the service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of medical notes was performed of patients seen in the clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Information was gathered on diagnosis, previous surgery for IBD, parity, outcomes of previous pregnancies, medication preconception and during pregnancy, disease activity preconception and during pregnancy and outcome of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data was collected on 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>8 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010346" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Crohns disease</z:e> (CD), 12 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surgery: In the UC group 3/12 had previous surgery:2 ileoanal pouch, 1 subtotal colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In CD group 4/8 had an ileocolonic resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Parity: 5=para 1, 8=para 2, 6=para 3, 1=para 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Medication: 11/20 were on no medication (6 UC, 5 CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>3 were on infliximab, last infusion 20/40, 3 were on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>, 5 were on a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Disease activity: 19/20 were well preconception, 1 was unwell around time of conception (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> at 11/40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>10/20 had a flare of disease activity during pregnancy: 1 settled with topical treatment, 1 settled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5ASA</z:chebi>, 8 required oral steroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 patients on infliximab had a flare after stopping it and required oral steroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>1 of these had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillbirth</z:hpo> shortly after commencing steroids for a flare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Outcomes: 10/20 have not yet delivered, 3 are planned for elective CS (1 perianal disease, 1 previous CS, 1 previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011411'>forceps delivery</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>3 had CS (2 had ileoanal pouches and 1 had perianal disease), 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillbirth</z:hpo>, 1 miscarriage, 5 had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vaginal delivery (NVD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>No preterm births or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weights</z:hpo> reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Those with ileoanal pouches and perianal disease are being appropriately considered for a planned CS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>50% of our patients have a NVD which as expected is lower than the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>50% of our patients had a flare in disease during pregnancy which is higher than literature (30%)(1.) 80% required oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> to settle and both adverse outcomes appear to be related to a flare in disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Those on infliximab appear to be at high risk of flaring after their last dose around 20 weeks </plain></SENT>
