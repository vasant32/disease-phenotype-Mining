<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The OCTN1 (SLC22A4 1672C--&gt;T) and OCTN2 (SLC22A5 -207G--&gt;C) variants within the IBD5 locus have been associated with susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), but their contribution in children has not been examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: These OCTN1/2 variants and IBD5 marker single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (IGR2096a_1, IGR2198a_1, and IGR2230a_1) were examined in 299 Scottish children (200 with CD, 74 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), and 25 with indeterminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (IC)), together with 502 parents (for transmission disequilibrium testing) and 256 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> SNPs were in strong linkage disequilibrium (D' &gt;0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TDT analysis showed association of the OCTN1 variant with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) (p = 0.01) and CD (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Allele frequencies of the OCTN1/2 variants were significantly higher in IBD/CD cases (p&lt;0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The homozygous mutant OCTN1/2 haplotype was increased in IBD (24.3% v 16.1%, p = 0.02) and UC (28.2% v 16.1%, p = 0.02) compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The OCTN1/2 variants were not independent of the background IBD5 risk haplotype in conferring disease susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unifactorial analysis in CD patients showed that carriage of the TC haplotype was associated with lower weight, height, and BMI centile (&lt;9(th) centile) at diagnosis (weight: 87.9% v 67.3% (p = 0.002), odds ratio (OR) = 3.52 (95% confidence interval, 1.51 to 8.22); height: 84.1% v 68.4% (p&lt;0.05), OR = 2.44 (1.00 to 5.99); BMI: 79.6% v 61.1% (p = 0.02), OR = 2.49 (1.14 to 5.44)), and lower weight centile at follow up (87.5% v 64.6% (p = 0.03), OR = 3.83 (1.03 to 14.24)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multifactorial binary logistic regression analysis confirmed association of the TC haplotype with lower weight centile at diagnosis (p = 0.02, OR = 3.41 (1.20 to 9.66)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data implicate variants within the IBD5 haplotype, as determinants of disease susceptibility and growth indices in early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The OCTN1/2 variants remain potential positional candidate genes, but require further analysis </plain></SENT>
