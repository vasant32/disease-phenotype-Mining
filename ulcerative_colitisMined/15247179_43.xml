<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There are conflicting reports on the role of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> (AZA) thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) metabolites in optimising therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate TGN intrapatient variation, and the relationship between TGN concentrations and disease activity in IBD patients taking long term constant dose AZA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: TGN and methylmercaptopurine nucleotide (MeMPN) concentrations were measured at intervals over a two year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was assessed at each clinic visit using the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> activity index or Walmsley simple index for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serial TGNs were measured in 159 patients (3-14 TGN assays, median 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intrapatient variation in TGN concentrations was 1-5-fold (median 1.6); the incidence of non-compliance was 13% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the end of two years, 131 patients were evaluable at TGN steady state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of this group, patients who remained in remission had significantly higher mean TGN concentrations than those patients who developed active disease (median TGNs 236 v 175, respectively; median difference 44 pmol (95% confidence interval 1-92); p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MeMPN concentrations were not related to AZA efficacy or toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that lower TGN concentrations were linked to the development of active disease, and that TGNs may act as useful markers of compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, it is clear that repeat TGN measurements are required for an unambiguous index of active metabolite exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In view of the high intrapatient variability in TGN production over time, TGN measurements may not be currently advocated for routine clinical use </plain></SENT>
