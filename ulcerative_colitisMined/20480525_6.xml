<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Conventional and NBI colonoscopy was performed in 14 patients with colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biopsy samples were taken and CD31 expression was assayed immunohistochemically; microvascular density was assessed by vessel count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In areas that were endoscopically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> but positive on NBI, there was a significant (P &lt; 0.05) increase in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> (12 +/- 1 vessels/field vs 18 +/- 2 vessels/field) compared with areas negative on NBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, in areas that were inflamed on white light endoscopy and positive on NBI, there was a significant (P &lt; 0.01) increase in vessel density (24 +/- 7 vessels/field) compared with NBI-negative areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NBI may allow in vivo imaging of intestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in IBD patients </plain></SENT>
