<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Skin window tests were performed on 60 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 20 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, 16 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030920" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PUD|pud|GDU">peptic ulceration</z:e>, and 40 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The numbers of neutrophils that migrated into the skin window chambers were significantly lower in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This abnormality was unrelated to the activity of the disease, site of involvement, or treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No significant abnormalities were found in the patients with other diseases of the gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001911'>abnormality of neutrophil</z:hpo> migration in the Crohn's patients does not seem to be due to a cellular defect, as neutrophils from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> migrate and phagocytose normally in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sera from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> did not inhibit cell migration or contain inhibitors of chemotaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The addition of serum that had been activated with zymosan to the chamber enhanced the emigration of neutrophils from the skin of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of neutrophil migration into skin windows that is normally observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> is due to a deficient local <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This defective <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and the consequent delay in the accumulation of neutrophils could explain granuloma formation, the high recurrence rate after surgery, and the clinical course of exacerbations and remissions </plain></SENT>
