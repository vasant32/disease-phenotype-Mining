<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To investigate the role of E-selectin in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: E-selectin expression was assessed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> by measuring the concentration of circulating soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin) using ELISA, by immunohistochemistry of colonic biopsy specimens, and by abdominal immunoscintigraphy after injecting radiolabelled F(ab')2 fragment of a monoclonal anti-E-selectin antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The value of scintigraphy using anti-E-selectin was judged by a prospective comparative study of autologous leucocyte scanning and E-selectin antibody scanning in 17 patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Circulating sE-selectin was elevated in patients with clinically active disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tissue expression of E-selectin was enhanced in patients with active <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, with weak or absent expression in inactive disease and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In-111 labelled anti-E-selectin scintiscans were compared with Tc-99m labelled leucocyte scans performed 24 hours earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients had areas of active <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> on leucocyte scan while 11 patients had positive E-selectin scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of the two scans were concordant in 14 patients, with those positive for both (10/17) showing similar disease localisation and extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Tissue E-selectin and circulating sE-selectin are increased during active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anti-E-selectin imaging with radiolabelled monoclonal antibody identified areas of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The technique should prove useful clinically for identifying the site and extent of disease </plain></SENT>
