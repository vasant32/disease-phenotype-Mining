<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas only diploid DNA histograms were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and control subjects, three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> exhibited DNA <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In one case, <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> was associated with low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>S-phase fractions were higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (mean (SD) 17.8 (7.7)%) than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (13.1 (4.6)%) or control subjects (14.2 (4.6)%), but did not correlate with either disease activity or duration in any group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> was associated exclusively with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, even in the absence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In view of the epidemiological differences in malignant colonic transformation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, this study suggests that flow cytometry may help to identify individuals with an increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
