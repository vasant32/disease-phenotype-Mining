<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 30 UC patients, 15 without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (group II) and 15 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (group III), in addition to 15 healthy volunteers (group I, control subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique was used to measure serum p53Abs and MTs, while advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs), and reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) levels were measured by spectrophotometric method in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In group II and group III compared to group I, there were significant increases in serum levels of AOPPs (145.94 ± 29.86 μmol/L and 192.21 ± 46.71 μmol/L vs 128.95 ± 3.06 μmol/L, P &lt; 0.002 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively), MTs (8.18 ± 0.35 μg/mL and 9.20 ± 0.58 μg/mL vs 6.12 ± 0.25 μg/mL, P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.05, respectively), and p53Abs (20.19 ± 3.20 U/mL and 34.66 ± 1.34 U/mL vs 9.42 ± 1.64 U/mL, P &lt; 0.001 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were significantly higher levels of AOPPs (P &lt; 0.05) and p53Abs (P &lt; 0.001) in UC patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> compared to those without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, while MTs showed no significant difference between the 2 groups (P &gt; 0.096) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, GSH levels showed a significant decrease in both patients' groups (1.87 ± 0.02 μmol/mL and 1.37 ± 0.09 μmol/mL vs 2.49 ± 0.10 μmol/mL, P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.05 in groups II and III, respectively) compared with group I, and the levels were significantly lower in group III than group II (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a positive correlation between AOPPs and both MTs (r = 0.678, P &lt; 0.001) and p53Abs (r = 0.547, P &lt; 0.001), and also between p53Abs and MTs (r = 0.739, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a negative correlation between AOPPs and GSH (r = -0.385, P &lt; 0.001), and also between GSH and both MTs (r = -0.662, P &lt; 0.001) and p53Abs (r = -0.923, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> and oxidative cellular damage play an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> UC and the associated carcinogenetic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>p53Abs levels could help in early detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in these conditions </plain></SENT>
