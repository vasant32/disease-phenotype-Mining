<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-two male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into four groups (n=8): <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group; UC control group; UC+ST36 group and UC+non-acupoint group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A solution containing <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063">2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi>) was instilled into the distal colon in the rat (at a dose of 100 mg/kg) to set up UC rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats in wakefulness state of UC+ST36 group were stimulated at ST36 by EA once a day, while those of UC+non-acupoint group were done at 0.5 cm beside ST36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 10 d treatment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats were sacrificed simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Colon musocal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and damage were assessed by measuring colon mass, morphologic damage score, colonic myeloperoxidase enzyme (MPO) activity, serum TNF-alpha and colonic TNF-alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Morphologic damage score was examined under stereomicroscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Colonic MPO activity was measured by spectrophotometer method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum TNF-alpha concentration was determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Colonic TNF-alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression level was analyzed by semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ratio of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic mass</z:e>/body mass (m(C)/m(B)) and activity of colonic MPO (microkat/g tissue) markedly increased (8.5+/-2.6 vs 2.5+/-0.4; 145+/-25 vs 24+/-8, P&lt;0.01 vs <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control rats, serum TNF-alpha and colonic TNF-alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level in UC control group were increased 2.5 fold (2 278+/-170 vs 894+/-248, P&lt;0.01) and 4.3 fold (0.98+/-0.11 vs 0.23+/-0.11, P&lt;0.01), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After EA at ST36, m(C)/m(B) and MPO activity were reduced significantly (5.3+/-2.0 vs 8.5+/-2.6; 104+/-36 vs 145+/-25, P&lt;0.01, 0.05) compared with those of UC control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Serum TNF-alpha and colonic TNF-alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level were inhibited by EA stimulation at ST36 (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory rate was 16 % and 44 %, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Morphologic damage score was also increased markedly in rat with UC (P&lt;0.01), whereas it was decreased by EA at ST36 (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between UC control group and UC+EA at non-acupoint (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these parameters were highly correlated with each other (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Serum TNF-alpha concentration and colonic TNF-alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression level are increased significantly in UC rats in correlation with the severity of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>It indicates that TNF-alpha is closely involved in the immune abnormalities and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>EA at ST36 has therapeutic effect on UC by downregulating serum TNF-alpha and colonic TNF-alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>High levels of TNF-alpha and its corresponding <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression seem to be implicated in the pathogenesis of UC </plain></SENT>
