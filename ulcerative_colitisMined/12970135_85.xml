<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: An increased incidence of paediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> was reported recently by our group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To assess the incidence and characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) in northern Stockholm between 1990 and 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> records of individuals 0-15 years of age with suspected IBD in the population based catchment area of 180000 individuals were scrutinised using defined diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient files were searched for relatives with IBD, and for concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 152 children were diagnosed with IBD, corresponding to an overall incidence (per 100000) of IBD of 7.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) was 4.9, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) 2.2, and indeterminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> 0.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Between 1990 and 2001, there was a marked increase in the incidence of CD while the incidence of UC was almost unchanged, leading to a net increase in the overall occurrence of IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a male dominance of CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fourteen per cent and 11% of patients with CD and UC, respectively, had a first or second degree relative with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eighteen per cent and 10% of patients with CD and UC, respectively, had a concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with CD (10%) underwent surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of CD has increased in northern Stockholm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The current incidence is higher than that reported from other areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest a shift in presentation and diagnosis from UC towards CD, but also a net increase in IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> and family history are common in paediatric IBD </plain></SENT>
