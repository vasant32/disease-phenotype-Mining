<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Recent studies on appendicectomy rates in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> have generally not addressed the effect of appendicectomy on disease characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to compare appendicectomy rates in Australian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> patients and matched controls, and to evaluate the effect of prior appendicectomy on disease characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were ascertained from the Brisbane <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Inflammatory Bowel Disease</z:e> database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Controls matched for age and sex were randomly selected from the Australian Twin Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disease characteristics included age at diagnosis, disease site, need for immunosuppression, and intestinal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study confirmed the significant negative association between appendicectomy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (odds ratio (OR) 0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14-0.38; p&lt;0.0001) and found a similar result for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> once the bias of appendicectomy at diagnosis was addressed (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.23-0.51; p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prior appendicectomy delayed age of presentation for both diseases and was statistically significant for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, patients with prior appendicectomy had clinically milder disease with reduced requirement for immunosuppression (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02-1.15; p=0.04) and proctocolectomy (p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with patients without prior appendicectomy, appendicectomy before diagnosis delays disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and gives rise to a milder disease phenotype in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
