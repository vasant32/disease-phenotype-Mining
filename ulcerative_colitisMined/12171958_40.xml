<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In mice, the B lymphocyte chemoattractant (BLC) CXC chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13) is sufficient to induce a series of events leading to the formation of organised lymphoid tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its receptor, CXCR5, is required for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development of secondary lymphoid tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the human counterpart, B cell attracting chemokine 1 (BCA-1) has only been detected in the stomach and appendix and not in other parts of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or diseased gut </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hence to elucidate the potential role of this chemokine and its receptor in human gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), we analysed their expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intestine and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Frozen sections of surgical specimens were studied by multicolour immunofluorescence staining, in situ <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> hybridisation, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BCA-1 mRNA was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic and UC specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BCA-1 was produced and accumulated in relation to peripheral dendritic elements of lymphoid follicles in Peyer's patches and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon, as well as in irregular lymphoid aggregates in UC lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BCA-1 was partially associated with the traditional follicular dendritic <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> but also with extracellular fibrils in GALT structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CXCR5 protein was expressed by mantle zone B cells and appeared at a high level on scattered germinal centre T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BCA-1 and CXCR5 are expressed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GALT structures as well as in irregular lymphoid aggregates in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This strongly suggests that BCA-1 plays an important role not only in the formation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GALT but also in the generation of aberrant lymphoid tissue in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
