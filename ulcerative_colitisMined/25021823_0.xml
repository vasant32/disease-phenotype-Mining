<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>([1]) Typical non-specific symptoms lead to late diagnosis and poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aim to establish a better understanding of the natural history and genetic features of SBC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A regional UK <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry identified local SBC patients diagnosed from January 1991 to January 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed medical records collecting data on patient demographics, environmental and medical risk factors, family history, natural disease progression and immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The registry identified 205 SBC patients, 58% male and 42% female, who were diagnosed at a mean age of 63 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> (23.3%, n = 60), altered bowel habit (16.7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (15.0%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021843" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">bowel obstruction</z:e> (15.0%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> (13.3%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (10.0%) and other (6.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Investigations included CT (85.7%, n = 35), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> (8.6%) and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> (11.4%) imaging; gastroscopy (37.1%) that detected 8 of 9 duodenal SBCs and were reported <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 2 jejunal and 2 ileal SBCs, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="28534">DBE</z:chebi> (2.9%) and ERCP (2.9%) that detected 1 duodenal SBC each; emergency (8.6%) and staging laparotomy (8.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SBC anatomical and histological distributions are described in Table 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients were diagnosed at disease stage I (11.4%, n = 35), II (22.9%), III (20.0%) and IV (45.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment included curative surgery (66%, n = 38; 12 resections, 7 bypasses and 6 Whipple procedures and adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) in 20%) with a 60% success rate and recurrence in 16.7% within a year; palliative surgery (18.4%; 6 bypasses and AC in 66.7%) and medical palliation (15.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mortality rates at 1, 2, 5 and 10 years were 74.3%, 79.8%, 91.7% and 98.2% respectively (n = 109) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Environmental factors included smoking (47%, n = 53) and drinking alcohol (51.1%, n = 45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Co-morbidities included <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcer</z:hpo> disease (8.4%, n = 72), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coeliac disease</z:e> (4.2%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (1.4%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (1.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 23.6% of patients (n = 89) had â‰¥1 other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> that were metachronous (83.3%), synchronous (12.5%) or both (4.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Family history included a 1(st) or 2(nd) degree relative with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> (28.2%, n = 39) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">familial adenomatous polyposis</z:e> (7.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>IHC showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_271'>adenomatous polyposis coli</z:mpath> gene mutations in 42.1% (n = 19) and 40% (n = 10) respectively. gutjnl;63/Suppl_1/A267-b/T1F1T1 Abstract PTH-128 Table 1 Anatomical and histological distribution of SBC CONCLUSION: Our understanding of SBC is limited by its insidious course, difficult assessment and rarity coupled with multiple histological subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A more comprehensive understanding of SBC and it's genetic predisposition may allow high-risk patient stratification to earlier identify and treat SBC thus improving its poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
