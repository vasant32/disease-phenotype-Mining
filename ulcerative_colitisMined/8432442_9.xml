<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The drug was compared with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> in the management of active left sided or total <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and five patients were studied in the multicentre four week double blind study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">Prednisolone</z:chebi> was given in a dose of 40 mg daily orally, reducing over four weeks to 10 or 20 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31441">Fluticasone propionate</z:chebi> was given in an oral daily dose of 20 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was the investigator's overall assessment of response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patient's assessment, sigmoidoscopic appearance, and histology were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients improved more rapidly with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Differences between the two groups were significant at two weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At four weeks differences were not significant, but there was a trend in favour of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">Corticosteroid</z:chebi> side effects were minimal in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31441">fluticasone propionate</z:chebi> group, and there was minimal suppression of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31441">Fluticasone propionate</z:chebi> 20 mg daily is not as effective in the treatment of active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> as <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> tapering from 40 mg daily to 10 or 20 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The complete absence of suppression of the corticoadrenal axis by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31441">fluticasone propionate</z:chebi> was encouraging, however, and a higher dosage schedule should be assessed </plain></SENT>
