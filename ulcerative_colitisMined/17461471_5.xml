<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To identify potential susceptibility genes we performed global gene expression profiling in patients with IBD and control specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For determination of an intrinsic gene expression profile in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, mucosal biopsies of non-inflamed regions of the colon and the terminal ileum were subjected to DNA microarray analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were used for verification of selected regulated candidate genes and a genetic analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We could show that aquaporin-8 (AQP8) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels were significantly increased in the colon of UC patients compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genetic analysis of the six exons and the promoter region of AQP8, however, revealed no mutations or polymorphisms in IBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that upregulation of AQP8 in the colon of UC patients represents a secondary phenomenon which may, due to altered water exchange of the distal intestinal mucosa, disturb the physiologic colonic mucus barrier and thus lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and ulceration </plain></SENT>
