<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Potentially, a binding of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>) to dietary fibres could reduce the systemic absorption and increase the intraluminal amount [corrected] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purposes of the study were to investigate if: (1) dietary fibres can bind <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> in vitro, and (2) consumption of dietary fibres is related to disease activity in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In vitro: 15 g of Ispaghula Husk, wheat bran, citrus-<z:chebi fb="10" ids="17309">pectin</z:chebi>, or wheat flour were incubated in a 37°C buffered solutions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> (1 g/l) for 3 hours at pH 6 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> were determined before and after the incubation using HPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vivo: patients with UC were interviewed two to three times during 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fibre consumption was estimated and related to the disease activity (CAI, CRP, Faecal-calprotectin) and quality of life (IBDQ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In vitro: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> was bound to Ispaghula Husk (5.3-10.0 mg/g) and wheat bran (4.6-5.5 mg/g), and to a minor degree to citrus-<z:chebi fb="10" ids="17309">pectin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences were found in relation to pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vivo: 29 patients completed the scheduled interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant changes in fibre consumption were observed over time; however, patients consuming a diet high in fibre (&gt;20 g/day) had significantly lower CRP (p &lt;0.01) and faecal-calprotectin (p &lt;0.01) than those consuming less fibre (&lt;20 g/dg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a high intake of fibre had a lower disease activity than those with low intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ispaghula Husk bound <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> in vitro, independent of pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The effect might be clinically relevant in patients with UC treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
