<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has previously been shown that <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> is a useful disease activity marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>Microalbuminuria</z:mp> correlates strongly with the markers of clinical and laboratory disease activity such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C reactive protein (CRP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to discover if <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> accurately reflects the <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> by correlating it with <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> using a standard histopathological grading system in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty two patients with IBD who had undergone endoscopic examination of the entire colon for the assessment of severity and extent of the disease (Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (n = 21), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (n = 21)) were recruited to the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with small bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> were not studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty four patients had left sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">colonic disease</z:e> and 18 patients had extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">colonic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each patient's colonic biopsy specimens were scored blindly by a histopathologist and a composite score was compiled on the basis of the severity of changes in the enterocytes and crypts and the cellularity of the lamina propria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A clinical disease activity was obtained using the simple index of Harvey and Bradshaw </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>Microalbuminuria</z:mp> was measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients by an immunoturbiditimetric method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ESR and CRP were also measured, as indicators of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase response in the same patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It was found that patients with active IBD had higher concentrations of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> compared with those patients in remission (median 222 micrograms/min (range 40-686 micrograms/min) v median 96 micrograms/min (range 30-376 micrograms/min); p &lt; 0.001)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher concentrations of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> were also detected in patients with extensive colonic IBD compared with those patients with left sided disease (median 297 micrograms/min (range 132-686 micrograms/min) v median 101 micrograms/min (range 30-433 micrograms/min); p &lt; 0.001)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A strong positive correlation was seen between <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and intestinal histopathological score in IBD patient groups with left sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (r = 0.77; p &lt; 0.001) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849867" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">extensive disease</z:e> (r = 0.71; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The standard histopathological grading system correlated with the clinical disease activity (r = 0.64; p &lt; 0.005) and CRP (r = 0.62; p &lt; 0.02), however, it did not correlate with ESR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the strong correlation of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> with a standard intestinal histopathological grading system suggests that <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> accurately reflects the severity of colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in patients with Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
