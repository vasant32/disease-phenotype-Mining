<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To use microarray-based miRNA profiling of colonic mucosal biopsies from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), and controls in order to identify new potential miRNA biomarkers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Colonic mucosal pinch biopsies from the descending part were obtained endoscopically from patients with active UC or CD, quiescent UC or CD, as well as healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was isolated and miRNA expression assessed using the miRNA microarray Geniom Biochip miRNA Homo sapiens (Febit GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data analysis was carried out by principal component analysis and projection to latent structure-discriminant analysis using the SIMCA-P+12 software package (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The microarray data were subsequently validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) performed on colonic tissue samples from active UC patients (n = 20), patients with quiescent UC (n = 19), and healthy controls (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The qPCR results were analyzed with Mann-Whitney U test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In silico prediction analysis were performed to identify potential miRNA target genes and the predicted miRNA targets were then compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> UC associated susceptibility genes reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The colonic mucosal miRNA transcriptome differs significantly between UC and controls, UC and CD, as well as between UC patients with mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, no clear differences in the transcriptome of patients with CD and controls were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The miRNAs with the strongest differential power were identified (miR-20b, miR-99a, miR-203, miR-26b, and miR-98) and found to be up-regulated more than a 10-fold in active UC as compared to quiescent UC, CD, and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two miRNAs, miR-125b-1* and let-7e*, were up-regulated more than 5-fold in quiescent UC compared to active UC, CD, and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four of the seven miRNAs (miR-20b, miR-98, miR-125b-1*, and let-7e*) were validated by qPCR and found to be specifically upregulated in patients with UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Using in silico analysis we found several predicted pro-inflammatory target genes involved in various pathways, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase and cytokine signaling, which are both key signaling pathways in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study provides the first evidence that miR-20b, miR-98, miR-125b-1*, and let-7e* are deregulated in patients with UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The level of these miRNAs may serve as new potential biomarkers for this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
