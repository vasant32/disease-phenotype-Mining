<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, 102 UC patients (53 Han including 22 men and 31 women, and 49 Uyghur patients including 25 men and 24 women; aged 48.07 Â± 15.83 years) and 310 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled in the Department of Gastroenterology, Xinjiang People's Hospital of China from January 2010 to May 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>UC was diagnosed based on the clinical, endoscopic and histological findings following Lennard-Jones criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were collected and genomic DNA was extracted by routine laboratory methods, and both polymerase chain reaction and gene sequencing were used to identify HLA-DRB1 allele variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The potential association between genetic variation and UC in Han and Uyghur patients was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no statistical differences in HLA-DRB1 allele frequencies in Han UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the sex ratio between the controls and UC patients (P = 0.740) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Han patients with UC (n = 53), HLA-DRB1 *03, *13 allele frequencies were lower than in healthy controls (n = 161), but not statistically significant, and HLA-DRB1*04*11*14 allele frequencies were higher than in healthy controls, but without statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Differences between Uyghur UC patients and the control group were observed for HLA-DRB1*04 and HLA-DRB1*13, both showed a greater frequency in UC patients (10.21% vs 2.69%, P = 0.043; 14.29% vs 4.03%, P = 0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HLA-DRB1*14 also showed a greater frequency in UC patients (14.29% vs 2.69%, P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of DRB1*04, *13*14 alleles were increased in Uyghur UC patients compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The frequency of DRB1 * 08 was decreased in Uyghur UC patients compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>HLA-DRB1 alleles showed no association with UC in Han patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no statistical differences in HLA-DRB1 allele frequencies in Han UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of DRB1*04, *13*14 alleles were increased in Uyghur UC patients compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The frequency of DRB1*08 was decreased in Uyghur UC patients compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Polymorphism of the HLA-DRB1 gene may contribute to the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of UC between Han and Uyghur UC patients in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HLA-DRB1*04*13*14 and DRB1*08 may contribute to the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of UC between Han and Uyghur UC patients </plain></SENT>
