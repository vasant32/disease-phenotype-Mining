<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to determine the comparative usefulness of inflammatory markers, in evaluating disease activity in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was assessed by the Mayo Clinic score for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and Harvey-Bradshaw score for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five hundred <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood donors who had no underlying inflammatory condition served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The erythrocyte sedimentation rate, platelet and white blood cell count, C reactive protein, and the leucocyte adhesiveness/aggregation test (LAAT) were determined in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred and twenty four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> were tested while in remission and 128 in relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their mean (SD) per cent of aggregated white blood cells in the peripheral blood was 8 (5) and 17 (10) respectively compared with controls 6 (4) (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the LAAT could effectively discriminate between various grades of disease activity, the values in patients with active disease being 13 (6)% in mild, 17 (10)% in moderate, and 26 (10)% in severe disease (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase reactants including the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, the white blood cell count, the platelet count, neutrophil count, as well as, the C reactive protein concentration did not differentiate as well between the various groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using logistic regression analysis to differentiate between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> patients in remission or relapse, the LAAT was the single best indicator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The addition of any other test did not contribute to the discrimination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the different laboratory variables tested only the LAAT significantly discriminated between the five different subgroups of controls, remission and mild, moderate or severe disease activity </plain></SENT>
