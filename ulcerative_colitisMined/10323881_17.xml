<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To compare affected parent-child pairs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> with a control group of non-familial patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) in order to quantify whether ascertainment bias could account for this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 137 affected parent-child pairs from 96 families and 214 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> IBD were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and diagnosis were ascertained by interview and disease confirmed from clinical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 137 affected parent-child pairs, 50 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> only, 51 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> only, and in 36, one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and the other <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median age of parents at diagnosis was 17.5 years older, 16 years older, and 18 years older in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and mixed disease families respectively (p&lt;0.001 in each case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observed age differences were compatible with those predicted from the regression lines of years of birth against age at diagnosis for the non-familial IBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No evidence was found for an effect of parental sex on age at diagnosis or disease extent in offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003743'>genetic anticipation</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> of age at diagnosis in this sample of IBD families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ascertainment bias is responsible for the age differences at diagnosis between affected parents and children </plain></SENT>
