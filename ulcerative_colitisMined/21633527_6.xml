<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recruited 153 patients: 82 with UC, 26 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and 43 disease controls [non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects were excluded if they had diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The serum levels of sST2 and pro-inflammatory cytokines [pg/mL; median (25th-75th)] as well as clinical features, endoscopic and histological features, were subjected to analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sST2 performance for discrimination between active and inactive UC, non-IBD and healthy controls (HC) was determined with regard to sensitivity and specificity, and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (r) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To validate the method, the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) was determined (AUC, 95% CI) and the total ST2 content of the colonic mucosa in UC patients was correlated with circulating levels of sST2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The serum sST2 value was significantly higher in patients with active [235.80 (90.65-367.90) pg/mL] rather than inactive UC [33.19 (20.04-65.32) pg/mL], based on clinical, endoscopic and histopathological characteristics, as well as compared with non-IBD and HC (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median level of sST2 in CD patients was 54.17 (35.02-122.0) pg/mL, significantly higher than that of the HC group only (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cutoff was set at 74.87 pg/mL to compare active with inactive UC in a multicenter cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Values of sensitivity, specificity, and ability to correctly classify UC, according to activity, were 83.33%, 83.33% and 83.33%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The AUC of the ROC curve to assess the ability of this molecule to discriminate between active vs inactive UC was 0.92 (0.86-0.97, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The serum levels of sST2 in patients with UC significantly correlated with endoscopic and histopathological scores (r = 0.76 and r = 0.67, P &lt; 0.0001, respectively), and with the pro-inflammatory cytokine, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-Î± (r = 0.69 and r = 0.61, respectively, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we found a direct correlation between total intestinal ST2 content and serum levels of sST2, adjusted to endoscopic activity score in patients with mild (r = 0.44, P = 0.004), moderate (r = 0.59, P = 0.002) and severe disease (r = 0.82, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Only patients with inactive UC showed no significant correlation (r = 0.45, P = 0.267) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: sST2 levels correlated with disease severity and inflammatory cytokines, are able to differentiate active from inactive UC and might have a role as a biomarker </plain></SENT>
