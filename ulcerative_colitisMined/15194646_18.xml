<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Appendicectomy and smoking are environmental factors that are known to influence <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The phenotype of UC is different in patients with coexistent primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> (PSC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigates the interaction of appendicectomy and PSC on the epidemiology and clinical behaviour of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were from the Brisbane IBD Research Group database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Controls were from the Australian twin registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy eight PSC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (PSC-IBD) patients, 12 pure PSC, and 294 UC patients were matched with 1466 controls by sex and birth cohort that comprised randomly selected twins from each twin pair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effects of appendicectomy, smoking, or PSC on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of disease, disease extent, disease severity (as identified by immunosuppression-colectomy or liver transplant), and disease related complications (high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_354'>cholangiocarcinoma</z:mpath>) were investigated using univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PSC-IBD patients had a more extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> than UC patients (p&lt;0.0001) but required less immunosuppression (p = 0.007), which was independent of disease extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They were more likely to have high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (p = 0.029) than UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Appendicectomy rates in the PSC groups were not different from the control groups (p = 0.72, 0.76), which was in sharp contrast with UC where the rate was four times less (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prior appendicectomy appeared to be associated with an approximate five year delay in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of intestinal (PSC-IBD or UC) or hepatic (PSC) disease, which was independent of smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Appendicectomy did not independently alter the extent or severity of disease in PSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, prior appendicectomy in UC was associated with more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849867" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">extensive disease</z:e> but with a lesser requirement for immunosuppression or colectomy for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were trends for high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with appendicectomy in both PSC-IBD and UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although these trends were not statistically significant, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> appeared more frequent with appendicectomy in a meta-analysis of the available UC data from this and another Australian study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In contradistinction to UC, appendicectomy did not significantly influence the prevalence of the PSC groups, or the extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in PSC-IBD, but as with UC, did appear to delay their <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The extensive milder <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, which is characteristic of PSC-IBD, relates to other poorly understood factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Further prospective studies are required to determine any influence of appendicectomy on the extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in IBD and an associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
