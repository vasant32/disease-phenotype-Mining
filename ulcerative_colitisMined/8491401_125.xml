<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Jewish population has an increased frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> compared with their non-Jewish neighbours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic factors have been implicated in the aetiology of this disorder and may contribute to ethnic differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study determined the familial empirical risks for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> in the first degree relatives of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> probands (for both Jews and non-Jews) for the purpose of accurate genetic counselling and genetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 527 inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel disease</z:e> patients from Southern California (291 Jews and 236 non-Jews) were questioned about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> in their first degree relatives (a total of 2493 individuals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> has a variable and late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, age specific incidence data were used to estimate the life time risks and to make valid comparisons between the different groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the first degree relatives of non-Jewish probands, the life time risks for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> were 5.2% and 1.6% when probands had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These values were consistently lower than the corresponding risks for relatives of Jewish patients -7.8% and 4.5% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> probands respectively (p value for comparison between Jews and non-Jews: 0.028; between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>: 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data provide the requisite basis for genetic counselling for these disorders in the white American population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, these different empirical risks for relatives of Jewish and non-Jewish probands allow rejection of single Mendelian gene models for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, but are consistent with several alternative genetic models </plain></SENT>
