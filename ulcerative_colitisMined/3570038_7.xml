<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is of value for the management of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> but may be associated with increasing diarrhoea in a few </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examines the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> and ADS on small intestinal transport systems of the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Krebs-Ringer-bicarbonate solution was circulated through the lumen of a jejunal segment and the appearance of fluid, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> on the serosal surface was shown to be linear over a two hour period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> (10 mmol/l) or ADS (5 mmol/l and 10 mmol/l) caused a significant inhibition both of fluid transport (p less than 0.001), and of the appearance of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (p less than 0.001) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> (p less than 0.001 for 5 mmol/l and 10 mmol/l ADS, p less than 0.01 for 10 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The uptake of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> by rings of rat jejunum was shown to be markedly reduced by ADS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Experiments substituting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> with either <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27971">2-aminoisobutyric acid</z:chebi> showed that ADS (5 mmol/l, 10 mmol/l) also inhibited the serosal appearance of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> and the amino acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> and ADS, at concentrations which could be expected in the jejunum of patients receiving therapeutic doses, are able to inhibit small intestinal transport systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The resulting increase in load on the diseased colon could be important for the pathogenesis of diarrhoea </plain></SENT>
