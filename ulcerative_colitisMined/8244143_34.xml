<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> is an important energy source for the distal colon, and that its metabolism may be defective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A similar metabolic defect in the ileum might account for the occurrence of '<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e>' in UC patients after colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A method has been developed that allows the measurement of metabolism in ileocolonoscopic biopsy specimens, and this has been used to assess <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> and glutamine metabolism in quiescent UC and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preliminary experiments showed optimal metabolism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> at 1 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In controls glutamine metabolism was greater in the ascending (mean (SD)) (4.9 (3.2) nmol/h/micrograms protein) than in the descending colon (1.4 0.7)) (p &lt; 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test), but <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> metabolism was similar in the two regions (ascending 62.6 (44.2), descending 51.5 (32.0)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consequently ratios of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>/glutamine metabolism were higher in the descending colon (20.6 (14.3)) than in the ascending colon (14.3 (9.6)) (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In UC, rates of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> metabolism were similar in the ascending (92.5 (58.3) nmol/h/micrograms protein) and descending (93.3 (115)) colon, and these were not significantly different from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In UC, glutamine metabolism was similar in the ascending (6.2 (7.7) nmol/h/micrograms protein) and descending colon (7.8 (7.9)); the metabolism in the descending colon was significantly greater than in controls (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">Butyrate</z:chebi> (135 (56) nmol/h/microgram protein) and glutamine (24.1 (16.2)) metabolism in the ileum in UC, were not significantly different from control values (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> 111 (57), glutamine 15.5 (15.6)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results confirm that there is regional variation of nutrient utilisation throughout the colon, but they do not support the hypothesis that UC is caused by a deficiency of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
