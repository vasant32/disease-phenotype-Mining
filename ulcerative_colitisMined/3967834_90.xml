<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The period of observation ranged from one to 18 years with a median of 6.7 years for the clinical observations, eight years for survival and 11.6 years for the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="CRC">large bowel cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The follow up was 100% for both survival and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The survival rate in women did not differ from that in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In men over 40 years of age at diagnosis a slight excess mortality was found, but only in the year of diagnosis (2.1%) and the following year (1.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colonic cancer</z:e> was seen in only seven out of the 783 patients, corresponding to an annual risk of 0.07% and a cumulative risk after 18 years with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> of 1.4% (95% confidence limits, 0.7-2.8%) independent of the initial extent of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The colectomy rate was 9.6% in the year of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cumulative 10- and 18-year colectomy rate was 23% and 31%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After three years from diagnosis the capacity for work both in those subject to resection and treated conservatively did not differ significantly from that in the background population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At any time about 50% of the patients were without symptoms, in about 30% the disease activity was low and in about 20% moderate or high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most patients, however, differed in activity from one year to another and almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (97%) experienced at least one relapse during a 10 year time period </plain></SENT>
