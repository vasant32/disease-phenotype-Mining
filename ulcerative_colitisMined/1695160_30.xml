<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mast cell <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> release was measured in 19 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> using gut mast cells from enzymatically dispersed endoscopic forceps biopsy specimens of macroscopically inflamed and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mast cells and corresponding basophils were challenged with anti-IgE, anti-IgG, subclass anti-IgG4, and formyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32648">methionyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32630">leucyl</z:chebi>-phenylalanine (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">FMLP</z:chebi>) and results were compared with those from nine patient control subjects </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, mast cells did not respond to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">FMLP</z:chebi> but the corresponding basophils did </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the anti-IgG4 mediated <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> release was primarily confined to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
