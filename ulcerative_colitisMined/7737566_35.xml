<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Faecal mucin sulphatase activity assayed using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi> mucin as substrate was increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (median 80.2 units/g pellet weight (range 6.9-1063; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 45.2 to 293.8, n = 22) compared with 11.3 units/g (range 3.0-53.5; 95% CI: 8.7 to 29.8, n = 17) in healthy controls (p &lt; 0.01), where one unit released 1000 dpm free <z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi>/hour from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi> mucin (1680 dpm/microgram) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> had higher sulphatase activity (median 146; 95% CI: 98 to 253 units/g, n = 10) than those with inactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (median 42.2; CI: 22.5 to 81.6 units/g, n = 12) (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increased faecal mucin sulphatase activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> could be the result of greater intraluminal substrate (mucin) availability leading to <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> enzyme induction, but would probably result in more rapid degradation of secreted mucin and represents a potential target for treatment </plain></SENT>
