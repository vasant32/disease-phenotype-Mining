<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Conflicting results exist about the presence of Mycobacterium avium subspecies <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paratuberculosis</z:e> (MAP) specific IS900 DNA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined IS900 in a large number of gut samples from patients with CD (n = 100) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC, n = 100), and in non-inflamed control tissues (nIBD, n = 100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that IS900 DNA detection might be associated with distinct clinical phenotypic characteristics in CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The prevalence of MAP DNA in surgically resected tissues was examined using a mechanical-enzymatic disruption technique and nested IS900 specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD patients were stratified according to the criteria of the Vienna classification and other clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IS900 PCR detection rate was significantly higher in CD tissue samples (52%) than in UC (2%) or nIBD (5%) specimens (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In CD patients, IS900 DNA was detected in samples from both diseased small bowel (47%) as well as from the colon (61%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No firm association between MAP specific IS900 detection rates and clinical phenotypic characteristics in CD could be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> medication constituted a factor which tended to have a negative influence on IS900 DNA detection rates in CD (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of MAP specific IS900 DNA is a predominant feature of CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic intervention against MAP might represent a potential target for disease mitigation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
