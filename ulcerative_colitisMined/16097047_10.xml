<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To observe different histomorphologic changes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) rats that were treated with four regulating-intestine prescriptions (FRIP), to investigate the curative effects of FRIP and to analyze their treatment mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The UC rat model was made by the method of 2,4-dinitro chloro <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34718">DNCB</z:chebi>) immunity and <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> local enema </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ninety-eight SD rats were randomly divided into seven groups, namely, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group, model group, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9334">salicylazosulfapyridine</z:chebi> (SASP) group, Wumeiwan (WMW) group, Baitouwengtang (BTWT) group, Senglingbaishusan (SLBSS) group, and Tongxieyaofang (TXYF) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each group had 14 rats (with equal ratio of male and female) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The six animal model groups of UC -SASP, TXYF, WMW, BTWT, SLBSS, TXYF-were treated by distilled water except the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes of the rat's general conditions after treatment were respectively observed, the colon tissue damage scores were given out, the pathology of colonic mucosa and changes of ultrastructure were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Different pathological changes on histology were shown after treatment by FRIP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The colon tissue damage score in model group was higher than that of FRIP groups and SASP group (q = 4.59, 4.77, P&lt;0.05 or q = 5.48, 6.25, 5.97, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The scores of WMW group, BTWT group and SLBSS group were lower than that of SASP (q = 4.13, P&lt;0.05 or q = 5.31, 5.12, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no remarkable difference between the damage score of TXYF group and SASP group (q = 3.75, P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, some <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> cells were found in the pathologic control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The model made with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34718">DNCB</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> was successful, and FRIP had better curative effect and WMW was the best curative effect, BTW, SLBSS and TXYF were similar to SASP, and we discovered that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was possibly related to UC </plain></SENT>
