<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rectal mucosa biopsies were collected from 15 UC patients and 17 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD5(+) B cells were analysed by three colour flow cytometry from rectal mucosal samples after mechanical disaggregation by Medimachine(®) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of B and T lymphocytes was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Correlations between, on the one hand, rectal B1a cell concentrations and, on the other, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels and clinical, endoscopic and histological disease activity indices were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rectal B-lymphocyte (CD19(+)/CD45(+)) rate and concentration were higher in UC patients compared with those in healthy controls (47.85% ± 3.12% vs 26.10% ± 3.40%, P = 0.001 and 501 ± 91 cells/mm(2) vs 117 ± 18 cells/mm(2), P &lt; 0.001); Rectal B1a cell density (CD5(+)CD19(+)) was higher in UC patients than in healthy controls (85 ± 15 cells/mm(2) vs 31 ± 6.7 cells/mm(2), P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rectal B1a cell (CD5/CD19(+)) rate correlated inversely with endoscopic classification (Rs = -0.637, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: B1a lymphocytes seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of UC, however, the role they play in its early phases and in disease activity, have yet to be defined </plain></SENT>
