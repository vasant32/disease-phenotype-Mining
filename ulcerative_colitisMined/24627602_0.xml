<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate if the presence of relevant genetic polymorphisms has effect on the effectual clearance of bacteria by monocytes and granulocytes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, we assessed the differential responses in phagocytosis by measuring the phagocytic activity and the percentage of active phagocytic monocytes and granulocytes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> patients as well as healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As both autophagy related like 1 (ATG16L1) and immunity-related <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">guanosine</z:chebi> triphosphatase gene are autophagy genes associated with CD and more recently nucleotide-binding ligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) has been identified as a potent inducer of autophagy we genotyped the patients for these variants and correlated this to the phagocytic reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The genotyping was done with restriction fragment length polymorphisms analysis and the phagocytosis was determined with the pHrodo™ Escherichia coli Bioparticles Phagocytosis kit for flowcytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrate that analysis of the monocyte and granulocyte populations of patients with CD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> showed a comparable phagocytic activity (ratio of mean fluorescence intensity) between the patient groups and the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD patients show a significantly higher phagocytic capacity (ratio mean percentage of phagocytic cells) compared to healthy controls (51.91% ± 2.85% vs 37.67% ± 7.06%, P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The extend of disease was not of influence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, variants of ATG16L1 (WT: 2.03 ± 0.19 vs homozygoot variant: 4.38 ± 0.37, P &lt; 0.009) as well as NOD2 (C-ins) (heterozygous variant: 42.08 ± 2.94 vs homozygous variant: 75.58 ± 4.34 (P = 0.05) are associated with the phagocytic activity in patients with CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Monocytes of CD patients show enhanced phagocytosis associated with the presence of ATG16L1 and NOD2 variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This could be part of the pathophysiological mechanism resulting in the disease </plain></SENT>
