<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To examine the expression of matrix metallo-proteinase-1 (MMP-1) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in the colon mucosa of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry were used to examine the expression of MMP-1 and TNF-alpha at both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels in the colon mucosa of patients with UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Correlation between MMP-1 and TNF-alpha and their correlation with the severity of the disease were also analyzed statistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expression of MMP-1 and TNF-alpha in the ulcerated and inflamed colon mucosa of patients with UC was significantly higher than that in the non-inflamed mucosa of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls at both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the expression of MMP-1 and TNF-alpha in the ulcerated area was significantly higher than that in the inflamed area of patients with UC (0.9797 +/- 0.1433 vs 0.6746 +/- 0.0373, 0.8669 +/- 0.0746 vs 0.5227 +/- 0.0435, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference in the non-inflamed area of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between MMP-1 and TNF-alpha expression (0.9797 +/- 0.1433 vs 0.8669 +/- 0.0746, P &lt; 0.05), the correlating factor was 0.877 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MMP-1 and TNF-alpha showed a significant correlation with the severity of the disease (0.0915 +/- 0.0044 vs 0.0749 +/- 0.0032 , 0.0932 +/- 0.0019 vs 0.0724 +/- 0.0043, P &lt; 0.05), their correlating factors were 0.942 and 0.890, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Excessively expressed MMP-1 directly damages the colon mucosa by degrading extracellular matrix (ECM) in patients with UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While damaging colon mucosa, excessively expressed TNF-alpha stimulates MMPs secreting cells to produce more MMP-1 and aggravates the mucosa damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MMP-1 promotes secretion of TNF-alpha in a positive feedback manner to cause further injury in the colon mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MMP-1 and TNF-alpha correlate well with the severity of the disease, and therefore, can be used clinically as biological markers to judge the severity of UC </plain></SENT>
