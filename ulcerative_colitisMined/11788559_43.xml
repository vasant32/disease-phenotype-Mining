<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of this effect however is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Suppression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNF-alpha) by thalidomide has been suggested as a possible mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, effects on other cytokines have not been adequately investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of thalidomide on cytokine production in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten patients with therapy refractory IBD (nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, one <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>) received thalidomide 300 mg daily in a 12 week open label study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Production of TNF-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-12 was investigated in short term cultures of stimulated colonic lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) and peripheral blood monocytes (PBMC) before and after 12 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LPMC were also cultured with graded doses of thalidomide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three patients discontinued treatment because of sedative side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the other patients, disease activity decreased significantly, with four patients achieving remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Production of TNF-alpha and IL-12 decreased during treatment with thalidomide: LPMC (TNF-alpha: 42.3 (8.3) pg/ml v 16.4 (6.3); IL-12: 9.7 (3.3) v 5.0 (2.5); p&lt;0.04) and PBMC (TNF-alpha: 62.8 (14.6) v 22.5 (9.2); p&lt;0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Production of IL-1 beta and IL-6 did not change significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Culturing of LPMC with thalidomide showed a dose dependent decrease in TNF-alpha and IL-12 production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The clinical effects of thalidomide in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> may be mediated by reduction of both TNF-alpha and IL-12 </plain></SENT>
