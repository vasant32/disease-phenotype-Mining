<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine whether a semisynthetic form of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (sAKBA), the most potent anti-inflammatory component of the resin, also confers protection in experimental murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32149">sodium sulfate</z:chebi> (DSS) to compare its effects with those standard medications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> like steroids and to examine whether leukocyte-endothelial cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> is a major target of action of sAKBA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical measurements of disease activity and histology were used to assess disease progression, and intravital microscopy was employed to monitor the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of leukocytes and platelets in postcapillary venules of the inflamed colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>sAKBA treatment significantly blunted disease activity as assessed both grossly and by histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the recruitment of adherent leukocytes and platelets into inflamed colonic venules was profoundly reduced in mice treated with sAKBA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because previous studies in the DSS model have shown that P-selectin mediates these blood cell-endothelial cell interactions, the expression of P-selectin in the colonic microcirculation was monitored using the dual-radiolabeled antibody technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The treatment of established <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> with sAKBA largely prevented the P-selectin upregulation normally associated with DSS <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the protective responses observed with sAKBA were comparable to that realized in mice treated with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrated an anti-inflammatory effect of sAKBA and indicated that P-selectin-mediated recruitment of inflammatory cells is a major site of action for this novel <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory agent</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
