<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the long-term outcomes of IFX treatment in patients with refractory UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-three patients with refractory UC who received IFX treatment at Kyoto University Hospital between 2003 and 2013 were retrospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IFX intensification was defined as a dose escalation (up to 10 mg/kg) and/or shorter intervals between infusions (every 4-6 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 33 patients who received scheduled infusions of IFX, 24 (72.7%) achieved clinical remission within 8 weeks after initiating IFX treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these 24 responders, 17 (70.8%) experienced a relapse of UC and required IFX intensification, and 16 (66.7%) eventually maintained clinical remission with IFX treatment, including IFX intensification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 33 patients, 6 (18.2%) underwent colectomy during IFX treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression analysis showed that a serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration &lt;5 mg/L two weeks after starting IFX was a predictor of a positive clinical response to IFX induction therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No severe adverse events occurred in UC patients treated with IFX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IFX intensification was necessary for long-term maintenance of remission and to prevent colectomy in patients with refractory UC </plain></SENT>
