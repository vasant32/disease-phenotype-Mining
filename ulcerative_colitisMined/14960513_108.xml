<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diseases have previously been regarded as rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present an epidemiological study of microscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in a well defined Swedish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were retrospectively searched for in colonoscopy reports of those who had a colonoscopy in the period 1993-1998 for non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151594" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bloody diarrhoea</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> colonic mucosal biopsies were reassessed using strict diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Biopsies from 1018 patients were reassessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty one (45 female) collagenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> patients and 46 (31 female) lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> patients were diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median age at diagnosis was 64 years in collagenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and 59 years in lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean annual incidence of collagenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> was 4.9/10(5) inhabitants (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.6-6.2/10(5)) and of lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> 4.4/10(5) inhabitants (95% CI 3.1-5.7/10(5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The annual incidence of collagenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> increased from 3.7/10(5) in 1993-1995 to 6.1/10(5) in 1996-1998 (difference 2.4/10(5) (95% CI -0.3-5.1/10(5))) whereas the incidence of lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> increased from 3.1/10(5) to 5.7/10(5) (difference 2.6/10(5) (95% CI 0.1-5.2/10(5))) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The annual incidences of collagenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> are higher than considered previously and are now equal to the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> in Sweden, and combined rates approach the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Microscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 10% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151594" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bloody diarrhoea</z:e> referred for colonoscopy and in almost 20% of those older than 70 years </plain></SENT>
