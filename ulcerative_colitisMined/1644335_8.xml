<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As an alternative therapy might be advantageous, the efficacy of six weeks' treatment with 2 g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27565">4-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi> (4-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) (n = 24) and 20 mg <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> enemas (n = 21) were compared in a double blind, randomised trial in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> distal (less than 30 cm from the anus) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the time of leaving the trial, 24 hour stool frequency, the presence of blood in the stools, and histological and sigmoidoscopic appearances were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic improvement occurred in 17 of 24 patients receiving 4-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> compared with 11 of 21 receiving <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> (chi 2 = 1.62, NS) </plain></SENT>
