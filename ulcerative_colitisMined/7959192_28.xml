<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The overall prevalence of H pylori seropositivity in the IBD patients was 22%, which was significantly less than that of 52% in the controls (p &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in prevalence between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and Crohn's patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The low seropositivity in the IBD patients resulted from a very low prevalence of 10% in those currently receiving sulphasalazine (n = 40) and similarly low prevalence of 7% in those previously receiving sulphasalazine (n = 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In those receiving olsalazine or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> and who had never had sulphasalazine, the prevalence of seropositivity was 45% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further studies using <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> breath test and microscopy of antral biopsy specimens confirmed that the negative serology in patients receiving sulphasalazine resulted from absence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rather than absence of humoral immune response to it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In six control patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">H pylori infection</z:e>, a two week course of sulphasalazine (500 mg four times daily) only caused slight suppression of the <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> breath test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies failed to show any direct antibacterial effect of sulphasalazine on H pylori </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that longterm treatment with sulphasalazine leads to eradication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">H pylori infection</z:e> and that this does not result from a direct antibacterial effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It may be caused by the drug treating the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> and thereby depriving the bacterium of essential nutrients exuded by the inflamed mucosa </plain></SENT>
