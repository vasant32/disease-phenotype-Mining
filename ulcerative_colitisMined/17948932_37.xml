<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the pathogenesis of IBD remains unclear, it is widely accepted that genetic, environmental, and immunological factors are involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that intestinal epithelial defenses are important to prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> by protecting against microbial pathogens and oxidative stresses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate the etiology of IBD, animal models of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> have been developed and are frequently used to evaluate new anti-inflammatory treatments for IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several models of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> that demonstrate various pathophysiological aspects of the human disease have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this manuscript, we review the characteristic features of IBD through a discussion of the various chemically induced experimental models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (e.g. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32149">sodium sulfate</z:chebi>-, 2,4,6-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48110">trinitrobenzene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29214">sulfonic acid</z:chebi>-, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53076">oxazolone</z:chebi>-, <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi>-, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi>-induced models) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also summarize some regulatory and pathogenic factors demonstrated by these models that can, hopefully, be exploited to develop future therapeutic strategies against IBD </plain></SENT>
