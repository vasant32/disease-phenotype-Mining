<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 157 <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, 88 (56%) occurred in the rectosigmoid, 19 (12%) in the descending colon or splenic flexure, and 50 (32%) in the proximal colon </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> was detected in 41 of 50 reviewed proctocolectomy specimens (82%) </plain></SENT>
