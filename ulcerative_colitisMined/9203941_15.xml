<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recently, the association of a polymorphism in the gene coding for the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was interpreted as a possible genetic predisposition for severity of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To examine this polymorphism in a southern German population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: The study included 234 healthy controls, 57 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, including 31 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0868908" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pancolitis</z:e>, 44 first degree healthy relatives of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and 65 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genotypes were determined by a polymerase chain reaction amplification of the intron 2 fragment harbouring a variable number of tandem repeat nucleotide sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Amplification products were separated on a 2% <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The allele frequency for allele 2 was 27% in healthy controls, 28% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, and 21% in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The same allele frequency (21%) was found in a subgroup of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> affecting the whole colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus for allele 2 as well as for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other alleles, genotypes, or carriage rates no significant differences were found compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> allele frequencies in the control population were similar to those in earlier studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No association of a polymorphism in the interleukin-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> gene with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> could be identified in this southern German population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The findings of an earlier study reporting an increased frequency of allele 2, particularly in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0868908" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pancolitis</z:e>, could not be confirmed </plain></SENT>
