<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Determination of inflammatory state is crucial for the assessment of disease activity and for tailoring therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, no simple diagnostic test for monitoring <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> is available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Noninvasive markers give only indirect assessments of disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histopathological or endoscopical examinations accurately assess inflammatory activity, but they are invasive, time consuming and expensive and therefore are unsuitable for routine use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Imaging procedures are not applicable for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The usefulness of ultrasound and Doppler imaging in assessing disease activity is still a matter of discussion for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, and an increased interest in computed tomography enterograph (CTE) has been seen, mainly because it can delineate the extent and severity of bowel wall <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, besides detecting extraluminal findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Until now, the available data concerning the accuracy of magnetic resonance enterography in detecting disease activity is less than CTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Due to this, clinical activity indices are still commonly used for both diseases </plain></SENT>
