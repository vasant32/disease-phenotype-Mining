<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence of the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in IBD is important for the management of pregnancy to assist in its management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To provide a clear assessment of risk of adverse outcomes during pregnancy in women with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The Medline literature was searched to identify studies reporting outcomes of pregnancy in patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Random-effect meta-analysis was used to compare outcomes between women with IBD and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients and SETTING: A total of 3907 patients with IBD (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> 1952 (63%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> 1113 (36%)) and 320 531 controls were reported in 12 studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For women with IBD, there was a 1.87-fold increase in incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e> (&lt;37 weeks gestation; 95% CI 1.52 to 2.31; p&lt;0.001) compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> (&lt;2500 g) was over twice that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (95% CI 1.38 to 3.19; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Women with IBD were 1.5 times more likely to undergo caesarean section (95% CI 1.26 to 1.79; p&lt;0.001), and the risk of congenital abnormalities was found to be 2.37-fold increased (95% CI 1.47 to 3.82; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The study has shown a higher incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes in patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to clarify which women are at higher risk, as this was not determined in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This has an effect on the management of patients with IBD during pregnancy, who should be treated as a potentially high-risk group </plain></SENT>
