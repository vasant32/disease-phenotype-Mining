<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> appears to be uncommon among Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) in Malaysian patients and to establish the spectrum of the disease seen in Malaysian patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three major Asian races: Malay, Chinese, and Indian co-exist in Malaysia and we sought to determine if there were any racial differences in the prevalence and presentation of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Racial differences for several other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal diseases</z:e> have previously been observed and found to be extremely interesting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were obtained retrospectively from a review of the medical records of in- and out-patients with a diagnosis of UC at the University Hospital, Kuala Lumpur between 1985 and 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 45 confirmed cases of UC of which 3 were foreigners, who were excluded from analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty new cases of UC were diagnosed during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their mean age at presentation was 33.0+/-10.0 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The highest prevalence of UC was 17.9/100 000 hospital admissions in the Indians, followed by 11.2/100 000 hospital admissions in the Chinese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lowest prevalence was 3.7/100 000 hospital admissions in the Malays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of UC was significantly higher in the Indians and the Chinese when compared with the Malays with an OR of 4.89 (CI = 2.02-12.24; chi2 = 15.45, P&lt;0.001) and 3.06 (CI = 1.24-7.78; chi2 = 6.30; P = 0.012) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">colonic disease</z:e> was similar in the Malay and Indian patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, distal or left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> predominated in the Chinese with an OR of 8.17 (95%CI = 1.31-64.87; chi2 = 5.53, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Extraintestinal manifestations were uncommon (11.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: UC is an uncommon disease in Malaysia, but racial differences exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The Indians had the highest prevalence of UC with the Chinese demonstrating the least <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849867" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">extensive disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
