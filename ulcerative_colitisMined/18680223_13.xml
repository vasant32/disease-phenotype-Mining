<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the role of genetic factors in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), we investigated the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of NOD2/CARD15 (R702W, G908R and L1007finsC), and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) genes (D299G and T399I) in a selected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) population coming from Southern Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Allele and genotype frequencies of NOD2/CARD15 (R702W, G908R and L1007finsC) and TLR4 (D299G and T399I) SNPs were examined in 133 CD patients, in 45 UC patients, and in 103 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A genotype-phenotype correlation was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NOD2/CARD15 R702W mutation was significantly more frequent in CD (9.8%) than in controls (2.4%, P = 0.001) and in UC (2.3%, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found between UC patients and control group (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In CD and UC patients, no significant association with G908R variant was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>L1007finsC SNP showed an association with CD (9.8%) compared with controls (2.9%, P = 0.002) and UC patients (2.3%, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in CD patients, G908R and L1007finsC mutations were significantly associated with different phenotypes compared to CD <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No association of IBD with the TLR4 SNPs was found in either cohort (allele frequencies: D299G-controls 3.9%, CD 3.7%, UC 3.4%, P &gt; 0.05; T399I-controls 2.9%, CD 3.0%, UC 3.4%, P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings confirm that, in our IBD patients selected from Southern Italy, the NOD2/CARD15, but not TLR4 SNPs, are associated with increased risk of CD </plain></SENT>
