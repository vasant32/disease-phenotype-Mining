<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that polymer coating might retard jejunal absorption of 5-amino <z:chebi fb="4" ids="16914">salicylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>) and thus promote delivery to its colonic site of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty three patients with active (nine), or quiescent (14) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> were given either uncoated or coated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">Asacol</z:chebi>) 400 mg qds for one to three weeks, after which they ingested five 1.5 ml dialysis membrane sachets which were recovered from the stool in the next 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After one week of treatment the concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> in the faecal dialysate, urine, and fasting plasma in those receiving the coated and uncoated preparations were respectively: 25.4 +/- 5.1 compared with 1.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/l (p less than 0.001); 0.34 +/- 0.21 compared with 0.70 +/- 0.29 mmol/24h (NS) and 11.1 +/- 4.2 compared with 0.07 +/- 0.03 mumol/l (p less than 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Faecal excretion of the drug appeared to be greater in patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> than in those with quiescent disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus coating with pH dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25219">methacrylic acid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53310">copolymer</z:chebi> B is a very effective method of promoting delivery of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> to the colon, stool dialysate concentrations being 20 fold more than those in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased trough plasma concentrations in the polymer coating group probably reflect delayed intestinal absorption but no evidence of plasma accumulation after 21 days of therapy was found </plain></SENT>
