<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To examine the expression of metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) in the colonic mucosa of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry were used to study the expression of MMP-1 and TIMP-1 at both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels in patients with UC and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship between MMP-1 mRNA, TIMP-1 mRNA, MMP-1 mRNA/TIMP-1 mRNA ratio and the severity of clinical symptoms of the patients with UC were also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expression of MMP-1 mRNA and TIMP-1 mRNA in the ulcerated and inflamed colonic mucosa was significantly higher than that in the non-inflamed colonic mucosa (P &lt; 0.001), but there was no statistically significant difference in the non-inflamed colonic mucosa of UC patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of MMP-1 and TIMP-1 in ulcerated colonic mucosa of UC patients was increased by 80-fold and 2.2-fold, respectively when compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the inflamed colonic mucosa, the increase was 30-fold and 1.6-fold, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis showed that among the ulcerated, inflamed, and non-inflamed colonic mucosae of UC patients and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, the positive rate of MMP-1 expression was 87%, 87%, 40% and 35% respectively, and the positive rate of TIMP-1 expression was 89%, 89%, 80% and 75%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the expression of MMP-1 mRNA, TIMP-1 mRNA and the MMP-1 mRNA/ TIMP-1 mRNA ratio were correlated with the severity of clinical symptoms (P &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Excessive expression of MMP-1 in the diseased colonic mucosa causes excessive hydrolysis of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and ulceration in UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MMP-1 mRNA, TIMP-1 mRNA and MMP-1 mRNA/TIMP-1 mRNA ratio can be used as biomarkers to judge the severity of clinical symptoms in patients with UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Exogenous TIMP-1 or MMP-1 inhibitor therapy is a novel treatment for patients with UC </plain></SENT>
