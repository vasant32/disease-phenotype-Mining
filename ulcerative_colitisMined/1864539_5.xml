<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Measurements were assessed using a computer aided measuring system and a counting technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When untreated patients were compared with the control group there were significant decreases in the area and height of the surface epithelium, in the area of crypt epithelium, and in the ratios of goblet cells to epithelial cells and of surface epithelium to lamina propria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The vascular and lamina propria areas and the number of intraepithelial polymorphs were increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with 5 amino <z:chebi fb="4" ids="16914">salicylic acid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> resulted in similar morphological improvements: there was an increase in the area and height of the surface epithelium and the ratios of surface epithelium to lamina propria and of surface to crypt cell height </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ratio of goblet cells to epithelial cells also increased after treatment, while the numbers of polymorphs in the surface and crypt epithelium and lumen decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, computerised morphometry is valuable for the assessment of the treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and that in the doses used both treatments were of similar efficacy </plain></SENT>
