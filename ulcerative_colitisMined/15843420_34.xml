<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Recent data have suggested that specific haplotypic variants of the DLG5 gene on chromosome 10q23 may be associated with susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) in Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Haplotype D, notably characterised by the presence of a G--&gt;A substitution at nucleotide 113, was associated with susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) whereas an extended haplotype A conferred protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Association of DLG5 haplotypic variants with disease susceptibility, genotype-phenotype relationships, and epistasis with CARD15 was investigated in the Scottish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 374 CD, 305 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), and 294 healthy controls (HC) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotyping for the variants rs1248696 (113A, representing haplotype D) and the single nucleotide polymorphism tag rs2289311 (representing haplotype A) were typed using the Taqman system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On analysis of the DLG5 variant 113A, there were no associations with IBD when allelic frequency (11.4% IBD v 13.2% HC; p = 0.30) and carrier frequency (19.2% IBD v 24.6% HC; p = 0.069) were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No associations were observed between 113A variant allelic frequency (p = 0.37), carrier frequency (p = 0.057), and CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In fact, 113A heterozygosity rates were lower in CD (16%) and IBD (16.9%) than in HC (23%) (p = 0.029 and p = 0.033, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No associations between DLG5 and UC were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Haplotype A was not protective and there was no evidence of epistasis between DLG5 and CARD15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present data contrast strongly with previous data from Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DLG5 113A is not associated with disease susceptibility and haplotype A does not confer resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further work is required to evaluate the significance of DLG5 in other populations from geographically diverse regions </plain></SENT>
