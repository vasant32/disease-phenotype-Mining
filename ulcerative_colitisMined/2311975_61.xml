<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At 12 weekly intervals patients were asked, by means of standardised questionnaires, about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, compliance with maintenance medication, new drug treatment, dietary changes, episodes of non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151594" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bloody diarrhoea</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038443" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">life stresses</z:e>, and feelings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty five patients (38%) relapsed (median interval 17 weeks, range three to 46 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who relapsed had a higher previous relapse rate than non-relapsers (p less than 0.001) and a shorter time from previous relapse to trial entry (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other clinical characteristics were equally matched in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Between and within group comparisons revealed that upper respiratory tract symptoms, antibiotic ingestion, <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> intake, diarrhoeal episodes and stressful life events were no more common in the four weeks before relapse than before routine attendance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> ratings were also similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The timing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> relapse showed a clear seasonal pattern with 26 patients relapsing from August to January and only nine from January to July (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, a retrospective case note analysis revealed significant seasonality of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that seasonal factors may contribute to both <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and relapse of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
