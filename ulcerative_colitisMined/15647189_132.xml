<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The immune response against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> commensal microorganisms is believed to drive inflammatory processes associated with UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, modulation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> communities on the gut mucosa, through the use of probiotics and prebiotics, may be used to modify the disease state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A synbiotic was developed for use in UC patients combining a probiotic, Bifidobacterium longum, isolated from healthy rectal epithelium, and a prebiotic (Synergy 1), a preferential <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15443">inulin</z:chebi>-oligofructose growth substrate for the probiotic strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment was employed in a double blinded randomised controlled trial using 18 patients with active UC for a period of one month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical status was scored and rectal biopsies were collected before and after treatment, and transcription levels of epithelium related immune markers were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sigmoidoscopy scores (scale 0-6) were reduced in the test group (start 4.5 (1.4), end 3.1 (2.5)) compared with placebo (start 2.6 (2.1), end 3.2 (2.2)) (p=0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels for human beta defensins 2, 3, and 4, which are strongly upregulated in active UC, were significantly reduced in the test group after treatment (p=0.016, 0.038, and 0.008, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha and interleukin 1alpha, which are inflammatory cytokines that drive <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and induce defensin expression, were also significantly reduced after treatment (p=0.018 and 0.023, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Biopsies in the test group had reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and regeneration of epithelial tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Short term synbiotic treatment of active UC resulted in improvement of the full clinical appearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in patients receiving this therapy </plain></SENT>
