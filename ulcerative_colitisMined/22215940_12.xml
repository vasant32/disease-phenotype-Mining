<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the response to infliximab in pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD), as reflected in fecal calprotectin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-six pediatric patients with IBD [23 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), 13 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC); median age 14 years] were treated with infliximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fecal calprotectin was measured at baseline, and 2 and 6 wk after therapy, and compared to blood inflammatory markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Maintenance medication was unaltered until the third infusion but <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> were tapered off if the patient was doing well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At introduction of infliximab, median fecal calprotectin level was 1150 μg/g (range 54-6032 μg/g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By week 2, the fecal calprotectin level had declined to a median 261 μg/g (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 37% of the patients, fecal calprotectin was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (&lt; 100 μg/g) at 2 wk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By week 6, there was no additional improvement in the fecal calprotectin level (median 345 μg/g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 22% of the patients, fecal calprotectin levels increased by week 6 to pretreatment levels or above, suggesting no response (or a loss of early response) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, in CD, the proportion of non-responsive patients by week 6 seemed lower, because only 9% showed no improvement in their fecal calprotectin level when compared to the respective figure of 46% of the UC patients (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: When treated with infliximab, fecal calprotectin levels reflecting <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> normalized rapidly in one third of pediatric patients suggesting complete mucosal healing </plain></SENT>
