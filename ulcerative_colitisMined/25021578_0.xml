<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One study has reported that half of patients with IBD report improvements in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0009247'>bloating</z:mp>, flatulence and diarrhoea after following a low FODMAP diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Up to 70% of patients reported adherence to the diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the effectiveness of low FODMAP diet advice in patients with IBD in the UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with inactive IBD and FBD (as diagnosed by their gastroenterologist), who had been referred to the dietitian and advised on a low FODMAP diet were included in this evaluation of clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Symptoms were measured pre and post (at least 6 weeks) low FODMAP dietary advice as part of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> clinical practice using the global symptom question (GSQ)'Do you currently have satisfactory relief of your gut symptoms?' and the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stool frequency was considered '<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>' if between 2-3 times per week to 2-3 times per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Types 3-5 on the Bristol stool form scale were considered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stool consistency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were made using the McNemar test for categorical data and a paired t-test for continuous data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data from 35 patients with IBD (17 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, 17 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, one IBD unclassified, 63% female, mean age 39y) were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase in the number of patients reporting positively to the GSQ (n[%] pre: 8 [23] versus post: 29 [83]; p &lt; 0.001) and the GSRS composite score (mean [SD] pre: 1.25 [0.48] versus post: 0.77 [0.45]; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fewer patients reported symptoms including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0009247'>bloating</z:mp>, flatulence and urgency, increased stool frequency, and type 6 or 7 Bristol stool form post dietary advice compared with pre dietary advice (Table). gutjnl;63/Suppl_1/A164-a/T1T1T1 Abstract PWE-092 Table 1 Symptom Pre n (%) Post n (%) p Symptom Pre n (%) Post n (%) p <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>Abdominal pain</z:hpo> 13 (37) 6 (17) 0.039 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>Nausea</z:hpo> 3 (9) 0 (0) 0.250 Abdominal <z:mp ids='MP_0009247'>bloating</z:mp> 25 (71) 9 (26) &lt;0.001 Heartburn 4 (11) 3 (9) 1.000 Flatulence 24 (69) 7 (20) &lt;0.001 Acid regurgitation 4 (11) 1 (3) 0.250 Belching 6 (17) 3 (9) 0.508 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001254'>Lethargy</z:hpo> 27 (77) 14 (40) 0.002 Borborygmi 17 (49) 6 (17) 0.003 Stool frequency &gt;3 times/day 17 (49) 8 (23) 0.012 Faecal urgency 22 (63) 9 (26) 0.002 Type 6 or 7 Bristol stool form 12 (34) 9 (26) 0.549 Incomplete evacuation 9 (26) 8 (23) 1.000 CONCLUSION: The low FODMAP diet appears to be an effective treatment option for patients with IBD and FGD particularly for those with symptoms of abdominal <z:mp ids='MP_0009247'>bloating</z:mp>, flatulence, faecal urgency and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001254'>lethargy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
