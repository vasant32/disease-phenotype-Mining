<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Granulomata were shown not to affect the maximum diameter of the lymph nodes nor to be more frequent in large nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The enlargement of lymph nodes appeared to be due to simple, non-specific, reactive changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Granulomatous lymph nodes were found in 38% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> our cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and in 63% of those cases with granulomata in the bowel wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One case was found with granulomata in the lymph nodes which were not seen in the bowel wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mesenteric lymph nodes of 22 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> were shown to be not significantly different in size from those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the lymph nodes on the histological section was shown to underestimate the diameter of nodes in the fresh state by a factor of 1.5 </plain></SENT>
