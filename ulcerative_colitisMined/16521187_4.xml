<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively studied <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0443257" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microproteinuria</z:e> in 86 consecutive patients with IBD, 61 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and 25 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), before as well as 2 and 6 months after their inclusion in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-six patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> for a period of 28.8 months (range 1-168 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>Microalbuminuria</z:mp> (mALB) and urine levels of the renal tubular proteins beta2-microglobulin (beta2mGLB) and beta-N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-D-glucosamidase (beta-NAG) as well as the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance were determined in a 12-h overnight urine collection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) serum levels were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 277 measurements (194 in UC patients and 83 in CD patients) were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of abnormal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0443257" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microproteinuria</z:e> in UC and CD patients was 12.9% and 6.0% for mALB, 22.7% and 27.7% for beta2mGLB, and 11.3% and 8.4% for beta-NAG, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>mALB was not associated with IBD activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Beta2mGLB and beta-NAG urine levels were correlated to UC activity (UCAI: P&lt;0.01; UCEI: P&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>mALB in UC patients and beta-NAG urine levels in CD patients were related to TNF-alpha serum levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An association was noticed between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0443257" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microproteinuria</z:e> and smoking habit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> was not correlated to the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0443257" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microproteinuria</z:e> or to the changes of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0443257" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Microproteinuria</z:e> is mainly associated with UC and its activity but not affected by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
