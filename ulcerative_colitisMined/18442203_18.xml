<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine if infliximab can prevent or delay surgery in refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: UC patients who failed to have their disease controlled with conventional therapies and were to undergo colectomy if infliximab failed to induce a clinical improvement were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were primarily treated with a single 5 mg/kg infliximab dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>Colitis</z:hpo> Activity Index (CAI) was used to determine response and remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data of 8 wk response and colectomy rates at 6 mo and 12 mo were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen patients were included, 7 with UC unresponsive or intolerant to i.v. <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi>, and 8 with active disease despite oral steroids (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one with therapeutic dosage and duration of immunomodulation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi>-resistant/intolerant patients had been on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6-MP</z:chebi> &lt; 8 wk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 8 wk, infliximab induced a response in 86.7% (13/15) with 40% in remission (6/15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Within 6 mo of treatment 26.7% (4/15) had undergone colectomy and surgery was avoided in 46.6% (7/15) at 12 mo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The colectomy rate at 12 mo in those on immunomodulatory therapy &lt; 8 wk at time of infliximab was 12.5% (1/8) compared with 100% (7/7) in patients who were on long-term maintenance immunomodulators (P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Infliximab prevented colectomy due to active disease in immunomodulatory-naive, refractory UC patients comparable to the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In patients, however, on effective dosage and duration of immunomodulation at time of infliximab therapy colectomy was not avoided </plain></SENT>
