<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the therapeutic equivalence and safety of once daily (OD) versus three times daily (TID) dosing of a total daily dose of 3 g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">Salofalk</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi>) granules in patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, multicentre, international, phase III non-inferiority study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: 54 centres in 13 countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 380 patients with confirmed diagnosis of established or first attack of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (clinical activity index (CAI)&gt;4 and endoscopic index &gt; or =4 at baseline) were randomised and treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: 8-week treatment with either 3 g OD or 1 g TID <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> granules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical remission (CAI&lt; or =4) at study end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 380 patients were evaluable for efficacy and safety by intention-to-treat (ITT); 345 for per protocol (PP) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the ITT population, 79.1% in the OD group (n = 191) and 75.7% in the TID group (n = 189) achieved clinical remission (p&lt;0.0001 for non-inferiority) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significantly more patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033252" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">proctosigmoiditis</z:e> achieved clinical remission in the OD group (86%; n = 97) versus the TID group (73%; n = 100; p = 0.0298) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>About 70% of patients in both treatment groups achieved endoscopic remission, and 35% in the OD group and 41% in the TID group achieved histological remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>About 80% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients preferred OD dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Similar numbers of adverse events occurred in 55 patients (28.8%) in the OD group and in 61 patients (32.3%) in the TID group, indicating that the two dosing regimens were equally safe and well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: OD 3 g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> granules are as effective and safe as a TID 1 g schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>With respect to the best possible adherence of patients to the treatment, OD dosing of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> should be the preferred application mode in active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
