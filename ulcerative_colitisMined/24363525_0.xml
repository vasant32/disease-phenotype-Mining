<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum PCT levels, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and the white blood cell count were analyzed in 18 patients with UC and 11 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum PCT levels were analyzed by an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Severity assessments were based on Truelove and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271977" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Witts</z:e>' severity index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Correlation of serum PCT and CRP levels with UC activity was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we assessed serum PCT and CRP levels in patients with a Mayo endoscopic subscore </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum PCT levels in severe UC patients (n = 7) (0.096 ± 0.034 ng/mL) were significantly higher than in mild-to-moderate UC patients (n = 11) (0.033 ± 0.012 ng/mL) and healthy volunteers (n = 11) (0.035 ± 0.005 ng/mL) (P = 0.0005 and P &lt; 0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was no difference in serum PCT levels between mild-to-moderate UC patients and healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, patients with a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 3 points displayed significantly increased levels of serum PCT (0.075 ± 0.043 ng/mL) compared with patients with a subscore of 2 points (0.03 ± 0.011 ng/mL) (P = 0.0302) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, CRP levels in patients with severe UC or a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 3 points were not significantly higher than in patients with mild-to-moderate UC or a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 3 points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Serum PCT levels were significantly correlated with UC activity </plain></SENT>
