<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, our aim was to investigate whether the intraperitoneal administration of a nonpeptide neurokinin-1 (NK-1) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, CP-96345, which antagonizes the binding of SP to its NK-1 receptor, results in the attenuation of colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> induced in rats by 5% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32149">sodium sulfate</z:chebi> (DSS) in drinking water for 10 days compared with an inactive enantiomer, CP-96344 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was assessed daily for 10 days, after which colonic tissue damage was scored and myeloperoxidase activity and colon and urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33023">8-isoprostanes</z:chebi> were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals receiving DSS exhibited marked physical signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> by day 5 compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> administration of the NK-1 antagonist significantly reduced the disease activity index, mucosal myeloperoxidase activity, colonic tissue damage score, and mucosal and urinary levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33023">8-isoprostanes</z:chebi> compared with inactive enantiomer- or vehicle-injected (saline) animals receiving DSS alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the administration of an NK-1 antagonist can attenuate colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and suggest a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
