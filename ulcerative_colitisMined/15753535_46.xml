<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Expression of inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) is greatly upregulated in the colonic mucosa of patients with collagenous and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) is a major inducer of iNOS gene expression, we compared activation and transcriptional activity of NFkappaB in colonic mucosal biopsies from these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Eight patients with collagenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, six with relapsing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and eight with uninflamed bowel were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: NFkappaB DNA binding activity was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and inhibitor of NFkappaB (IkappaB) kinase (IKK) activity by immunocomplex kinase assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vivo recruitment of NFkappaB to the iNOS promoter was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and transcriptional activity by NFkappaB gene expression profiling arrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cells showing NFkappaB activation were identified by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In collagenous and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, as opposed to uninflamed bowel, IKKbeta activity and strong NFkappaB DNA binding gave rise to activation of identical NFkappaB subunits and recruitment of transcriptionally active p65 to the iNOS promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In collagenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, activated NFkappaB was observed only in epithelial cells while up to 10% of lamina propria macrophages showed activation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In collagenous and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, colonic mucosal NFkappaB is activated and recruited to the iNOS promoter in vivo via an IKKbeta mediated pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As collagenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> is not associated with tissue injury, these data challenge the prevailing view that activation of NFkappaB per se mediates tissue injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that downstream inflammatory reactions leading to tissue damage originate in lamina propria immune cells, as increased NFkappaB activity in collagenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> was localised solely in epithelial cells, but present also in macrophages in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
