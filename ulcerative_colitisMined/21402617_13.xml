<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) associated with primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> (PSC) is usually clinically mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to assess whether there is an association between severity of PSC and activity of UC, comparing the course of UC in patients with PSC not needing liver transplantation (LT) and those eventually transplanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1990 and 2009, 96 consecutive patients with PSC/UC were seen in the authors' institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were evaluated from a database regarding UC activity (median follow-up 144 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was censored at time of LT or last clinical review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with PSC/UC were divided into two groups: 46 did not need LT (no-LT) and 50 were transplanted (LT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences concerning duration of UC or PSC and extent of UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The LT group had significantly (p=0.002) more clinically quiescent UC compared with the no-LT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The LT group had fewer UC flare-ups (p=0.04) and required fewer steroid courses (p=0.025) with shorter duration (p=0.022) and less use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> (p=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was an increased need for surgery in the no-LT group (p=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were more frequent in the no-LT group (p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The no-LT group had increased <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the colonic mucosa at histology (p=0.011), but without visual difference at colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinically progressive PSC requiring LT is associated with a milder course of UC (reduced disease activity and less use of steroids, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> and surgery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This is paralleled by less histological activity and reduced incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
