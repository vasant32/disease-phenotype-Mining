<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Stem cells have been identified in two locations in small intestinal crypts; those intercalated between Paneth cells and another population (which retains DNA label) are located above the Paneth cell zone, at cell position 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of disadvantages associated with the use of DNA label, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi>-induced transient transgenic expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> 2B (H2B)-green fluorescent protein (GFP) was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>H2B-GFP-retaining putative stem cells were consistently seen, with a peak at cell position 4, over chase periods of up to 112 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a 28-day chase, a subpopulation of the H2B-GFP-retaining cells was cycling, but the slow cycling status of the majority was illustrated by lack of expression of pHistone H3 and Ki67 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although some H2B-GFP-retaining cells were sensitive to low-dose radiation, the majority was resistant to low- and high-dose radiation-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and a proportion of the surviving cells proliferated during subsequent epithelial regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Long-term retention of H2B-GFP in a subpopulation of small intestinal Paneth cells was also seen, implying that they are long lived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the small intestine, H2B-GFP-retaining epithelial cells were not seen in the colon from 28-day chase onward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This implies important differences in stem cell function between these two regions of the gastrointestinal tract, which may have implications for region-specific susceptibility to diseases (such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>), in which epithelial stem cells and their progeny are involved </plain></SENT>
