<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study therefore, assesses the incidence of UC and CD in a semirural area of north west Greece during the 10 year period 1982-1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By the 31 December 1991, 61 patients had met standard diagnostic criteria for UC (annual incidence 4.0/10(5), 95% confidence intervals 3.0 to 5.0/10(5)) and only five patients met the diagnostic criteria for CD (annual incidence 0.3/10(5), 95% confidence intervals 0.1 to 0.8/10(5)) in this area of 157,214 inhabitants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>UC incidence was lowest in the first three years at 1.8/10(5) per annum and subsequently increased to 4.8 and 5.1/10(5) per annum for the successive four and three year periods respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>UC incidence was slightly higher in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A third of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of UC had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0868908" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pancolitis</z:e> while a quarter had only <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More than one half were categorised as having moderate or severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three quarters of the patients resided in urban areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of CD was a twelfth of the UC incidence, which is in considerable contrast with most Western countries where the incidence of CD is usually no less than a third that for UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rarity of CD points to the absence of aetiological environmental factors specific for CD </plain></SENT>
