<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The levels were then related to category, extent, duration, and severity of disease, as well as to the ages and surgical status of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The distribution of CEA levels and their mean values were significantly raised over the levels in 33 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects, and were similar among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> compared with those with granulomatous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Positive values were defined as those in excess of 2.5 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Positive assays occurred in 42% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients, in 38% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients, and in 40% of the total group with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects, only 3% were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> patients, positive CEA assays occurred more frequently with more severe disease, more extensive anatomical involvement, younger ages, and shorter duration of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those patients who had undergone total colectomy showed levels of circulating CEA and frequency of CEA positivity similar to those of an age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group </plain></SENT>
