<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the clinical efficacy of leukocytapheresis (LCAP) in patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), and to elucidate the mechanisms by determining the changes in the cytokine levels in the peripheral blood and of the functions of the peripheral blood leukocytes in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects were 19 patients with active UC, with a mean clinical activity index (CAI) of 9.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The LCAP was conducted using Cellsorba E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each session of LCAP, 2-3 L of blood at the flow rate of 30-50 mL/min was processed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The treatment was carried out in approximately 1-h sessions, once a week, for 5-10 wk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood samples for determination of the cytokine levels were collected from the inflow side of the column (site of dehematization; at the start of LCAP) and outflow side of the column (at the end of LCAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood samples for the determination of reactive-oxygen-producing cells were collected from the peripheral blood before and after LCAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LCAP resulted in clinical improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 19 patients of UC recruited for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Remission (CAI: &lt; or = 4) was noted in 15 (79%) of the 19 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The blood level of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 was found to be decreased following treatment by LCAP, and the level of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 at the outflow side of the LCAP column was found to be significantly elevated as compared to that at the inflow side of the column </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The reactive-oxygen-producing granulocytes in the peripheral blood of UC patients was increased as compared to that in healthy persons and the increase was found to be decreased following treatment by LCAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: LCAP exerted a high therapeutic efficacy in patients with active UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that LCAP is associated with enhanced production of the inhibitory cytokine IL-10 to indirectly inhibit the functions of the inflammatory leukocytes, and that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is also considerably attenuated by the direct removal of reactive-oxygen-producing neutrophils from the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
