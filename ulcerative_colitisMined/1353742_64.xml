<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effect of fish oil on the course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> was investigated in a randomised blinded controlled study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighty seven patients received supplements of 20 ml HiEPA fish oil as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (4.5 g of eicosapentaenoic acid) or olive oil placebo daily for one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The oils were given in addition to standard drug therapy and trial entry was stratified for disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fish oil significantly increased the eicosapentaenoic acid content of rectal mucosa to 3.2% of total fatty acids at six months, compared with 0.63% for patients on olive oil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was associated with increased synthesis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotriene</z:chebi> B5, and 53% suppression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">leukotriene B4</z:chebi> synthesis by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">ionophore</z:chebi>--stimulated neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">Leukotriene B4</z:chebi> suppression persisted for at least two months after treatment was stopped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with fish oil resulted in measurable, but only limited clinical benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For patients entering the trial in relapse (n = 53), there was a significant reduction in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> requirement after one and two months treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a trend towards achieving remission (off <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>) faster in the patients on fish oil, although differences were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For patients in remission at trial entry or during the trial (n = 69), there was no significant difference in the rate of relapse by log rank analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that fish oil supplementation produces a modest <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> sparing effect in active disease, but there is no benefit in maintenance therapy </plain></SENT>
