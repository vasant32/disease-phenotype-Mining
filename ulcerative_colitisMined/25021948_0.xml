<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> (IBD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's Disease</z:hpo> (CD) occur when failures of immune regulation result in an accumulation of immune effector cells that damage the intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A detailed understanding of these processes has heretofore been hampered by difficulties in obtaining phenotypic and functional analyses of the multitude of closely-related immune cells present in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and in the diseased intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show data from our recently-developed 12-parameter flow cytometric analyses of leukocytes from blood and intestinal biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We anticipate that this approach will enable us to identify immune mechanisms causing or controlling IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After written informed consent was obtained, endoscopic biopsies from the colon and/or terminal ileum were obtained from patients with UC, CD, or from unaffected individuals attending for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> surveillance colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were obtained from UC or CD patients attending IBD clinics, or from healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Live single cell suspensions were prepared, and were prepared for flow cytometric analysis, focusing on dendritic cell and T cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data were analysed using FlowJo software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Differences were analysed by Mann-Whitney or ANOVA, with post tests to assess significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We have developed novel and reproducible methods for purification of live cells from fresh colonic and ileal biopsies, and for enumerating of T cell and antigen presenting cell populations using 10-colour flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We have compared data from IBD patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Initial analyses of intestinal dendritic cell populations (CD45(+) CD14(-) CD64(-) CD11c(+) MHC class II(+)) have identified three distinct subsets based on CD103 and SIRPα expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our preliminary data indicate that dendritic cells are differently distributed along the intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Analyses of intestinal T cells (CD45(+) CD3(+) CD4(+), CD25(+) (/-) CD45RA(+/-)) have revealed the proportions of naïve, activated, memory, and regulatory T cells expressing the chemokine receptors CCR6, CCR9, CXCR3 and CCR10 in each population. gutjnl;63/Suppl_1/A72-b/F1F1F1 Abstract PTU-077 Figure 1 Gating strategy to identify three subsets of dendritic cells in a colonic biopsies from an individual unaffected by IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our novel multi-parameter analyses of live cells prepared from fresh colonic and ileal biopsies enable precise examination of the disease-inducing and effector populations that drive UC and CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We are using the methods described here to dissect the immunological mechanisms driving <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We anticipate that our on-going comparisons of each of these immune cell populations in blood and intestinal biopsies from unaffected individuals, CD, and UC patients will reveal important details about pathogenic mechanisms controlling <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
