<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Steroid-based intensive medical therapy for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> is successful in 60-70% of such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with complications or those refractory to medical therapy require emergency colectomy for salvage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the impact of timing of surgical intervention and surgical outcomes of such patients undergoing emergency surgery in India where the diagnosis is often delayed or missed in patients who are poor, malnourished and non-compliant to medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing emergency surgery for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> or its complication in the Department of GI surgery AIIMS, New Delhi, India, between January 1985 and December 2003 were retrieved and data pertaining to demographic features, duration of intensive medical therapy, presence of complications, time from admission to emergency surgery, surgical procedure, in-hospital morbidity and mortality and follow up status extracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 72 patients underwent emergency surgery (Subtotal colectomy: 60; ileostomy alone under local anaesthesia: 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Poor nutritional status was seen in 61% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients (29%) underwent emergency surgery for complications of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> such as colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> (spontaneous 6, iatrogenic 4), massive lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage (5), toxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002251'>megacolon</z:hpo> (4) and large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021843" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">bowel obstruction</z:e> (2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients (n = 51) underwent emergency surgery following failed intensive therapy; 17 underwent surgery &lt; or = 5 days (Group I) and 34 were operated &gt; 5 days (Group II) after initiation of intensive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this group <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the post-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (n = 8) occurred in those who were operated after 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The difference in mortality in these two groups (i.e. surgical intervention &lt; or = or &gt; 5 days) was statistically significant {0/17 (Group I) vs 8/34 (Group II); p = 0.03} </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, 12 patients died (in-hospital mortality: 16.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mortality was higher (10/43; 23.3%) in our early experience (i.e. 1985-1995) when compared to our subsequent experience (2/29; 6.9%) (1996-2003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A total of 48 patients (including 3 awaiting a restorative procedure) are alive on follow up (66.7%; 3 patients lost to follow up) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A restorative procedure could be successfully completed in 81% of the survivors of the emergency procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: To optimize the outcome, a combined team of physicians and surgeons should be involved in the management of patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> with focus on nutritional support, correction of metabolic derangements, close clinical monitoring and timely assessment for the need for emergency surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This retrospective analysis shows that improved results can be achieved with experience and by following a policy of early surgical intervention within 5 days, especially in patients who have failed intensive medical therapy </plain></SENT>
