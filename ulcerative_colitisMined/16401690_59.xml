<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The intestinal microbiota plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e>, a major complication after ileal pouch anal anastomosis in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, controlled trials have demonstrated that probiotics are effective in maintenance of remission in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism by which therapy with probiotics works remains elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study explores the role of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> and fungal flora in a controlled trial for maintenance of remission in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> patients with the probiotic VSL#3 compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The mucosa associated pouch microbiota was investigated before and after therapy with VSL#3 by analysis of endoscopic biopsies using ribosomal DNA/<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> based community fingerprint analysis, clone libraries, real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and fluorescence in situ hybridisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were recruited from a placebo controlled remission maintenance trial with VSL#3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> while treated with placebo had low <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> and high fungal diversity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>Bacterial</z:mp> diversity was increased and fungal diversity was reduced in patients in remission maintained with VSL#3 (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Real time PCR experiments demonstrated that VSL#3 increased the total number of <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> cells (p = 0.002) and modified the spectrum of bacteria towards anaerobic species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taxa specific clone libraries for Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria showed that the richness and spectrum of these bacteria were altered under probiotic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Probiotic therapy with VSL#3 increases the total number of intestinal <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> cells as well as the richness and diversity of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> microbiota, especially the anaerobic flora </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The diversity of the fungal flora is repressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Restoration of the integrity of a "protective" intestinal mucosa related microbiota could therefore be a potential mechanism of probiotic bacteria in inflammatory barrier diseases of the lower gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
