<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) are multifactorial diseases with a significant genetic background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Apart from CARD15/NOD2 gene, evidence is accumulating that molecules related to the innate immune response such as CD14 or Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), are involved in their pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In further exploring the genetic background of these diseases, we investigated the variations in the CARD15/NOD2 gene (Arg702Trp, Gly908Arg and Leu1007fsinsC), and polymorphisms in the TLR4 gene (Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile) as well as in the promoter of the CD14 gene (T/C at position -159) in Greek patients with CD and UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DNA was obtained from 120 patients with CD, 85 with UC and 100 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotyping was performed by allele specific PCR or by PCR-RFLP analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 299Gly allele frequency of the TLR4 gene and the T allele and TT genotype frequencies of the CD14 promoter were significantly higher in CD patients only compared to healthy individuals (P = 0.026&lt;0.05; P = 0.0048&lt;0.01 and P = 0.047&lt;0.05 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concerning the NOD2/CARD15 mutations the overall presence in CD patients was significantly higher than that in UC patients or in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, 51.67% of the CD patients were carriers of a TLR4 and/or CD14 polymorphic allele and at least one variant of the NOD2/CARD15, compared to 27% of the UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It should be pointed out that both frequencies significantly increased as compared with the 10% frequency of multiple carriers found in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A possible interaction of the NOD2/CARD15 with TLR4 and especially CD14, increased the risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that co-existence of a mutation in either the TLR4 or CD14 gene, and in NOD2/CARD15 is associated with an increased susceptibility to developing CD compared to UC, and to developing either CD or UC compared to healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
