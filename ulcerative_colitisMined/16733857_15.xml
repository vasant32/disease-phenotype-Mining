<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) clinical activity index (CAI) and circulating levels of IL-1ra, IL-10, IL-6 and IL-18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood levels of IL-1ra, IL-10, IL-6 and IL-18 were measured in 31 patients with active UC, the mean CAI was 11.1, ranging from 5-25; and 12 healthy individuals as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were given granulocyte and monocyte adsorptive apheresis (GMA) with Adacolumn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Leucocytes which bear the FcgammaR and complement receptors were adsorbed to the column leucocytapheresis carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each patient could receive up to 11 GMA sessions over 8 wk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found strong correlations between CAI and IL-10 (r = 0.827, P &lt; 0.001), IL-6 (r = 0.785, P &lt; 0.001) and IL-18 (r = 0.791, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IL-1ra was not correlated with CAI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following GMA therapy, 24 of the 31 patients achieved remission and the levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 cytokines fell to the levels in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, blood levels of IL-1ra and IL-10 increased at the column outflow and inflow at 60 min suggesting release from leucocytes that adhered to the carriers </plain></SENT>
