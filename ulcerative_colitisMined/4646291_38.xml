<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results show that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon absorbs both <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> and water and secretes <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> there is a reversal of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> and water flux and <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> secretion is increased.A measure of the simultaneous bidirectional flux rates under conditions of zero potential has allowed us to use the Ussing equation to analyse some of the factors involved in <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> transport across the healthy and diseased mucosa </plain></SENT>
