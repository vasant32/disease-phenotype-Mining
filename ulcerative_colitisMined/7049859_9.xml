<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The total number of leucocytes mobilised to the chambers after 12 hours did not differ from those in 21 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 24 and 48 hours reduced number of leucocytes were mobilised by patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, the leucocyte migration rates were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> initially but were reduced after 18 hours Mobilisation in vivo was positively correlated to the blood neutrophil count (Rho:0.5549 po less than 0.02) but unrelated to clinical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood leucocytes showed reduced random migration in vitro as well as chemotactic response to casein (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum independent and dependent phagocytosis did not differ from healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9505">Nitro blue tetrazolium</z:chebi> reduction by resting leucocytes was increased (p less than 0.01) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest altered in vivo mobilisation and in vitro migration of leucocytes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> with increased spontaneous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9505">nitro blue tetrazolium</z:chebi> reduction reflecting increased generation of potentially tissue damaging agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The findings probably reflect changes secondary to the disease but which may be important in maintaining the inflammatory process </plain></SENT>
