<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients evaluated for an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> flare of IBD by a gastroenterologist at the Dallas VA Medical Center were invited to participate, as were a control group of patients with IBD in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were systematically queried about <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug</z:chebi> use, antibiotic use, stressful life events, cigarette smoking, medication adherence, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, and travel in the preceding 3 mo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Disease activity scores were calculated for each patient at the time of enrollment and each patient's chart was reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 134 patients with IBD (63 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 70 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and 1 with indeterminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>) were enrolled; 66 patients had flares of their IBD and 68 were controls with IBD in remission (for Crohn's patients, average <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> activity index was 350 for flares vs 69 in the controls; for UC patients, Mayo score was 7.6 for flares vs 1 for controls in those with full Mayo available and 5.4p for flares vs 0.1p for controls in those with partial Mayo score) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only medication non-adherence was significantly more frequent in the flare group than in the control group (48.5% vs 29.4%, P = 0.03) and remained significant on multivariate analysis (OR = 2.86, 95%CI: 1.33-6.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On multivariate regression analysis, immunomodulator use was found to be associated with significantly lower rates of flare (OR = 0.40, 95%CI: 0.19-0.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In a study of potential triggers for IBD flares, medication non-adherence was significantly associated with flares </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings are incentive to improve medication adherence </plain></SENT>
