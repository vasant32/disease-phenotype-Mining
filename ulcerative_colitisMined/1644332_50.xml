<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>T cell subset analysis and differential white blood cell counts were also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, 14 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, and 15 age matched healthy volunteers were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed in T cell subsets and OKT4/OKT8 ratios in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interleukin 1 beta production was significantly increased in active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, compared with values in controls, but returned to control levels in the inactive stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, in active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, there were significant correlations between the interleukin 1 beta production and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> activity index or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> activity index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interleukin 2 production was also significantly increased in the active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and significantly correlated to the activity index, but there was no change in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gamma interferon production in patients was the same as that in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that the interleukin 1 beta and 2 values in peripheral mononuclear leukocytes of active untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> are indicators of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, or both </plain></SENT>
