<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These findings were compared with the immunoglobulin containing cell number in colonic biopsies from 10 control patients with no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In biopsies from the 20 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> a marked increase in area of the lamina propria per millimetre mucosa length was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> a marked increase in number of IgG containing cells was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> the increase in IgG containing cell number is dependent on the degree of activity of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In quiescent of active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> of the colon we found a significant increase of the IgM containing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of IgM containing cells per millimetre mucosa length will differentiate the pathology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
