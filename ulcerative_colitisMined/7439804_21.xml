<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004610" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bacteraemia</z:e> occurred in either portal or systemic blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Systemic endotoxaemia developed in three patients during surgery but occurred before bowel mobilisation only in the one patient whose <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> was complicated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272404" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyposplenism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mesenteric endotoxaemia occurred in only three patients before bowel mobilisation, but was detected during surgery in two of the three patients who developed systemic endotoxaemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, contrary to earlier reports, portal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004610" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bacteraemia</z:e> must be infrequent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Systemic endotoxaemia does, however, occur in a significant proportion of cases during colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although in the patients studied this led to no clinical problems, it is likely to have been the precipitating factor for the syndrome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>) that we have previously observed after colectomy in some of our patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272404" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyposplenism</z:e> secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
