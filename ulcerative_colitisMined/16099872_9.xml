<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">Lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi>-induced CXC-chemokine (LIX) was recently identified as the murine homolog of ENA-78 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that, similar to ENA-78, inflammatory cytokine stimulation of a murine colonic epithelial cell line, MODE-K, results in increased LIX expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the expression pattern of ENA-78 in IBD, LIX expression is significantly increased in mice with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> induced by the ingestion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32149">sodium sulfate</z:chebi> (DSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treating mice with antisense oligonucleotides to LIX via rectal enema delivery before DSS treatment results in colonic enterocyte uptake and a significant reduction in neutrophil infiltration and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that LIX plays an integral role in the pathogenesis of DSS-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, enterocyte-derived CXC chemokines may play a key role in regulating neutrophil recruitment and intestinal injury in IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The intracolonic administration of ENA-78 antisense oligonucleotides may be effective in treating distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in humans </plain></SENT>
