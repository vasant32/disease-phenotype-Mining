<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and the role of mononuclear cells in this production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Colonic biopsies from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were cultured with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3207">budesonide</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> in the presence of proinflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human mixed mononuclear cells (<z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMCs</z:chebi>) were cocultured with HT-29 cells stimulated with IFN-gamma and LPS in the presence or absence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">Nitrite</z:chebi> production was measured in supernatants by a modification of the Griess reaction, and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was studied in colonic tissue by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both steroids significantly suppressed the <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> production and iNOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in inflamed colonic biopsies from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients and in cytokine-stimulated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic biopsies but not in cytokine-stimulated HT-29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">Nitrite</z:chebi> production by HT-29 cells was significantly increased (P &lt; 0.01) in cocultures with <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMCs</z:chebi> stimulated with IFN-gamma and LPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of either <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3207">budesonide</z:chebi> significantly (P &lt; 0.01) suppressed <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> production from cocultures of HT-29 cells and <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMCs</z:chebi> but not from cultures of HT-29 cells stimulated with conditioned media from activated <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMCs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, stimulation of HT-29 with conditioned media from <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMCs</z:chebi> pretreated with steroids before stimulation with LPS and IFN-gamma induced a significantly (P &lt; 0.01) lower <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> on the NO production in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> might be via the inhibition of <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi>-produced mediators responsible for NO production by colonic epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
