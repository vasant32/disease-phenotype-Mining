<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although paediatric-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> IBD is becoming more common, few medications have a registered paediatric indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are multiple hurdles to performing clinical trials in children, emphasising the importance of choosing an appropriate outcome measure, which can facilitate enrolment, and thereby also drug approval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this consensus statement is to highlight paediatric specific issues and key factors critical for the optimal conduct of paediatric IBD trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The Paediatric European Crohn's and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>Colitis</z:hpo> Organisation (ECCO) committee has established an international expert panel to determine the best outcome measures in paediatric IBD, following a literature search and a modified Delphi process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> recommendations were endorsed by at least 80% agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recognising the importance of mucosal healing (MH), the panel defined steroid-free MH as primary outcome measure for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> drugs of new category with one or two postintervention endoscopies per trial (at 8-12 weeks and/or 54 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since endoscopic evaluation is a barrier for recruitment in children, trials with medications already shown to induce MH in children or adults, could use paediatric-specific disease activity scores as primary outcome, including a modified Paediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's Disease</z:hpo> Activity Index in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and the Paediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative Colitis</z:hpo> Activity Index in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes should include safety issues, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> enterography-based damage and inflammatory scores (in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>), faecal calprotectin, quality of life scales, and a patient-reported outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is crucial to perform paediatric trials early in the development of new drugs in order to reduce off-label use of IBD medication in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The thoughtful choice of feasible and standardised outcome measures can help move us towards this goal </plain></SENT>
