<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Other organs, such as the eyes, skin and articulations, are often affected and IBD may be accompanied by other diseases of autoimmune origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is no single etiological factor responsible for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent advances in genetics and in the molecular mechanisms of the proteins coded by these genes have given rise to a new vision in understanding these complex diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Activation of specific genes that affect antigen presentation and the handling of cells by innate immunity may lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> with the consequent activation of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and multiple cytokines involved in the regulation of acquired immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this review IBD is described as a constellation of diseases that can best be classified as barrier diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This vision, developed by Kiel in Germany, includes the idea that changes in our environment due to the westernization of civilization have not been met with adaptation of the innate immune system, and this has given rise to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These diseases affect 1-5 of 1000 individuals and represent a major burden on the national health systems of many countries on different continents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On a world scale, a major challenge is to generate interventions to prevent the development of these diseases in Asia, Latin America and Africa </plain></SENT>
