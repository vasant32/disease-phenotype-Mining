<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>Abdominal pain</z:hpo> is a serious cause of morbidity in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To better understand the mechanisms and potentially identify new targets for treatment, the effects of inflammatory supernatant from colonic biopsies of patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) on mouse colonic nociceptive dorsal root ganglia neurons were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Acutely dissociated dorsal root ganglia neurons innervating the mouse colon were incubated in supernatants obtained from colonic biopsies from patients with UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were obtained to examine the effects on neuronal excitability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The role of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNFalpha) was studied using TNFalpha receptor (TNFR) knockout mice and comparing supernatant and TNFalpha actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: UC supernatants significantly decreased the rheobase and increased action potential discharge, indicating increased neuronal excitability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Human biopsies exhibited high levels of TNFalpha, and mouse colonic neurons only exhibited TNFR1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Incubation with TNFalpha recapitulated the supernatant effects on neuronal excitability, and supernatant and TNFalpha actions were almost completely blocked in TNFR knockout mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In voltage clamp studies, transient I(A) and I(K) currents were suppressed and Na(v) 1.8 currents were enhanced by TNFalpha and UC supernatant, suggesting that multiple underlying mechanisms contributed to the enhanced excitability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: UC supernatants enhance neuronal excitability of sensory dorsal root ganglia neurons innervating the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TNFalpha is a key mediator which acts at neuronal TNFR1 to modulate K(v) and Na(v) currents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Together these data provide a number of potential new targets for pain management in UC </plain></SENT>
