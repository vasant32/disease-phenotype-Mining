<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The popular view of ileorectal anastomosis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> as an operation of above average mortality and morbidity is supported by the results of this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Great care must be taken to differentiate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> of the colon, as it is clear from consideration of their clinical course that they are different disease entities with a different prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the more general adoption of Aylett's operative technique would reduce the number of failures due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There appears to be a group of patients, 15% in this series, who will be failures because of intractable diarrhoea despite a technically adequate and successful operation, but it might be possible to reduce these with modern medical therapy given postoperatively.Patients with a preoperative history of more than 10 years' disease appear to do better than the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An actively diseased rectum does not appear adversely to affect the result, and the fulminating disease is not a counter indication to a staged ileorectal anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The use of steroids preoperatively does not appear to affect the healing of the anastomosis or the longterm result of the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No case of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the rectum has occurred in this series but there has been histological evidence of premalignant change in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The need for a strict follow-up programme, including regular sigmoidoscopy and rectal biopsy, is emphasized </plain></SENT>
