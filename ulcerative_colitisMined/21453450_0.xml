<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the usefulness of EG in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) by investigating the association between EG and colonoscopic findings and disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-seven UC patients undergoing EG and colonoscopy were invited to enroll </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EG findings were classified as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, homogeneous, random, or hard, and colonoscopic findings as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, mucosal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath>, punched-out <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, and extensive mucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0580209,C1456154,C1302752" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">abrasion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical findings were evaluated using clinical activity index (CAI) scores for each patient at colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On EG, 10 cases were classified as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, 11 as homogeneous, 6 as random, and 10 as hard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EG findings showed a significant correlation those of colonoscopy (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven of 10 (70%) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-type patients were in the remission phase, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6 random-type patients were in the active phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among active-phase patients, 4 of 7 (57%) homogeneous-type patients responded to steroid or leukocytapheresis therapy, while 3 of 6 (50%) random-type patients required treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three of 10 (30%) hard-type patients required colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this small series, EG findings reflected colonoscopic findings and correlated with disease activity among patients with UC </plain></SENT>
