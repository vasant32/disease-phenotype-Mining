<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The immunological response was studied using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blotting, and immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antibody response to two protoplasmic antigen preparations of M <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paratuberculosis</z:e> in the sera of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> was measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgG and IgM antibodies to these antigens were measured in serum samples from 52 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and 41 control patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although there was wide variation in the concentrations of antibody detected, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> had concentrations that were not significantly different from those of the other two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, mycobacterial antigens were separated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulphate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis and the immune response to each antigen was then examined separately and assayed for IgG and IgM in 10 patients from each of the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An indirect peroxidase test was also used to detect M <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paratuberculosis</z:e> in sections of tissue from 18 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and 10 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results were negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study does not support a role for M <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paratuberculosis</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
