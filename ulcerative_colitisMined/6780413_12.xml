<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some may develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, others have a limited, benign disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients with isolated <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> with a mean course of seven years were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a typical clinical picture consisting of a mild and intermittent course of the disease with the presenting symptom of rectal blood loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At endoscopic examination the inflammatory process was limited to the rectal and distal sigmoid colonic mucosa with a clear upper border beyond which the mucosa of the sigmoid colon was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histologically the mucosal biopsy specimens of the affected rectum resembled those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in contrast with <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> on the base of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, immunoperoxidase staining revealed a markedly increased number of IgE containing cells in the lamina propria of rectal mucosa biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As an IgE-mediated immune mechanism was considered to play a role in this type of <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp>, eight of the 12 patients were treated with oral administration of disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were improved by the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The remaining four patients with mild <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> did not require treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We concluded that, in patients with isolated <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> on clinical and immunopathological criteria, a group can be separated which responds to DSCG, a condition for which we suggest the name 'allergic <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp>' </plain></SENT>
