<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the effects of the free radical scavenger bis(1-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidinyl)decandioate (IAC) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="32149">sodium sulphate</z:chebi> (DSS) experimental model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>Colitis</z:hpo> was induced in Sprague Dawley male rats by administration of 5% DSS in drinking water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IAC (30 mg/kg, lipophilic or hydrophilic form) was administered daily (orally or ip) for 6 d until sacrifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Colonic damage was assessed by means of indirect (Disease Activity Index score) and direct measures (macroscopic and microscopic scores) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil infiltration within the tissue and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase activity were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DSS-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> impaired body <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and markedly increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> inflammatory parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six-day treatment with lipophilic IAC significantly reduced intestinal damage caused by <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, induced a down-regulation in MPO activity (0.72 +/- 0.12 and 0.45 +/- 0.12 with lipophilic IAC po and ip, respectively, vs 1.10 +/- 0.27 in untreated DSS <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> animals) and minimized DSS-induced neutrophil infiltration, while hydrophilic IAC administered orally did not ameliorate DSS-induced damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results support the hypothesis that reactive oxygen metabolites contribute to <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and that the radical scavenger IAC has therapeutic potential in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
