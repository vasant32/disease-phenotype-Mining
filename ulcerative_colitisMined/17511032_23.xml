<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of adalimumab induction therapy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> who previously responded to infliximab and then lost response or became intolerant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> were enrolled in a 4-wk open-label trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients received a loading dose of 160 mg adalimumab at wk 0 followed by 80 mg at wk 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy measure was clinical improvement at wk 4, as defined by a decrease in clinical activity index (CAI) of more than 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four of 10 patients (40%) benefited from subsequent adalimumab therapy; one patient achieved remission (CAI&lt;4) and 3 had clinical improvement at wk 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>6 patients had no response (60%); 2 of 6 (33.3%) subsequently underwent colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied by a decrease in median CRP concentration from 16.8 mg/mL at baseline to 3.85 mg/mL at wk 4, excluding two patients who underwent colectomy after two infusions of adalimumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 6 patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (CAI&gt;12) at baseline, none achieved remission and only one patient had clinical improvement at wk 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The small advantage of adalimumab in patients with mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and lost response or intolerance to infliximab needs to be confirmed in randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials </plain></SENT>
