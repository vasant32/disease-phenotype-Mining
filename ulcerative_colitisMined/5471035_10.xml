<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one patients had faecal stasis and 23 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pathological studies demonstrated an increase in the thickness of the inner spiral muscle in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> patients with faecal stasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The thickening was not as great as that seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preliminary studies on the motility patterns in patients with faecal stasis show a higher mean activity in the pelvic colon than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> but not as great as that seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pressure studies in patients with faecal stasis have shown <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> in the proximal colon associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>.The possible significance of these results is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> may initiate a motility disturbance which leads to muscle thickening similar to that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diverticula associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> are usually not involved in the mucosal inflammatory process </plain></SENT>
