<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50667">6-mercaptopurine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6-MP</z:chebi>) in cases of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> (AZA) hypersensitivity in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty nine previously confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) (n = 14) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) (n = 15) patients with a known previous (AZA) hypersensitivity reaction were studied prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6-MP</z:chebi> doses were gradually increased from 0.5 up to 1.0-1.5 mg/kg per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical activity indicies (CDAI/CAI), laboratory variables and daily doses of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6-MP</z:chebi> were assessed before and in the first, sixth and twelfth months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 9 patients, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6-MP</z:chebi> was withdrawn in the first 2 wk due to an early hypersensitivity reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Medication was ineffective within 6 mo in 6 CD patients, and myelotoxic reaction was observed in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were evaluated at the end of the sixth month in 12 (8 UC, 4 CD) patients, and after the first year in 9 (6 UC, 3 CD) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CDAI decreased transiently at the end of the sixth month, but no significant changes were observed in the CDAI or the CAI values at the end of the year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Leukocyte counts (P = 0.01), CRP (P = 0.02), and serum iron (P = 0.05) values indicated decreased inflammatory reactions, especially in the UC patients at the end of the year, making the possibility to taper oral steroid doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: About one-third of the previously AZA-intolerant patients showed adverse effects on taking <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6MP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In our series, 20 patients tolerated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6MP</z:chebi>, but it was ineffective in 8 CD cases, and valuable mainly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
