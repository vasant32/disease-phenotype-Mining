<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> (IBDs), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> have seen notable successes culminating in the discovery of 99 published susceptibility loci/genes (71 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>; 47 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>) to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Approximately one-third of loci described confer susceptibility to both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Amongst these are multiple genes involved in IL23/Th17 signalling (IL23R, IL12B, JAK2, TYK2 and STAT3), IL10, IL1R2, REL, CARD9, NKX2.3, ICOSLG, PRDM1, SMAD3 and ORMDL3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The evolving genetic architecture of IBD has furthered our understanding of disease pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, defective processing of intracellular bacteria has become a central theme, following gene discoveries in autophagy and innate immunity (associations with NOD2, IRGM, ATG16L1 are specific to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genetic evidence has also demonstrated the importance of barrier function to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (HNF4A, LAMB1, CDH1 and GNA12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, when the data are analysed in more detail, deeper themes emerge including the shared susceptibility seen with other diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Many <z:mpath ids='MPATH_194'>immune-mediated diseases</z:mpath> overlap in this respect, paralleling the reported epidemiological evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, in several cases the reported shared susceptibility appears at odds with the clinical picture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Examples include both type 1 and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this review we will detail the presently available data on the genetic overlap between IBD and other diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The discussion will be informed by the epidemiological data in the published literature and the implications for pathogenesis and therapy will be outlined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This arena will move forwards very quickly in the next few years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Ultimately, we anticipate that these genetic insights will transform the landscape of common complex diseases such as IBD </plain></SENT>
