<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Several antibodies have been reported in the sera of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most commonly described are anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28808">mannan</z:chebi> antibodies (ASCA) in CD and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (pANCA) in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Familial clustering of these antibodies has been described, suggesting they might be genetic markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate the presence of these antibodies before the emergence of overt clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Since 1980, the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) Medical Corps Serum Repository has stored serum samples obtained systematically from 5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recruits on enlistment, and from the same population on discharge from compulsory military service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We evaluated serum samples obtained from 32 subjects with CD and eight with UC before they were clinically diagnosed, along with samples from matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ASCA were present in 10/32 (31.3%) CD patients before clinical diagnosis compared with 0/95 (0%) controls (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the eight patients with serum samples available before diagnosis of UC were ASCA positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ASCA was positive in 54.5% of patients after diagnosis of CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean interval between ASCA detection and diagnosis was 38 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 90% of patients, antibodies were detected in the first available serum sample; therefore, measurements of the average time from the presence of ASCA to diagnosis may be even longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>pANCA were present in 2/8 (25%) patients with available sera before the diagnosis of UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>None of their 24 matched controls were positive (p = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ASCA and pANCA may predict development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> years before the disease is clinically diagnosed </plain></SENT>
