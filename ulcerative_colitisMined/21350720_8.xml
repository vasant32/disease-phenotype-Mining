<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this brief report we aimed to assess the application of probe-based CLE to characterize colonic mucosa and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in CUC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study involved a patient presenting long-standing CUC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Confocal imaging of both the inflamed mucosa, a circumscribed lesion (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-associated lesional mass), and adjacent colonic mucosa are demonstrated and the correlation between the CLE and histological images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inflamed mucosa and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> showed specific alteration of crypt architecture, cellular infiltration, and vessel architecture with an excellent correlation between CLE and standard histological examination </plain></SENT>
