<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No paediatric reports are available on intestinal endogenous microflora in IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To investigate and characterise the predominant composition of the mucosa-associated intestinal microflora in colonoscopic biopsy specimens of paediatric patients with newly diagnosed IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mucosa-associated bacteria were quantified and isolated from biopsy specimens of the ileum, caecum and rectum obtained at colonoscopy in 12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 7 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, 6 with indeterminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, 10 with lymphonodular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> of the distal ileum and in 7 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Isolation and characterisation were carried out by conventional culture techniques for aerobic and facultative-anaerobic microorganisms, and molecular analysis (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="26833">16S</z:chebi> rRNA-based amplification and real-time polymerase chain reaction assays) for the detection of anaerobic <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> groups or species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A higher number of mucosa-associated aerobic and facultative-anaerobic bacteria were found in biopsy specimens of children with IBD than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An overall decrease in some <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> species or groups belonging to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> anaerobic intestinal flora was suggested by molecular approaches; in particular, occurrence of Bacteroides vulgatus was low in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and indeterminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first paediatric report investigating the intestinal mucosa-associated microflora in patients of the IBD spectrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results, although limited by the sample size, allow a better understanding of changes in mucosa-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> flora in these patients, showing either a predominance of some potentially harmful <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> groups or a decrease in beneficial <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data underline the central role of mucosa-adherent bacteria in IBD </plain></SENT>
