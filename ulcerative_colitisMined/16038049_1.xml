<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Changes of pathological signs and histological grading of 106 patients with active UC were observed before and after the treatment with SASP, 1 g, thrice daily for 6 wk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The effect of SASP on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in lamina propria was 48.2% and 17.4% in the mild active UC (P&lt;0.001) and 68% and 26.7% in the moderate active UC (P&lt;0.001) before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023267" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Fibroid</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of vessel wall was found in one case of mild UC and two cases of moderate UC before treatment and was not found after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was found in mild UC before and after treatment, while <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was found in one case of moderate UC before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect on mucosal glandular abnormality was 30.4% and 13.0% in mild UC (P&lt;0.05), and 42% and 40% in moderate UC (P&gt;0.05) before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of eosinophil infiltration was 98.2% and 80.4% in mild UC (P&lt;0.01), and 100% and 91.1% in moderate UC (P&lt;0.05) before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect on crypt <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> was 21.4% and 4.4% in mild UC (P&lt;0.05), and 48% and 13.3% in moderate UC (P&lt;0.001) before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effect on mucosal pathohistological grading was 2.00+/-0.84 and 0.91+/-0.46 in mild UC (P&lt;0.001), and 2.49+/-0.84 and 1.31+/-0.75 in moderate UC (P&lt;0.001) before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SASP can improve small vessel lesions and <z:mp ids='MP_0000491'>crypt abscesses</z:mp> and reduce neutrophilic and eosinophilic <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> in inflammatory mucosa of UC </plain></SENT>
