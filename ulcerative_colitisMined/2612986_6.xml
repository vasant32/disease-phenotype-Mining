<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the effect of these reservoirs on digestive function, circulating and morphologic gut <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> responses were measured in patients with a continent ileostomy or with a pelvic pouch and compared to patients with conventional ileostomy, with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight subjects were studied in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Basal and postprandial plasma gastrin, enteroglucagon, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7542">neurotensin</z:chebi>, vasoactive intestinal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi>, insulin, pancreatic glucagon, and pancreatic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> in both groups with ileal reservoirs were equivalent to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basal plasma motilin and postprandial plasma gastric inhibitory <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> were raised in ileal reservoir patients, but similar changes also occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients and those with conventional ileostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one half of patients, cell populations of enteroglucagon, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> YY, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7542">neurotensin</z:chebi> were decreased in pouch mucosa that corresponded with the presence of mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, with pouch <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> vasoactive intestinal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> immunoreactive nerves were increased and a proportion of the fibres were moderately coarsened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mucosal concentrations of vasoactive intestinal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> did not, however, exceed that of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After an ileal reservoir sufficient reserve remains for gut hormone release into the circulation, suggesting compensation for the presence of a reservoir and the absence of a colon; circulating hormone changes do occur but are consequent upon previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reservoirs may show neuromorphologic alterations that appear to be related to mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
