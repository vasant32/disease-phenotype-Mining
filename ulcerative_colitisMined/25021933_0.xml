<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>K8, K18 and K19 constitute the main keratins in the intestinal epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Keratin alteration may play a role in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>K8 -/- mice develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0100281'>chronic colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>K8 and K18 play a role in TNF-α induced-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown increased expression of insoluble K8, K18 and K19 in long-standing UC relative to recent - <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (≤5 years) using mass spectrometry (MS) in the IF fraction of pooled patient samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to use antibody-based relative quantification of K8, K18, K19 in individual patient samples to validate MS results and describe variation in expression across the cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IF proteins were extracted from individual biopsies in patients with long-standing pan-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (LSPC) in clinical, endoscopic and histological remission (n = 10) and with recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (ROUC) also in remission (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Each sample was dot-blotted on a membrane followed by immunoblotting for identification and quantification of keratins (8, 18 and19) sequentially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MCF-7 cell line was used as control in each experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Relative Keratins concentration for each dot- blotted sample was inferred by determining its signal intensity relative to the MCF-7 keratins signal intensity measured in turn by densitometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis to compare the two groups was made separately for K8, K18, K19 using Mann-Whitney U test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median relative IF protein levels in patients with LSPC were 1.54, 0.41 and 2.12 for K8, K18 and K19, respectively were significantly higher than those with ROUC: 0.03, 0.05 and 0.07 for K8 (p = 0.001), K18 (p = 0.002) and K19 (p = 0.021), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Median Baron's endoscopy score in patients with LSPC and ROUC were 0 (range 0-1) and 1 (range 0-1), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Median histological activity index in both groups were 0 (range 0-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study confirms increased expression of insoluble keratins in colonic epithelial cells during LSPC in remission relative to the levels in ROUC and validate our previous MS observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Restoration of keratins in quiescent LSPC may be a protective mechanism against recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
