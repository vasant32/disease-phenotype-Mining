<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to isolate an IEL population from the human colon to activate CD3 + IEL by a human colonic epithelial cell line (HT-29), bearing different concentrations of class II antigen (HLA-DR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IEL were isolated by a mechanical method from six patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and from 14 control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IEL were cocultured with HT-29 which had been induced to express class II molecules by gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) in a dose dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The phenotype and the subsequent expression of activation markers by the IEL were determined to two colour flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IEL population had a CD4/CD8 ratio similar to that seen in tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the mixed cell culture, the degree of IEL activation showed a positive correlation with the degree of HLA-DR expression by the HT29 cells and the IEL secreted a IFN-gamma like factor that in turn stimulated the HT-29 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, depending on their expression of HLA molecules, colonic epithelial cells are able to activate CD3+CD8+IEL </plain></SENT>
