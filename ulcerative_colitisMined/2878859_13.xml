<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Administration of this drug to patients intolerant of sulphasalazine, however, occasionally results in liquid stools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In preliminary experiments, which comprised 10 healthy volunteers treated with colectomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, ileostomy fluid output increased (p less than 0.001) during oral intake of azodisal <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (1 g/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a double blind, placebo controlled crossover study, comprising eight similar volunteers, ileostomy fluid output increased (p less than 0.05) in a dose related manner during intake of azodisal <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (1 g/day vs 2 g/day) compared with placebo or sulphasalazine (2 g/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> (PG)F2 alpha in free ileal water determined by equilibrium in vivo dialysis of ileostomy contents decreased (p less than 0.05) during intake of azodisal <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (2 g/day), whereas concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> and the output of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi>, PGF2 alpha, and '<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> + PGF2 alpha' remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus increased formation of PGs is apparently not the cause of increased ileostomy fluid output associated with azodisalicylate intake </plain></SENT>
