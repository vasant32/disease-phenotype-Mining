<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Like CrD, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coeliac disease</z:e> (CoD) is an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) associated with (auto) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Performing a multicenter study we primarily aimed to determine the performance of ASCA, NANA and PAB tests for IBD diagnosis in children and adults, and secondarily to evaluate the prevalence of these markers in CoD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sera of 109 patients with CrD, 78 with UC, 45 with CoD and 50 healthy blood donors were retrospectively included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ASCA, NANA and PAB were detected by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ASCA+/NANA- profile displayed a positive predictive value of 94.2% for CrD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Detection of ASCA was correlated with a more severe clinical profile of CrD and treatment of the disease did not influence their serum levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ASCA positivity was found in 37.9% of active CoD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PAB were found in 36.7% CrD and 13.3% CoD patients and were not correlated with clinical features of CrD, except with an early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifteen CrD patients were ASCA negative and PAB positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ASCA and PAB detected by IIF are specific markers for CrD although their presence does not rule out a possible active CoD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The combination of ASCA, NANA and PAB tests improves the sensitivity of immunological markers for CrD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Repeating ASCA, NANA, and PAB testing during the course of CrD has no clinical value </plain></SENT>
