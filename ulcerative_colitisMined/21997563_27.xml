<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Variability in endoscopic assessment necessitates rigorous investigation of descriptors for scoring severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate variation in the overall endoscopic assessment of severity, the intra- and interindividual variation of descriptive terms and to create an <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative Colitis</z:hpo> Endoscopic Index of Severity which could be validated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A two-phase study used a library of 670 video sigmoidoscopies from patients with Mayo Clinic scores 0-11, supplemented by 10 videos from five people without UC and five hospitalised patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> severe UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In phase 1, each of 10 investigators viewed 16/24 videos to assess agreement on the Baron score with a central reader and agreed definitions of 10 endoscopic descriptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In phase 2, each of 30 different investigators rated 25/60 different videos for the descriptors and assessed overall severity on a 0-100 visual analogue scale. κ Statistics tested inter- and intraobserver variability for each descriptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A general linear mixed regression model based on logit link and β distribution of variance was used to predict overall endoscopic severity from descriptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was 76% agreement for 'severe', but 27% agreement for '<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>' appearances between phase I investigators and the central reader </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In phase 2, weighted κ values ranged from 0.34 to 0.65 and 0.30 to 0.45 within and between observers for the 10 descriptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The final model incorporated vascular pattern, (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>/patchy/complete obliteration) <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (none/mucosal/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> mild/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> moderate or severe), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> (none/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath>/superficial/deep), each with precise definitions, which explained 90% of the variance (pR(2), Akaike Information Criterion) in the overall assessment of endoscopic severity, predictions varying from 4 to 93 on a 100-point scale (from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> to worst endoscopic severity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative Colitis</z:hpo> Endoscopic Index of Severity accurately predicts overall assessment of endoscopic severity of UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Validity and responsiveness need further testing before it can be applied as an outcome measure in clinical trials or clinical practice </plain></SENT>
