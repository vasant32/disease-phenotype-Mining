<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To compare the clinical outcome of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) patients with and without antiviral therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective case-controlled study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The database of UC patients in our institution was scanned for documented presence of CMV on colonic biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographics, clinical data, endoscopy findings and pathology reports were extracted from the patients' charts and electronic records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When available, the data from colonoscopies preceding and following the diagnosis of colonic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> were also extracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcomes of the study were colectomy/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> during hospitalization and the secondary outcomes were colectomy/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> through the course of the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen patients were included in the study, 7 (53.5%) of them were treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="465284">gancyclovir</z:chebi> and 6 (46.5%) were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22587">antivirals</z:chebi> presented with a more severe disease and 57% of them were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> or infliximab before initiation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="465284">gancyclovir</z:chebi>, while none of the patients without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22587">antivirals</z:chebi> required rescue therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient died and another patient underwent urgent colectomy during hospitalization, both of them from the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="465284">gancyclovir</z:chebi>-treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For the entire follow-up time (13 Â± 13 mo), a total of 3 colectomies and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> among the antiviral-treated patients (for colectomy: 3/7 vs 0/6 patients, P = 0.19; for combined adverse outcome: 4/7 vs 0/6 patients, P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 9/13 patients, immunohistochemistry for CMV was performed on biopsies obtained during a subsequent colonoscopy and was positive in one patient only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="465284">Gancyclovir</z:chebi>-treated patients had a more severe disease and outcome, probably unrelated to antiviral therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry-CMV-positive patients with mild disease may recover without antiviral therapy </plain></SENT>
