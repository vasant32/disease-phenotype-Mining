<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and fifty nine immunoglobulin secreting hybridomas have been obtained from nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antibodies have been screened for binding to food antigens, sections of human gut, and bacteria including two unidentified acid fast isolates from CD lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Autoantibodies, and antibodies to food antigens implicated by others in the aetiology of CD were rare, comprising 1.2%, and 2.5% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most donors yielded none of these </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus neither food antigens nor autoantigens are major antigenic stimuli in nodes draining <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand between 19% and 83% of supernatants from different donors bound to one or more <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> genus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mycobacteria and the CD isolates were amongst the genera to which most antibodies bound, though binding to E coli was more frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significantly more CD than UC derived supernatants bound to BCG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As mycobacteria are not though to be part of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bowel flora, the high percentage of hybridomas secreting antibodies which bind to this genus is surprising </plain></SENT>
