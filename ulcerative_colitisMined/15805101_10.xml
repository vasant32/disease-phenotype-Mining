<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Bradykinin is a mediator of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, responsible for pain, vasodilation, and capillary permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bradykinin receptor 1 (B(1)R) and bradykinin receptor 2 (B(2)R) are G protein-coupled receptors that mediate kinin effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The latter is constitutive and rapidly desensitized; the former is induced by inflammatory cytokines and resistant to densensitization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distribution of bradykinin receptors in human intestinal tissue was studied in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD), namely <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both B(2)R and B(1)R proteins are expressed in the epithelial cells of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and IBD intestines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>B(1)R protein is visualized in macrophages at the center of granulomas in CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>B(2)R protein is normally present in the apexes of enterocytes in the basal area and intracellularly in inflammatory tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, B(1)R protein is found in the basal area of enterocytes in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intestine but in the apical portion of enterocytes in inflamed tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>B(1)R protein is significantly increased in both active UC and CD intestines compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with active UC, B(1)R <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is significantly higher than B(2)R <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in inactive UC patients, the B(1)R and B(2)R <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> did not differ significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus bradykinin receptors in IBD may reflect <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Increased B(1)R gene and protein expression in active IBD provides a structural basis of the important role of bradykinin in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
