<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A substantial proportion of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) develops <z:hpo ids='HP_0000938'>osteopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> in the course of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent data from a mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> suggest that the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANKL)/osteoprotegerin (OPG) system may be responsible for bone loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated the activation state of the RANKL/OPG system and its association with bone loss in human IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of OPG and RANKL were correlated with bone mineral density and current IBD therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colonic secretion of OPG and RANKL and cell types responsible for such secretion were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: OPG plasma levels were elevated 2.4-fold in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and 1.9-fold in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) whereas soluble RANKL (sRANKL) levels were not significantly different in IBD patients compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High levels of OPG were released from colonic explant cultures (CEC) derived from inflamed IBD specimens, and colonic macrophages and dendritic cells costained for OPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>sRANKL levels from CEC were low both in IBD patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, increased expression of RANKL was mainly confined to cells in the lamina muscularis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant negative correlation was found between OPG plasma levels and femoral neck/lumbar spine bone mineral density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that IBD is associated with alterations in the RANKL/OPG system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Applying results from a murine model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> associated bone loss, the constellation of OPG and sRANKL regulation observed in our study raises the possibility that RANKL/OPG may contribute to the development of bone loss in IBD </plain></SENT>
