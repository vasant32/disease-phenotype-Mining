<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The movement of neutrophils into the colonic mucosa in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> is induced by chemokines including interleukin 8 (IL8) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">leukotriene B4</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">LTB4</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To compare the ability of mucosa from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients and controls to stimulate neutrophil movement, to define the contribution of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">LTB4</z:chebi> to this, and to define the relative biological importance of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">LTB4</z:chebi> and IL8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Resected mucosa was obtained from seven control patients and 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mucosal homogenate supernatants were used to stimulate isolated neutrophils and the effect assessed by the neutrophil shape change response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Responses were inhibited with either the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">LTB4</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> SC41930- or neutralising anti-IL8 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">LTB4</z:chebi> was extracted and assayed by RIA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Homogenate supernatants from inflamed mucosa were more bioactive (median 1.2 mg/ml-1 induced 50% response) than those from uninflamed mucosa (4.25 mg/ml-1 induced 50% response; difference 2.8 mg/ml-1 (96.5% CI 0.5 to 6.1, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Maximal inhibition by SC41930 of the response was significantly greater in inflamed mucosa (54% median) than in uninflamed mucosa (34%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This inhibition correlated with the level of immunoreactive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">LTB4</z:chebi> (r = 0.78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Anti-IL8 reduced bioactivity of homogenate supernatants from inflamed mucosa (at 1:10 dilution) by 11.4% (IQR 1.2 to 51.8, p = 0.021) whereas SC41930 reduced it by 54.8% (35.6 to 77.5, p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Inflamed colonic mucosa releases more neutrophil movement inducing bioactivity than uninflamed mucosa, and has greater <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">LTB4</z:chebi> dependent activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It yields both IL8 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">LTB4</z:chebi> dependent activity but greater <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">LTB4</z:chebi> dependent activity </plain></SENT>
