<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous studies have attempted to link hygiene hypothesis with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However most of these studies come from developed countries where the level of hygiene is high and universal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Very little data is available from developing countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study explores the truth of hygiene hypotheses and other risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) in a North Indian population where the prevalence of UC has been increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 518 patients diagnosed with UC and 188 age-matched controls were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A structured questionnaire concerning socio-demographics and level of hygiene was completed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis was used to study the association between hygiene-related factors and the risk for UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a higher proportion of females (P&lt;0.001), and a higher educational status (P=0.01) in UC patients compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A family history of IBD was present in 7.2% of cases and non-existent in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, after accounting for potential confounders, having a private bed (P&lt;0.001), and having better toilet facilities [(RCA versus none, P=0.01; Flush toilet versus none, P=0.01), (RCA LATRINE as a toilet technology used in rural areas where no flush facility exists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It was developed under RCA project)] were inversely associated with risk for UC whereas owning a pet (P=0.01) and stressful events like a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the family (P=0.01) were associated with greater risks for UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study does not provide definitive evidence to support hygiene hypothesis and rather suggests that the rising incidence of UC in North India may be attributable to inadequate sanitary measures or other as yet unidentified factors </plain></SENT>
