<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal-pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) has some peculiarities in paediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary aim was to compare the bowel function of patients undergoing IPAA between those operated on in childhood and adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The secondary aim was to compare the quality of life (QoL) and outcomes for children between medical and surgical therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Children undergoing IPAA were compared with adult patients undergoing IPAA between 2007 and 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Function was assessed 1 year after ileostomy closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Function and QoL of medically managed paediatric patients were compared with their surgical counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twelve paediatric IPAA patients were compared with 24 adult ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> presentation was common in the former, usually after failed biological treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> was more frequent in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Younger patients exhibited a trend toward better discrimination and continence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>QoL was excellent in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Twelve medically treated children were enrolled for secondary aim </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Functioning was similar in IPAA- and medically managed children, but the former had a better QoL, confirmed by parents' perception </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Similar function is achieved by IPAA in childhood or adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>IPAA may offer a better QoL compared to prolonged medical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effects of IPAA experienced by children were similarly observed by their parents </plain></SENT>
