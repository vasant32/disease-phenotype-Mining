<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten smokers were also examined on two occasions, one of which included smoking a cigarette </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> concentrations were measured in smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects showed a pronounced fall in rectal blood flow in the first 30 minutes and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> had significantly higher values compared with smokers (p less than 0.002; p less than 0.04) and non-smokers (p less than 0.007; p less than 0.002) during the first and second 30 minutes respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Values in smokers and non-smokers were similar, but smoking a cigarette was associated with a significant fall in blood flow (p less than 0.04) and this change was inversely related to the rise in plasma <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> concentration (r = -0.63; p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The findings may be relevant to the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and the smoking history </plain></SENT>
