<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The involvement of a cortical influence in the brain-gut axis as well as the interaction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system provide an initial explanation of the psychological symptoms associated with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The involvement of structures the limbic system, such as the anterior cingulate cortex, the prefrontal cortex, and the amygdala, paves the way for the discovery of the mechanisms underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, alexithymia, personality traits, and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0848772" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological impairments</z:e> following the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Psychiatric therapy in IBD patients is almost as important as the gastroenterological approach and consists of pharmacological treatment and psychotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither of the available psychiatric treatment methods is considered the golden standard because both methods have side effects, and psychotropic medication can provoke the worsening of IBD symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, both approaches must be applied with awareness of the possibility of side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We suggest that psychiatrists and gastroenterologists work together to reach a consensus on IBD therapy to ensure success and to reduce side effects and relapse to the lowest possible rates </plain></SENT>
