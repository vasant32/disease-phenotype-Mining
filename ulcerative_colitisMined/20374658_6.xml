<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Acupuncture-type treatments are among the most popular options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several studies have reported that moxibustion is effective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this review was to assess the clinical evidence for or against moxibustion as a treatment for UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched the literature using 18 databases from their inception to February 10, 2010, without language restrictions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We included randomized clinical trials (RCTs), in which human patients with UC were treated with moxibustion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Studies were included if they were placebo-controlled or controlled against a drug therapy or no treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The methodological quality of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> RCTs was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, five RCTs were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were of low methodological quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They compared the effects of moxibustion with conventional drug therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three tested moxibustion against <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">sulfasalazine</z:chebi> and two against <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">sulfasalazine</z:chebi> plus other drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis of five RCTs showed favorable effects of moxibustion on the response rate compared to conventional drug therapy (n = 407; risk ratio = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.11 to 1.38; P &lt; 0.0001; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>: I2 = 16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence is insufficient to show that moxibustion is an effective treatment of UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Most of included trials had high risk of bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>More rigorous studies seem warranted </plain></SENT>
