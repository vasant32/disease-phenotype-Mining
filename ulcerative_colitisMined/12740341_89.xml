<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>Intestinal inflammation</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) is characterised by an influx of neutrophils into the intestinal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>S100A12 is a calcium binding protein with proinflammatory properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is secreted by activated neutrophils and interacts with the multiligand receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Promising anti-inflammatory effects of blocking agents for RAGE have been reported in murine models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To investigate expression and serum concentrations of S100A12 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed immunohistochemical studies and immunofluorescence microscopy in biopsies from patients with CD and UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>S100A12 serum concentrations were analysed using a sandwich ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immunohistochemical studies revealed profound expression of S100A12 in inflamed intestinal tissue from IBD patients whereas no expression was found in tissue from healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Staining for S100A12 during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> active CD and UC was restricted to infiltrating neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serum S100A12 levels were significantly elevated in patients with active CD (470 (125) ng/ml; p&lt;0.001, n=30) as well as those with active UC (400 (120) ng/ml; p&lt;0.01, n=15) compared with healthy controls (75 (15) ng/ml; n=30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Even in inactive disease, elevated serum concentrations were found, at least in CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>S100A12 levels were well correlated with disease activity in CD and UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that neutrophil derived S100A12 is strongly upregulated during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> active IBD, suggesting an important role during the pathogenesis of IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Serum S100A12 may serve as a useful marker for disease activity in patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
