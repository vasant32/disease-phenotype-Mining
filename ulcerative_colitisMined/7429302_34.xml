<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of these studies is to determine the colonic myoelectrical and contractile response after eating a 1000 calorie meal in patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During fasting, slow waves are identifiable significantly more in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (p &lt; 0  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The predominant slow wave frequency is 6  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>1 +/- 0  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2 cycles/min, which is similar to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The slow waves are not altered by eating in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Minimal spike or contractile activity occurs during the fasting period both in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, spike activity increases rapidly after eating the 1000 calorie meal (P &lt; 0  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>01), but the maximal response is decreased and shorter in duration than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There is no simultaneous increase in colonic contractility above fasting levels after the meal in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is strikingly different from the simultaneous increase in contractile and spike activity (P &lt; 0  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>01) that occurs after eating in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (1) the colonic smooth muscle slow wave activity is intact; and (2) a disturbance in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic contractile response to eating is present despite an adequate spike response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This lack of colonic contractility may contribute to the increase in diarrhoea that occurs in these patients after eating </plain></SENT>
