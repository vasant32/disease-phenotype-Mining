<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Information was retrieved from MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The induction of remission and promotion of maintenance were compared between probiotics treatment and non-probiotics treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen randomized controlled studies met the selection criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven studies evaluated the remission rate, and eight studies estimated the recurrence rate; two studies evaluated both remission and recurrence rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with the non-probiotics group, the remission rate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients who received probiotics was 1.35 (95% CI: 0.98-1.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with the placebo group, the remission rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> who received probiotics was 2.00 (95% CI: 1.35-2.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the course of treatment, in patients who received probiotics for less than 12 mo compared with the group treated by non-probiotics, the remission rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> was 1.36 (95% CI: 1.07-1.73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with the non-probiotics group, the recurrence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients who received probiotics was 0.69 (95% CI: 2.47-1.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the mild to moderate group who received probiotics, compared to the group who did not receive probiotics, the recurrence rate was 0.25 (95% CI: 0.12-0.51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The group who received Bifidobacterium bifidum treatment had a recurrence rate of 0.25 (95% CI: 0.12-0.50) compared with the non-probiotics group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Probiotic treatment was more effective than placebo in maintaining remission in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
