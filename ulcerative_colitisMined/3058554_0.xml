<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, oenological prejudices were challenged by the use of a points scoring system (from 50 to 100) to evaluate wine in a book now widely regarded as one of the most authoritative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On this scale, a 1981 Chateau Citran described as 'emaciated' scored 65, a 1983 Chateau Kirwan scored 85, and a 1982 Petrus 100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="?"><plain>If the same approach were used for drugs used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> to quantify an advance over conditions existing at the time of its introduction how would they score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because they were the first available drugs in their class and clearly constituted major advances, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and sulphasalazine both score 95, the score being limited by a high level of side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The new <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30762">salicylates</z:chebi> score 75, because they extend the benefits of sulphasalazine to a minority of patients but they have the potential to score 90 if increased dosing and greater effectiveness over sulphasalazine can be achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="30762">Salicylate</z:chebi> enemas score 80, because they advance treatment over topical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> for patients with resistant distal disease, but the mode of delivery needs improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Steroid foams also score 80, particularly if the patient's vote is taken into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">Azathioprine</z:chebi>'s score cannot be calculated because there is doubt over its efficacy, but it is potentially 88 if it saves patients with difficult disease from colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We can only guess what an oral non-absorbed steroid would score, but if response rates for relapse were substantially improved, or if <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> could be used as effective maintenance treatment, it could be as high as 95 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There are indications that we should 'watch this space' </plain></SENT>
