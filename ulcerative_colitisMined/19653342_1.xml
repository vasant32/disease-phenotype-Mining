<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To detect a possible association between the polymorphism of the (-670 A/G) Fas/Apo1 gene promoter and susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) in the Tunisian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The (-670 A/G) Fas polymorphism was analyzed in 105 patients with CD, 59 patients with UC, and 100 controls using the polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significantly lower frequencies of the Fas -670 A allele and A/A homozygous individuals were observed in CD and UC patients when compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of (-670 A/G) Fas polymorphism with respect to sex in CD and UC showed a significant difference in A/A genotypes between female patients and controls (P corrected = 0.004 in CD patients and P corrected = 0.02 in UC patients, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis also showed a statistically significant association between genotype AA of the (-670 A/G) polymorphism and the ileum localization of the lesions (P corrected = 0.048) and between genotype GG and the colon localization (P corrected = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> patients according to clinical behavior revealed no difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Fas-670 polymorphism was associated with the development of CD and UC in the Tunisian population </plain></SENT>
