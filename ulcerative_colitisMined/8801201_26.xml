<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients had higher ICTP values (3.69 (SD 1.40) microgram/l) than the healthy controls (3.25 (1.00) microgram/l, p = 0.035), but no differences in serum PICP and osteocalcin between these groups were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the patients, the ICTP, PICP, and osteocalcin values did not have any significant correlation with BMD, but the patients with ICTP values above 3.6 microgram/l had significantly lower Z scores than those with lower ICTP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the controls, however, a positive correlation between serum ICTP and BMD was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients with total <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> had higher values of ICTP (3.96 (1.58) microgram/l) than those with a left sided disease (3.04 (0.86) micrograms/l, p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients with a history of clinically active disease (n = 20) had higher ICTP (4.58 (1.55) microgram/l) and osteocalcin (12.56 (5.64) microgram/l) values than the patients (n = 130) with quiescent disease (ICTP 3.56 (1.33), p = 0.002, and osteocalcin 9.76 (3.62), p = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased serum osteocalcin, PICP, and ICTP concentrations and <z:mp ids='MP_0000063'>reduced BMD</z:mp> Z scores were found in a subgroup of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients with a history of an active disease (n = 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Raised serum ICTP and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values of osteocalcin and PICP in IBD patients show increased breakdown of type I collagen without a compensatory increase in its synthesis suggesting an increased rate of bone degradation as a probable mechanism for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000938'>osteopenia</z:hpo> in IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Raised ICTP values are related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004349'>reduced bone mineral densities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
