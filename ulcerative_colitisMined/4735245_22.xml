<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Levels of kininogen, kallikrein, and kallikrein precursor were measured in blood-free tissue samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon tissue a kininogen occurred in the muscle and none was detected in the mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Kallikrein and its precursor were found in mucosa but not in muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In acutely inflamed tissue from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients relatively high levels of active kallikrein were detected in the underlying colonic muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was little change in the level of kallikrein in inflamed mucosa or of kininogen in the muscle of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No kallikrein was found in colonic muscle from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticular disease</z:e> and the mucosal kallikrein level in these patients was unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest a mechanism for the formation of kinins in the wall of the colon which is present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> but not in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
