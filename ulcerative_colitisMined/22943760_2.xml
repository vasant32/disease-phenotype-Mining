<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study compares risk estimates for predictors of postoperative complication derived from administrative data against that of chart review and evaluates the accuracy of administrative coding for this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Hospital administrative databases were used to identify adults with UC undergoing colectomy from 1996-2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical charts were reviewed and regression analyses comparing chart versus administrative data were performed to assess the effect of age, emergent operation, and Charlson comorbidities on the occurrence of postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative predictive values of administrative coding for identifying the study population, Charlson comorbidities, and postoperative complications were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to chart review, administrative data estimated a higher magnitude of effect for emergent admission (OR 2.52 [95% CI: 1.80-3.52] versus 1.49 [1.06-2.09]) and Charlson comorbidities (OR 2.91 [1.86-4.56] versus 1.50 [1.05-2.15]) as predictors of postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Administrative data correctly identified UC and colectomy in 85.9% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The administrative database was 37% sensitive in identifying patients with ≥ 1Charlson comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Restricting analysis to active comorbidities increased the sensitivity to 63% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of identifying patients with at least one postoperative complication was 68%; restricting analysis to more severe complications improved the sensitivity to 84% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Administrative data identified the same risk factors for postoperative complications as chart review, but overestimated the magnitude of risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This discrepancy may be explained by coding inaccuracies that selectively identifying the most serious complications and comorbidities </plain></SENT>
