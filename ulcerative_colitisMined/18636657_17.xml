<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Selection criteria have been optimized to increase the yield of capsule endoscopy in patients suspected to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Capsule endoscopy allows for earlier diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> of the small bowel and improved diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in patients where it is unclear if they suffer from Crohn's or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A test capsule is available to assess for small bowel strictures and thus avoid capsule retention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A common language has been developed and a new scoring index will be added to capsule software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is envisioned that the manner in which we treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> in the future will change, based on earlier diagnosis and treatment aimed at mucosal healing rather than symptom improvement </plain></SENT>
