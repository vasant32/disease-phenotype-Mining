<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To demonstrate the therapeutic effect of probiotics in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), and their effect on <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty patients with mild to moderate UC were randomly classified into two groups: <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">sulfasalazine</z:chebi> group, who received <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">sulfasalazine</z:chebi> 2400 mg/d; and probiotic group, who received <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">sulfasalazine</z:chebi> 2400 mg/d with probiotic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were investigated before and after 8 wk of treatment with probiotic (Lactobacillus delbruekii and Lactobacillus fermentum) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Colonic activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) was assayed with UV spectrophotometry, the colonic content of interleukin (IL)-6 was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), fecal calprotectin was determined by ELISA, and expression of NF-kappaB p65 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-alpha proteins in colonic tissue was identified by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the start of the study, colonic mucosal injury and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> were demonstrated in UC patients by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining, and an increase in colonic MPO activity, fecal calprotectin, and expression of colonic TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB p65 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The use of probiotic for 8 wk significantly ameliorated the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> by decreasing the colonic concentration of IL-6, expression of TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB p65, leukocyte recruitment, as demonstrated by a decrease in colonic MPO activity, and the level of fecal calprotectin compared to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">sulfasalazine</z:chebi> group and the control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Oral supplementation with probiotics could be helpful in maintaining remission and preventing relapse of UC </plain></SENT>
