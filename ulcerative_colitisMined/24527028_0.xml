<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sense of coherence (SOC) is a health-promoting concept reflecting a person's view of life and response to stressful situations and may be of importance in coping with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to explore associations between SOC and sociodemographic, disease-related, and personal characteristics in a sample of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measures included sociodemographic and disease-related data, the Sense of Coherence Scale, General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE), and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>Fatigue</z:mp> Severity Scale (FSS-5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In total, 428 IBD patients had evaluable questionnaires (response rate 93%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall mean SOC total score was 66.25 (SD 11.47) and with no statistically significant difference between patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analyses, higher GSE scores were significantly associated with higher SOC scores and higher FSS-5 scores were significantly associated with lower SOC scores in both UC and CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>GSE and FSS-5 contributed more to the variance in SOC than sociodemographic and disease-related variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal studies are warranted to investigate the value of SOC as a predictor of disability, medication adherence, coping behavior, and health-related quality of life </plain></SENT>
