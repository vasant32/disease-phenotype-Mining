<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients receiving IFX for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in a single centre were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were extracted from clinical records in order to assess response to IFX therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was colectomy-free survival, and secondary outcomes included glucocorticosteroid-free remission and safety, which was evaluated by recording <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic and clinical characteristics of those who underwent colectomy and those who were colectomy-free, both at discharge from their index admission, and during follow-up after an initial response to IFX were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-four patients (16 females, mean age 36 years) received IFX between May 2006 and January 2012 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median duration of follow-up post-first infusion was 396 d (interquartile range = 173-828 d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 21 (47.7%) patients with &lt; 1 year of follow-up, 10 (22.7%) with 1 years to 2 years of follow-up, and 13 (29.5%) with &gt; 2 years of follow-up post-first infusion of IFX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, 35 (79.5%) responded to IFX, avoiding colectomy during their index admission, 29 (65.9%) were colectomy-free at last point of follow-up (median follow-up 396 d), and 25 (56.8%) were in glucocorticosteroid-free remission at end of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from post-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, 20 d after a single IFX infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Colectomy rates were generally lower among those "bridging" to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of 18 patients "bridged" to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> therapy, 17 (94.4%) were colectomy-free, and 15 (83.3%) were in glucocorticosteroid-free remission at study end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No predictors of response were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IFX is effective for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in real-life clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Two-thirds of patients avoided colectomy, and more than 50% were in glucocorticosteroid-free remission </plain></SENT>
