<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> seems to be an important mechanism for translocation to the cell surface of a variety of intracellular components capable of inducing autoantibody production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To identify the cellular location of antigen (Ag)-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi>) in non-apoptotic human neutrophils, and to assess if <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> reacts with neutrophil antigen(s) during neutrophil <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cellular distribution of Ag-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> in apoptotic neutrophils was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sera from 18 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients known to be positive for perinuclear IgG-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> (titre &gt; or =1/320), as assessed by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF), were analysed by immunofluorescent confocal laser scanning microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> were identified with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">fluorescein isothiocyanate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52282">tetramethylrhodamine</z:chebi> isothiocyanate (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52336">TRITC</z:chebi>) in non-apoptotic and apoptotic neutrophils, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic and non-apoptotic DNA was labelled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">Cycloheximide</z:chebi> was added to polymorphonuclear leucocyte culture to induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three patterns of scanning laser immunofluorescence microscopy in non-apoptotic neutrophils were observed with respect to cellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> associated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> distribution: (1) diffuse nuclear localisation (16.7%); (2) nuclear localisation in the nuclear periphery (50%); and (3) mixed nuclear and cytoplasmic localisation (33.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sera <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> fluorescence colocalised almost completely with apoptotic DNA, with persistence of a diffuse and intense fluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> titres were found in non-apoptotic neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The antigen(s) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> seems to be localised in most cases in the neutrophil nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The almost identical colocalisation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> and apoptotic cleaved DNA suggests that intracellular DNA redistribution during neutrophil <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> may play a role in antigen exposure to the immune system and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> production in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
