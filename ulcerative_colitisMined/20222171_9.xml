<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Publications addressing the relationship between rs2241880/T300A polymorphism of ATG16L1 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) were selected from the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To make direct comparisons between the data collected in these studies, the individual authors were contacted when necessary to generate a standardized set of data from these studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From these data, odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-five studies of CD were analyzed, 14 of which involved cases of UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The variant G allele of ATG16L1 was positively associated with CD (OR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.26-1.39, P &lt; 0.00001) and UC (OR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01-1.10, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For child-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> IBD, a higher G allele frequency was found for cases of CD (OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.16-1.57, P = 0.0001) than for cases of UC (OR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.81-1.19, P = 0.84) relative to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The ATG16L1 T300A polymorphism contributes to susceptibility to CD and UC in adults, but different in children, which implicates a role for autophagy in the pathogenesis of IBD </plain></SENT>
