<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>Iron-deficiency anemia</z:hpo> is described to be a common problem in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD), which is frequently associated with a reduced quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> in a population-based cohort at time of first diagnosis and during the early course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As far as available, lab values of patients registered in the population-based "Oberpfalz cohort" were screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In anemic patients, we further investigated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> laboratory results to differentiate between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e> and other reasons for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with any kind of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> were interviewed separately according to symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron-deficiency anemia</z:hpo> and administration of iron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In total, we evaluated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> values of 279 patients (183 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 90 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and 6 indeterminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lab data which allowed further differentiation of the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> were available in 70% of anemic patients, in 34.4% values of iron, ferritin and transferrin saturation had been measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At time of first diagnosis, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron-deficiency anemia</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 26 of 68 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (38.2%, 20 CD, 4 UC, and 2 IC patients), but only 9 patients (34.6%) received subsequent iron therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After one year, 27 patients were identified to have an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron-deficiency anemia</z:hpo> (19 CD, 8 UC), 20 of them were treated with iron (71.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of 9 patients with proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron-deficiency anemia</z:hpo> at time of first diagnosis and subsequent administration of iron, 5 (55.5%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron-deficiency anemia</z:hpo> despite permanent treatment after one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In total, 38 patients (54.3%) did not receive any iron substitution at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> despite of proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron-deficiency anemia</z:hpo>, and only 13 patients of 74 patients were treated with intravenous iron (17.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We found a high prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron-deficiency anemia</z:hpo> at different points during the early course of disease in this population-based cohort of IBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, only in one-third of patients with proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, further diagnostic approach was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Even patients with diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron-deficiency anemia</z:hpo> were infrequently and inconsequently treated with iron preparations, despite the high impact on quality of life </plain></SENT>
