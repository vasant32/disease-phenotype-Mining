<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The strong clinical association between primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> (PSC) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) suggests common factors in their pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Smoking, previous appendectomy, and tonsillectomy have been associated with a decreased risk of developing UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, our aim was to examine these risk factors in patients with PSC with and without underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The smoking habits and history of previous appendectomy and/or tonsillectomy of 170 patients with PSC, 41 without underlying IBD, 170 patients with UC but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> liver function tests, and 170 age and sex matched community controls were obtained by questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 112 PSC patients (66%) had never smoked compared with 66 controls (39%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only 12 PSC patients (7%) were current smokers versus 43 controls (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The resultant odds ratio of having PSC was 0.17 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08-0.35) among current smokers and 0.33 (95% CI 0.21-0.52) among ever (former+current) smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among former smokers, the odds of having PSC were also significantly decreased (odds ratio 0.45, 95% CI 0.26-0.73; p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup of PSC patients without IBD, only 5% were current smokers versus 26% of matched controls, and never smokers were overrepresented (68% v 37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of previous appendectomy was similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three study groups (14%, 12%, and 13%) but the frequency of tonsillectomy was reduced in the PSC group (21% v 31%; p=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PSC, like UC, is a disease of non-smokers as the odds of having PSC was significantly decreased among current and former smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The association between non-smoking and PSC was independent of whether the PSC patient had underlying IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Previous tonsillectomy but not appendectomy may also be associated with a decreased risk of PSC but this warrants further study </plain></SENT>
