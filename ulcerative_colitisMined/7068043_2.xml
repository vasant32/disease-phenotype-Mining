<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been shown to have similar potency to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> as an inhibitor of human neutrophil and monocyte motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hydroxychloroquine has then been compared with placebo in the prevention of an immune-complex experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rectal biopsies were taken from rabbits 24 hours after initiation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, coded, and graded histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The summated gradings for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and goblet cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> had worsened more in the control rabbits (mean grade +6.7) than in the treated rabbits (mean grade +1.8) P less than 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the mononuclear cell infiltrate between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hydroxychloroquine, which is a potent inhibitor of leucocyte motility, effectively prevents the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> inflammatory infiltrate in this experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> model and therefore merits trial in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
