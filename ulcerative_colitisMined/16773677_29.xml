<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consistent evidence of linkage to IBD3 (6p21.1-23), an area which encompasses the HLA complex, has been demonstrated for both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and a number of replicated associations with disease susceptibility and phenotype have recently emerged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, despite these efforts the HLA susceptibility gene (s) for IBD remain elusive, a consequence of strong linkage disequilibrium, extensive polymorphism and high gene density across this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This article reviews current knowledge of the role of HLA complex genes in IBD susceptibility and phenotype, and discusses the factors currently limiting the translation of this knowledge to clinical practice </plain></SENT>
