<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Bacteria are implicated in certain forms of model <z:hpo ids='HP_0100281'>chronic colitis</z:hpo> but the identity and role of bacteria in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) are uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To isolate pathogenic bacteria from inflamed mucosa of patients with UC, to examine whether the bacteria have a toxin to Vero cells, and to determine whether the toxin induces UC-like lesions in animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Bacteria were isolated from UC patients and supernatants from cultures were filtered and tested for cytotoxicity to Vero cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>Bacterial</z:mp> cells producing the cytotoxic supernatants were examined by polymerase chain reaction for verotoxin genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Culture supernatants of cytotoxic strains were examined by high performance liquid chromatography for organic acid concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mice were given enemas containing organic acid at the mean concentration in the supernatants of cytotoxic strains to ascertain whether colonic lesions appear in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only supernatants from cultures of Fusobacterium varium killed Vero cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>Bacterial</z:mp> cells lacked verotoxin genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>Bacterial</z:mp> culture supernatants contained high concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30772">n-butyric acid</z:chebi> and the mean concentration (32 mmol/l) was cytotoxic to Vero cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty four hours after mice were given enemas containing either <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30772">butyric acid</z:chebi> or F varium culture supernatants, colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> with <z:mp ids='MP_0000491'>crypt abscesses</z:mp>, inflammatory cell infiltration, and apoptotic changes were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30772">Butyric acid</z:chebi> in culture supernatants from cultures of F varium caused UC-like lesions in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study indicates that F varium may be one of the elusive pathogenic factors in UC </plain></SENT>
