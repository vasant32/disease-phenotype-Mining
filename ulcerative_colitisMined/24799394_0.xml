<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most risk variants affect regulation of transcription, but a critical challenge is to identify which genes and which cell types these variants affect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to characterise whole transcriptomes for each common T lymphocyte subset resident within the gut mucosa, and use these to infer biological insights and highlight candidate genes of interest within GWAS risk loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We isolated the four major intestinal T cell populations from pinch biopsies from healthy subjects and generated transcriptomes for each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We computationally integrated these transcriptomes with GWAS data from immune-related diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Robust, high quality transcriptomic data were generated from 1 ng of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from precisely sorted cell subsets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gene expression patterns clearly differentiated intestinal T cells from counterparts in peripheral blood and revealed distinct signalling pathways for each intestinal T cell subset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intestinal-specific T cell transcripts were enriched in GWAS risk loci for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coeliac disease</z:e>, but also specific extraintestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_194'>immune-mediated diseases</z:mpath>, allowing prediction of novel candidate genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of transcriptomes for minimally manipulated intestinal T lymphocyte subsets in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that careful processing of mucosal biopsies allows the generation of transcriptomes from as few as 1000 highly purified cells with minimal interindividual variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bioinformatic integration of transcriptomic data with recent GWAS data identified specific candidate genes and cell types for inflammatory pathologies </plain></SENT>
