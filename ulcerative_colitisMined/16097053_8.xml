<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the frequency and distribution of N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>)-glucuronosyltransferase 1A7 (UGT1A7) genes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Frequencies and distributions of NAT2 and UGT1A7 SNPs as well as their haplotypes were investigated in 95 patients with UC, 60 patients with CD, and 200 gender-matched, unrelated, healthy, control volunteers by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), PCR-denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), and direct DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the frequency of haplotype, NAT2*7B, significantly increased in CD patients, compared to that in controls (P = 0.0130, OR = 2.802, 95%CI = 1.243-6.316) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, there was no association between NAT2 haplotypes and UC, or between any UGT1A7 haplotypes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is likely that the NAT2 gene is one of the determinants for CD in Japanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, a new CD determinant may exist in the 8p22 region, where NAT2 is located </plain></SENT>
