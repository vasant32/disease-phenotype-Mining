<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To analyse the impact of NOD2/CARD15 mutations on the clinical course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients from an eastern European country (Hungary) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated the prevalence of the three common NOD2/CARD15 mutations (Arg702Trp, Gly908Arg, 1007finsC) in 148 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 128 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 208 controls recruited from the University of Szeged, Hungary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, the prevalence of NOD2/CARD15 mutations was correlated to the demographical and clinical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 32.4% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients carried at least one mutant allele within NOD2/CARD15 compared to 13.2% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (P = 0.0002) and to 11.5% of controls (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients, the allele frequencies for Arg702Trp, Gly908Arg and 1007finsC were 7.1%, 3.0% and 10.8% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, only the 1007finsC mutation was associated with a distinct clinical phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients positive for the 1007finsC mutation suffered more frequently from stenotic disease behaviour (P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 51.9% of patients positive for the 1007finsC mutation underwent a surgical resection within the ileum compared to only 17.4% of patients without the 1007finsC mutation (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With respect to the other two mutations (Arg702Trp and Gly908Arg), no associations were found with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> investigated clinical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NOD2/CARD15 mutations are frequently found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients from Hungary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 1007finsC mutation is associated with stenotic disease behaviour and frequent ileal resections </plain></SENT>
