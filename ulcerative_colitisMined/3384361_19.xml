<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Resting motor activity was significantly decreased in patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> compared with quiescent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (p less than 0.005) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty per cent of active colitics showed a featureless record compared with only one patient with quiescent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The volume of saline infused before leakage occurred, and the total volume retained were significantly lower (p less than 0.001) in patients with active and quiescent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rectal infusion of saline provoked regular rectal contractions, of significantly higher (p less than 0.05) amplitude in patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, than in quiescent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> or controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These rectal contractions were associated with simultaneous anal relaxations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During saline infusion, peak and pressures were lower in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, but there were no significant differences in relaxation pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, the rectal pressures remained below the anal pressures throughout the saline infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Peak rectal pressures exceeded the anal relaxation pressures during the last five minutes of saline infusion in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and throughout the infusion in those patients who complained of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">incontinence</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that although the resting rectal motor activity is diminished in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> distension causes the inflamed rectum to generate abnormally strong contractions that may threaten continence </plain></SENT>
