<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To identify the role of anti-pancreatic antibody (PAB) in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> (IBD) among Turkish patients, and its frequency in first-degree relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PAB and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ASCA) were examined in serum samples of 214 subjects including patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD, n = 64), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC, n = 63), first-degree relatives of patients with CD (n = 25), first-degree relatives of patients with UC (n = 28),and a control group with gastrointestinal symptoms other than (IBD) (n = 34) by indirect immunofluorescence Positivity of PAB and ASCA was compared in terms of Vienna classification, disease activity and medications used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In terms of PAB positivity, no difference was found between patients with CD (14.1%) and UC (7.9%) however, significant difference was observed between patients with CD and subjects in the control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No difference was found between patients with CD and their relatives in terms of ASCA positivity, whereas a significant difference was found between other groups (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared to ASCA, the sensitivity of the PAB was 19% (7/37), its specificity was 93% (25/27), positive predictive value was 77% (7/9) and negative predictive value was 45% (25/55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ASCA was found with significantly higher prevalence in patients with CD activity index &gt; 150 (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PAB is valuable in the diagnosis of IBD rather than CD, but cannot be used alone for diagnostic purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PAB is not superior to ASCA in CD diagnosis and in detecting CD among relatives of patients with CD </plain></SENT>
