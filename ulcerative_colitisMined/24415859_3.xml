<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their etiologies are unknown, but they are characterised by an imbalanced production of pro-<z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp>, e.g., <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-α, as well as increased recruitment of leukocytes to the site of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Advantages in understanding the role of the inflammatory pathways in IBD and an inadequate response to conventional therapy in a large portion of patients, has over the last two decades lead to new therapies which includes the TNF inhibitors (TNFi), designed to target and neutralise the effect of TNF-α </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TNFi have shown to be efficient in treating moderate to severe CD and UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, convenient alternative therapeutics targeting other immune pathways are needed for patients with IBD refractory to conventional therapy including TNFi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indeed, several therapeutics are currently under development, and have shown success in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These include antibodies targeting and neutralising interleukin-12/23, small pharmacologic Janus kinase inhibitors designed to block intracellular signaling of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, antibodies targeting integrins, and small anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules that block <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> between leukocytes and the intestinal vascular endothelium, reducing their infiltration into the inflamed mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this review we have elucidated the major signaling pathways of clinical importance for IBD therapy and highlighted the new promising therapies available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As stated in this paper several new treatment options are under development for the treatment of CD and UC, however, no drug fits <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hence, optimisations of treatment regimens are warranted for the benefit of the patients either through biomarker establishment or other rationales to maximise the effect of the broad range of mode-of-actions of the present and future drugs in IBD </plain></SENT>
