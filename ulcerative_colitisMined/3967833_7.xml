<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Complement was studied in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> probands with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and in their first degree relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Controls included 24 healthy volunteers and 24 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subnormal generation of chemotactic activity by the alternative pathway was shown in eight of 21 probands and in six of 33 relatives, a frequency in both groups significantly different from controls (p less than 0.005), with a strong connection between findings in patients and relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As previously shown in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, the subnormal generation was related to decreased utilisation of complement C3 in relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Raised levels of circulating complement C3c split products suggested complement involvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> probands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, plasma C3c was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> relatives, and none of the six cases with <z:mp ids='MP_0002468'>complement dysfunction</z:mp> had gastrointestinal symptoms or a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest, that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272241" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">complement abnormality</z:e> seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients does not simply reflect mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> or hypercatabolism of complement </plain></SENT>
