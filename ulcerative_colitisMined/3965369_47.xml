<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prevalences of <z:chebi fb="158" ids="16183">methane</z:chebi> excretion were 54% in healthy controls, 53% in non-gastrointestinal patients and 32% in gastrointestinal patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032266" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis</z:e> had significantly lower prevalences of <z:chebi fb="158" ids="16183">methane</z:chebi> excretion (13%, 15%, and 11% respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Faecal constituents and in vitro incubation analysis were similar in breath <z:chebi fb="158" ids="16183">methane</z:chebi> excretors and non-excretors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several patients did not excrete <z:chebi fb="158" ids="16183">methane</z:chebi> in the breath although <z:chebi fb="158" ids="16183">methane</z:chebi> was present in colonic gas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that different gastrointestinal patient groups have different prevalences of breath <z:chebi fb="158" ids="16183">methane</z:chebi> excretion and that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> healthy subjects may produce <z:chebi fb="158" ids="16183">methane</z:chebi> but only when the production reaches a threshold does it appear in the breath </plain></SENT>
