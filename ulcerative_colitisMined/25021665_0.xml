<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this project were to a) characterise the clinical features of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> and b) identify clinical useful genetic markers that might predict development of this serious adverse drug reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were identified and recruited from 172 sites (128 UK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria included a) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> within three months of starting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> treatment b) ≥ two-fold rise in amylase or lipase c) medical opinion implicating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> therapy and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">drug withdrawal</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We recruited 303 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following adjudication 48 cases classified as definite (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100027'>recurrent pancreatitis</z:hpo> on rechallenge) and 195 cases classified as probable (temporal relationship and no other cause for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo>) were taken forward for analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>46% of patients were smokers at the time of development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> for a median of 19 days (95% CI: 17 - 21) before development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most cases were mild, with only 5 cases developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0349410" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">single organ dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>70% of patients were hospitalised with a median length of stay of 4 days (95% CI: 3.2 - 4.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neither age (p = 0.08), drug dose (p = 0.11), BMI (p = 0.73) nor smoking (p = 0.59) predicted length of hospital stay or severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Using a control cohort of 4,109 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> cases we conducted a genome wide association study with these 239 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A significant variant was identified in the Class II MHC region (Odds ratio 3.03, p = 2.63 × 10-20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Dedicated HLA and 1000 genome project imputation refined the association within the MHC (R squared &gt; 0.8 and MAF &gt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This association was robust to principle component correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>TPMT genotype was not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> development (p = 0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A second cohort of 100 cases and 500 independent disease controls treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi> but screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> has been generated to confirm the association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We describe the largest clinical characterisation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> to date and use this cohort to undertake a pharmacogenetics genome wide association study that has identified a significant association within the Class II MHC region </plain></SENT>
