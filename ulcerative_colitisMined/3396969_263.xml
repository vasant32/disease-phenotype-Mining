<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>By running the Swedish twin registry containing about 25,000 pairs of twins of the same sex together with the central national diagnosis register of hospital inpatients, 80 twin pairs suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> group one of 16 monozygotic pairs was concordant for the disease, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the other 20 pairs (dizygotic or unknown zygosity) were discordant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> group eight of 18 monozygotic pairs and one of 26 dizygotic pairs were concordant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proband concordance rate among monozygotic twins was 6.3% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 58.3% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The calculated heritability of liability based on monozygotic pairs was 0.53 and 1.0 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus heredity as an aetiological factor is stronger in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Monozygotic twins with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> were more likely to be smokers than monozygotic twins with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Smoking did not explain the discordance of twin pairs with either <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combination of identical heredity and similar smoking habit is not sufficient to cause disease </plain></SENT>
