<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based on the 5' region of IS900 and capable of the specific detection of a single M <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paratuberculosis</z:e> genome was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was applied to DNA extracts of full thickness samples of intestine removed at surgery from 40 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 23 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and 40 control patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>M <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paratuberculosis</z:e> was identified in 26 of 40 (65%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, in 1 of 23 (4.3%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and in 5 of 40 (12.5%) control tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Positive samples from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> were from both the small intestine and colon, those from control tissues were from the colon those from control tissues were from the colon only </plain></SENT>
