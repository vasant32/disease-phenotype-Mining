<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> specimens showed histological evidence of premalignant change and these changes were reflected at the ultrastructural level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No electron microscopical premalignant changes were found which could not more easily be detected by simple histology, and it is concluded that attempts to detect premalignant changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> using electron microscopical techniques are likely to be unrewarding </plain></SENT>
