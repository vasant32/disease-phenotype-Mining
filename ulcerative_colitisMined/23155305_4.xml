<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is also evidence that the pathologic process is due to defects in counter-regulatory mechanisms, such as those involving the immunosuppressive cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indeed, studies in human IBD tissues and murine models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> have documented a disruption of TGF-β1 signalling marked by a block in the phosphorylation of Smad3, a signalling molecule associated with the activated TGF-β receptor, due to up-regulation of Smad7, an intracellular inhibitor of Smad3 phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Knock-down of Smad7 with a specific antisense oligonucleotide restores TGF-β1/Smad3 signalling, thus resulting in a marked suppression of inflammatory cytokine production and attenuation of murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings together with the demonstration that Smad7 antisense oligonucleotide is not toxic when administered in mice have paved the way for the development of a Smad7 antisense oligonucleotide-based pharmaceutical compound that is now ready to enter the clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this article we review the available data supporting the pathogenic role of Smad7 in IBD and discuss whether and how Smad7 antisense therapy could help dampen the ongoing <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in IBD </plain></SENT>
