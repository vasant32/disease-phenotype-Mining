<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The number of patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age brackets diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Inflammatory Bowel Disease</z:e> (IBD) has risen dramatically worldwide over the past 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IBD's changing epidemiology suggests that environmental factors play a major role in modifying disease expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aim </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To review studies carried out worldwide analyzing IBD epidemiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A Medline search indicating as keywords "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Inflammatory Bowel Disease</z:e>," "epidemiology," "natural history," "<z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's Disease</z:hpo>," "<z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative Colitis</z:hpo>," and "IBD Unclassified" was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A selection of clinical cohort and systematic review studies that were carried out between 2002 and 2013 was reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Studies referring to an earlier date were also considered whenever the data were relevant to our review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The current mean prevalence of IBD in the total population of Western countries is estimated at 1/1,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The highest prevalence and incidence rates of IBD worldwide are reported from Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Just as urbanization and socioeconomic development, the incidence of IBD is rising in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Multicenter national registers and international networks can provide information on IBD epidemiology and lead to hypotheses about its causes and possible management strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The rising trend in the disease's incidence in developing nations suggests that its epidemiological evolution is linked to industrialization and modern Westernized lifestyles </plain></SENT>
