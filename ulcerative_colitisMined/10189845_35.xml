<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the cytokine/soluble receptor role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To test the hypothesis that an imbalance in secretion between TNF and TNF inhibitors plays a role in gut <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The secretion of TNF-alpha, TNF-beta, and soluble TNF receptors was compared in the culture supernatants of colonic biopsy specimens and isolated lamina propria mononuclear cells from patients with active colonic IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Spontaneous secretion of TNF-alpha in involved IBD mucosa was higher than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control and self limited <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secretion of TNF-beta was higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> than in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Soluble TNF receptor in IBD mucosa inhibited TNF activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Type 2 soluble receptor release from IBD mucosa was increased in active <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>; release from lamina propria cells was not increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mucosal TNF-alpha production correlated with severity of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results showed enhanced secretion of TNF-alpha but failure to release enhanced amounts of soluble TNF receptor in lamina propria mononuclear cells of patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An imbalance in secretion between TNF and TNF inhibitor may be implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD </plain></SENT>
