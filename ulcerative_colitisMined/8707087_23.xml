<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It has been shown that MUC2 is the prominent mucin synthesised in healthy colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To identify the predominant mucins in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and to study their biosynthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Mucin was purified from UC resection specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This mucin on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecylsulphate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE) presented as one, high molecular weight, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi>/Schiff's reagent (<z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>) stainable band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Amino acid composition showed a close resemblance to that of MUC2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation with a specific anti-MUC2 antiserum confirmed that this mucin was MUC2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, on the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level MUC2 was also the most prominent mucin expressed in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Polyclonal antiserum was elicited, mainly recognising mucin <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> of UC and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Biosynthetic studies with [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>]amino acids showed that the MUC2-precursor in UC displayed a molecular mass on <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE of approximately 600 kDa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This precursor was converted into a mature MUC2 with anomalous mobility on <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE of 550 kDa and was secreted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only this 550 kDa band could be labelled with [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> and stained by <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that in parallel with the mucin expression in healthy controls, MUC2 is the major mucin expressed in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Qualitatively, MUC2 biosynthesis seems unchanged in UC </plain></SENT>
