<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He had a four-year history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic findings revealed that a protruded lesion with an approximate size of 3 cm at the splenic flexure was surrounded by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudopolyps</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lifting of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was poor despite injection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline around it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the combination of endoscopic resection and heat ablation therapy with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histopathological examination of the resected specimen showed tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> with high-grade atypia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic examination 15 months after this treatment revealed no occurrence of ALM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whether or not there is a possibility of local recurrence after ablation therapy in addition to endoscopic resection performed in this case remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, this endoscopic therapy is a promising option for ALM in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
