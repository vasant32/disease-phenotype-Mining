<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We amplified and sequenced the complete exon 17 of the human gp130 gene in 146 patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to clinical and histopathological signs, the 146 patients with IBD were classified as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (n = 73) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (n = 63), or as indeterminate status (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No mutations in exon 17 of the gp130 gene could be detected in any of the 146 patients with IBD examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is no evidence that mutations in exon 17 of the gp130 gene are involved in the pathogenesis of human IBD </plain></SENT>
