<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>E coli isolated from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> possess a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> resistant adhesin similar to that found in pathogenic E coli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study 42 E coli isolates from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> have been compared with 15 from controls to assess hydrophobicity and cellular adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The salting out method and the buccal epithelial cell technique were used respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>E coli isolated from colitics are significantly more hydrophobic than control E coli (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The salting out score correlates negatively with the buccal epithelial cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When E coli are grown at 18 degrees C both properties are temporarily reduced suggesting that they are related to each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The salting out method clearly differentiates between E coli isolated from colitics and controls, and offers a simple method of detecting adhesive E coli in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
