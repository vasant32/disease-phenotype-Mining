<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We followed a population based cohort of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) from Olmsted County, Minnesota, in order to analyse long term survival and cause specific mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Material and METHODS: A total of 692 patients were followed for a median of 14 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs, observed/expected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>) were calculated for specific causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards regression was used to determine if clinical variables were independently associated with mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty six of 314 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients died compared with 46.0 expected (SMR 1.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9-1.6)), and 62 of 378 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) patients died compared with 79.2 expected (SMR 0.8 (95% CI 0.6-1.0)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (32%) died from disease related complications, and 12 patients (19%) died from causes related to UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, an increased risk of dying from non-malignant gastrointestinal causes (SMR 6.4 (95% CI 3.2-11.5)), gastrointestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> (SMR 4.7 (95% CI 1.7-10.2)), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> (COPD) (SMR 3.5 (95% CI 1.3-7.5)) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In UC, cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was reduced (SMR 0.6 (95% CI 0.4-0.9)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased age at diagnosis and male sex were associated with mortality in both subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In UC but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, a diagnosis after 1980 was associated with decreased mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this population based study of IBD patients from North America, overall survival was similar to that expected in the US White population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients were at increased risk of dying from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disease</z:e> and COPD whereas UC patients had a decreased risk of cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
