<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serologic and genetic markers have shown great potential for clinical application in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), particularly for prognostication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, their use is not as well established in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this paper is to highlight the clinical relevance of these markers for diagnostics and prognostication in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review identified studies that cited the use of serum and genetic biomarkers in UC when these biomarkers were used in diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic response prediction applications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several serologic and genetic markers associated with UC were identified, and this review presents and summarizes these data, focusing on the biomarkers' established and emerging diagnostic and prognostic utility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although more established in CD, the data provided by serologic and genetic testing in UC has the potential to enhance clinical decision making </plain></SENT>
