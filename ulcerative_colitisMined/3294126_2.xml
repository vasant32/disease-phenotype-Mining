<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that a hyperplastic lymph node response in nu/nu mice occurred with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), or other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OID</z:e>) tissue inoculations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, antigen transmission to lymph nodes as detected by indirect immunofluorescence using CD sera was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> inoculation groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The immunofluorescent reaction also occurred independently of lymph node histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, we confirm that CD sera recognize an antigen(s) expressed in lymph nodes of athymic mice inoculated with CD tissue filtrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The antibody (or antibodies) in CD sera was not specific for this 'CD antigen or antigens', however, as tested in the nu/nu mouse system, because the CD sera antibodies also recognised antigens in UC inoculated and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OID</z:e> inoculated animals </plain></SENT>
