<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Goblet cell glycoconjugate structure was examined in the rectal biopsies using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> conjugated lectins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the beginning of the study, 13 of the 18 patients had abnormalities of goblet cell mucin or cytoplasmic glycoconjugates in the rectal biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> subsequently developed in six and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in one of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the five patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lectin binding studies in the initial rectal biopsies, colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> has subsequently developed in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The abnormalities seen in the rectal goblet cells resembled in part those previously seen in immature and neoplastic colonic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The dysplastic tissues <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> contained the form of mucin which has been found in other neoplastic colonic tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This preliminary report after four years of prospective study suggests that abnormalities of glycoconjugate structure may be associated with, and may precede, neoplastic events in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
