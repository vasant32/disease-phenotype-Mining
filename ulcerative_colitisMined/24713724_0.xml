<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) is present in some <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the familial occurrence of UC and its impact on disease severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A structured questionnaire was distributed to patients with UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Parameters pertaining to disease severity were compared for patients with or without positive family history of IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study group consisted of 168 UC patients with a total of 952 first degree relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Positive family history for IBD in a first degree relative was reported in 24 patients (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six of the 336 parents (1.8%) had IBD (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 13 siblings with IBD (4 CD, 9 UC) out of 249 (5.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven of 376 (1.9%) offsprings had IBD (4 CD, 3 UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Familial patients were more commonly females and have reported significantly more disease exacerbations than the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> group (17.7±15 versus 6.8±11, respectively, p=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277558" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">familial disease</z:e> was significantly and independently associated with both female sex (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.1-14.9, p=0.04) and more exacerbations per year (annual OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.1, p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, similar proportions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and familial patients wherever hospitalized, underwent colectomy or were treated by immune-suppressors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Familial occurrence of UC is not uncommon among Jewish patients in Israel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The familial-genetic component may preferentially influence disease occurrence among females, and is possibly associated with more disease flares although other parameters of disease severity do not seem to be impacted </plain></SENT>
