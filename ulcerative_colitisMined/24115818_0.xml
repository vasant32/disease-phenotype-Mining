<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study serological antibodies in Caucasians and Asians, in health and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD), in Australia and Hong Kong (HK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Anti-glycan antibodies [anti-chitobioside (ACCA), anti-laminaribioside (ALCA)], and anti-mannobioside (AMCA), anti-Saccharomyces cervisiae (gASCA); and atypical perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA) were tested in IBD patients, their unaffected relatives, and healthy controls in Australia and HK (China) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antibody status (positive or negative) and titre was compared between subjects of different geography, ethnicity and disease state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety subjects were evaluated: 21 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), 32 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), 29 healthy controls, and 8 IBD patient relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty eight subjects were Australian (29 Caucasian and 19 ethnic Han Chinese) and 42 were from HK (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Han Chinese) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Caucasian CD patients had a significantly higher antibody prevalence of gASCA (67% vs 3%, P &lt; 0.001), ALCA (44% vs 6%, P = 0.005), and AMCA (67% vs 15%, P = 0.002), whereas HK CD patients had a higher prevalence of only AMCA (58% vs 25%, P = 0.035), when compared with UC and healthy subjects in both countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Caucasian CD had significantly higher gASCA prevalence (67% vs 0%, P &lt; 0.001) and titre (median 59 vs 9, P = 0.002) than HK CD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prevalence and titres of ALCA, ACCA and AMCA did not differ between CD in the two countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Presence of at least one antibody was higher in Caucasian than HK CD patients (100% vs 58%, P = 0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>pANCA did not differ between countries or ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Serologic CD responses differ between HK Asian and Australian Caucasian patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Different genetic, environmental or disease pathogenic factors may account for these differences </plain></SENT>
