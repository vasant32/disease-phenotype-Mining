<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is a highly effective, safe, and well-tolerated drug for treatment of mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, which represents most patients with this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies of patient adherence to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> therapies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> have highlighted the need for regimens that enable long-term compliance to significantly reduce the risk of troublesome and debilitating flares in the short term, and possibly <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in the long term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indeed, much of the recent innovation in clinical use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> has come from studies of novel delivery mechanisms and simplified oral dosing schedules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These studies have provided much needed clarity on essential matters such as starting dose, dose escalation, and efficacy in terms of the ideal clinical endpoint - mucosal healing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Various manufacturers are re-evaluating their products to determine the safety and efficacy of such dosing regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although once widely employed in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), the accumulated body of evidence now suggests that there is a much more limited role for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> in this particular form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> randomized-controlled trials, comparative studies, and outcomes research have led to refined treatment strategies and awareness for practitioners to better inform, engage and facilitate patients in optimal use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
