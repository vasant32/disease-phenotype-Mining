<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A characteristic feature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) is mesenteric adipose tissue <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mesenteric adipocytes or specific proteins secreted by them may play a role in the pathogenesis of CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recently identified adiponectin as an adipocyte specific protein with anti-inflammatory properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we report on expression of adiponectin in mesenteric adipose tissue of CD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Mesenteric adipose tissue specimens were obtained from patients with CD (n = 22), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) (n = 8) and, for controls, colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients (n = 28) who underwent intestinal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin concentrations were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, and adiponectin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were determined by real time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tissue concentrations and release of adiponectin were significantly increased in hypertrophied mesenteric adipose tissue of CD patients compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mesenteric adipose tissue of CD patients (p = 0.002, p = 0.040, respectively), UC patients (p = 0.002, p = 0.003), and controls (p&lt;0.0001, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were significantly higher in hypertrophied mesenteric adipose tissue of CD patients than in paired <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mesenteric adipose tissue from the same subjects (p = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin concentrations in hypertrophied mesenteric adipose tissue of CD patients with an internal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> were significantly lower than those of CD patients without an internal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that adipocytes in hypertrophied mesenteric adipose tissue produce and secrete significant amounts of adiponectin, which could be involved in the regulation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> associated with CD </plain></SENT>
