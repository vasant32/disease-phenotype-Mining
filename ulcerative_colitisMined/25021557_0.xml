<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, IL-8 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-a, are elevated in the inflamed mucosa of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and play a central role in driving the pro-inflammatory immune response in this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TNF-a is cleaved from the cell surface by TNF-a converting enzyme (TACE), which is inhibited by tissue inhibitor of Metalloproteinase (TIMP)-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied whether the addition of TIMP-3 to inflamed colonic biopsies from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients reduced the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Colonic biopsies were obtained from macroscopically inflamed areas of 4 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> undergoing colonoscopy for a disease flare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were then cultured ex vivo for 24 h in 300 ul of serum free <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-1 medium in the absence or presence of recombinant human TIMP-3 (100 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concentration of TNF-a, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8 were measured in culture supernatants by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Culture with TIMP-3 significantly reduced TNF-a production by inflamed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> biopsies cultured ex vivo (from 1365 ug/ml in the absence of TIMP-3 to 45 ug/ml after TIMP-3 addition) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the addition of TIMP-3 significantly reduced IL-1b production by inflamed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> biopsies (from 776 to 261 ug/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a trend in the reduction of IL-6 (from 3018 to 2702 ug/ml), which did not reach statistic significance, and no significant change in IL-8 production (from 30812 to 29114.5 ug/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TIMP-3 administration not only causes a reduction in TNF-a via TACE inhibition but also IL-1β </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This raises the possibility of its use therapeutically in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DISCLOSURE OF INTEREST: None Declared </plain></SENT>
