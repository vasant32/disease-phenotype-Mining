<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>THE COLORECTAL MUCOSA INCLUDES TWO QUANTITATIVELY, STRUCTURALLY AND FUNCTIONALLY DISSIMILAR AREAS: one, built with columnar and goblet cells, covers the vast majority of the mucosa, and the other consists of scattered minute gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The overwhelming majority of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> evolve in GALT-free mucosal areas and very rarely in GALT aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, the colonic mucosa in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) displays a high number of newly formed GALT-aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient here described is a 68-year-old female with a history of UC since 1984 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At surveillance colonoscopy in 2012, one of two detected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> was a tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Beneath this <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, a well-circumscribed GALT sheltering a <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serial sections revealed no connection between the villous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and the GALT-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The GALT-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> here reported seems to have evolved in a newly formed, UC-dependent, GALT complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This notion is substantiated by the fact that 27% or 4 out of the 15 cases of GALT-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> in the colon reported in the literature (including the present case) evolved in patients with UC </plain></SENT>
