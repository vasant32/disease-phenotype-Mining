<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Many patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) have low bone mineral density (BMD) that may not be solely attributable to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that low BMD in patients with CD is associated with elevated circulating levels of the active form of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29191">(OH)</z:chebi>(2)D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We further hypothesised that this was secondary to increased synthesis of 1,25<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29191">(OH)</z:chebi>(2)D by inflammatory cells in the intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between 1,25<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29191">(OH)</z:chebi>(2)D levels and BMD in patients with CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An IRB approved retrospective review of medical records from patients with CD (n = 138) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC, n = 29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Measurements of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> metabolites and immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (iPTH) were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BMD results were available for 88 CD and 20 UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry or real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the enzyme 1alpha-hydroxylase was performed on colonic biopsies from patients with CD (14) or UC (12) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colons (4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Inappropriately high levels of serum 1,25<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29191">(OH)</z:chebi>(2)D (&gt;60 pg/ml) were observed in 42% of patients with CD compared with only 7% in UC, despite no differences in mean iPTH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serum 1,25<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29191">(OH)</z:chebi>(2)D levels were higher in CD (57 pg/ml) versus UC (41 pg/ml) (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with CD, there was a negative correlation between 1,25<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29191">(OH)</z:chebi>(2)D levels and lumbar BMD (r = -0.301, p = 0.005) independent of therapeutic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>1,25<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29191">(OH)</z:chebi>(2)D levels also correlated with CD activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Lastly, immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR demonstrated increased expression of intestinal 1alpha-hydroxylase in patients with CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that elevated 1,25<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29191">(OH)</z:chebi>(2)D is more common in CD than previously appreciated and is independently associated with low bone mineral density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The source of the active <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> may be the inflamed intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Treatment of the underlying <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> may improve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005944" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic bone disease</z:e> in this subgroup of patients </plain></SENT>
