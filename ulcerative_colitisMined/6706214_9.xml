<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, is still obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> aetiology has been proposed, based in part on reports that filtrates prepared from tissues of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> induce cytopathic effects in tissue culture cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our attempts to culture viruses in many cell lines from filtrates prepared from the tissue of 95 patients have been negative, except for one case in which cytomegalovirus was isolated from the tissue of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our studies confirm previous reports that intestinal tissue filtrates induce cytopathic effects in inoculated cell cultures, but the effect we observed is non-specific; cytopathic effects were induced in most cell lines tested and with similar frequency irrespective of whether the intestinal filtrates were prepared from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients, or non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy studies of tissue culture cells exhibiting cytopathic effects have not revealed virus particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Characterisation of the cytopathic effect inducing factor showed that it was incapable of serial passage in tissue culture, too small to be a conventional virus, resistant to inactivation by ultraviolet light, and heat stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the observed cytopathic effect was caused by a non-replicating cytotoxic factor, or factors, released from intestinal tissues of both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
