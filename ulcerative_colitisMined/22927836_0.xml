<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study effect and its mechanism of Bifid Triple Viable for initially treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>82 patients, who were firstly diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, were randomized into experiment group (41 cases, treated with Bifid Triple Viable and Etiasa) and control group (41 cases, treated with Etiasa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinic symptom score, colon mucosa <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> score, and some immune indices were detected and compared between two groups before and two months after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two months after treatment, the clinical symptom score, colon mucosa <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> score, and IL-1Î² expression in colon mucosa decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.01), and IL-10 and IgA expressions in colon mucosa increased significantly (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those differences were more marked in experiment group than control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, peripheral blood T cell subgroup, immunoglobulins, and complements had no significant difference between two groups two months after treatment, but the ratio of peripheral blood CD4+ T cell to CD8+ T cell in experiment group increased more than that in control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bifid Triple Viable contributed to Etiasa to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in inducing remission period, which was perhaps related to affecting the patient's immune function </plain></SENT>
