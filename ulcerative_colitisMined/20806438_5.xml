<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>(AL) in a murine model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: BALB/c mice were administered 100 mg/kg AL powder orally each day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 7 d, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> was induced by administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34674">dextran sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (DSS) (5% W/V) in drinking water for a further 8 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>Diarrhea</z:hpo> and bloody stools as well as colonic histology were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The level of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in colonic sections were detected by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were significant differences in mean body weight values and disease activity indices between controls and AL-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the histological findings showed that AL treatment can prevent mucosal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, submucosal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath>, ulceration, inflammatory cell infiltration and colon damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, immunohistochemistry analysis showed that the levels of the inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were also decreased in AL-treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We suggest that AL can prevent intestinal damage and decrease inflammatory cytokines in mice with DSS-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, AL could prove to be a useful food for UC </plain></SENT>
