<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To validate the clinical relevance of autofluorescence imaging (AFI) endoscopy for the assessment of inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 572 endoscopic images were selected from 42 UC patients: 286 taken with white light imaging (WLI) and 286 with AFI from the same sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>WLI images were assessed for overall mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> according to Mayo endoscopic subscore (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>), and for seven characteristic endoscopic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Likewise, AFI photographs were scored according to relative abundance of red, green and blue color components within each image based on an RGB additive color model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>WLI and AFI endoscopic scores from the same sites were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological evaluation of biopsies was according to the Riley Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Relative to red (r = 0.52, P &lt; 0.01) or blue (r = 0.56, P &lt; 0.01) color component, the green color component of AFI (r = -0.62, P &lt; 0.01) corresponded more closely with mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences in green color components between <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>-0 (0.396 ± 0.043) and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>-1 (0.340 ± 0.035) (P &lt; 0.01), and between <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>-1 and ≥ <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>-2 (0.318 ± 0.037) (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The WLI scores for "vascular patterns" (r = -0.65, P &lt; 0.01), "<z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>" (r = -0.62, P &lt; 0.01), histology scores for "polymorphonuclear cells in the lamina propria" (r = -0.51, P &lt; 0.01) and "crypt architectural irregularities" (r = -0.51, P &lt; 0.01) showed correlation with the green color component of AFI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences in green color components between limited (0.399 ± 0.042) and extensive (0.375 ± 0.044) (P = 0.014) polymorphonuclear cell infiltration within <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>-0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As the severity of the mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> increased, the green color component of AFI decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The AFI green color component was well correlated with the characteristic endoscopic and histological inflammatory features of UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: AFI has application in detecting inflammatory lesions, including microscopic activity in the colonic mucosa of UC patients, based on the green color component of images </plain></SENT>
