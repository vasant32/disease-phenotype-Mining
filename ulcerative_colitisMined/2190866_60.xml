<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>IgG serum antibody was measured by ELISA in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (15), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (15), and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (15) to 12 strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's and brewer's yeast) and to the two major serotypes of the commensal yeast Candida albicans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antibody to 11 of the 12 strains of S cerevisiae was raised in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> but not in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> when compared with controls (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pattern of antibody response to these 11 strains was variable, however, suggesting the likelihood of antigenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> within the species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antibody to C albicans was not significantly different in patient and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The specificity of this unusual antibody response in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> for S cerevisiae suggests that it is not simply the result of a generalised increase in intestinal permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, because brewing and baking strains detected the response, the relevant antigen(s) are presumably common in the diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hypersensitivity to dietary antigens may be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, and the role of S cerevisiae requires further investigation </plain></SENT>
