<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis, along with assessment of disease activity and prognosis present challenges to managing clinicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Faecal biomarkers, such as faecal calprotectin, are a non-invasive method which can be used to aid these decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Calprotectin is a calcium and zinc binding protein found in the cytosol of human neutrophils and macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is released extracellularly in times of cell stress or damage and can be detected within faeces and thus can be used as a sensitive marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Faecal calprotectin has been shown to be useful in the diagnosis of IBD, correlates with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mucosal disease</z:e> activity and can help to predict response to treatment or relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With growing evidence supporting its use, over the last decade this faecal biomarker has significantly changed the way IBD is managed </plain></SENT>
