<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: RTP1 (200 mg.kg(-1), i.g.) extracted from Rheum tanguticum Maxim. ex Regel was administrated to rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi> for 5 d, 7 d, 10 d and 14 d, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of RTP1 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (DX, 0.2 mg.kg(-1), i.g.) were contrastively investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The MPO level and SOD activity were determined by chromatometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expansion and protein expression of CD4+T lymphocytes isolated from colon mucosae and mesenteric lymph nodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> rats were performed by immunohistochemical analysis and Western-blot methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatments of RTP1 (200 mg.kg(-1), i.g.) significantly reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, mortality, colon mass, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> areas and MPO level in colon mucosae on days 5, 7, 10 and 14 (5.2+/-1.4, 5.4+/-0.7, 5.2+/-1.8, P&lt;0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3.4+/-0.8, P&lt;0.01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>16.1+/-12.1, P&lt;0.01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>31.8+/-8.6, 17.7+/-5.3, 12.7+/-4.1, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effects of RTP1 were similar to those noted above in DX group, but there were no immunosuppressive effects of DX in RTP(-1) group, such as body mass loss, thymus and <z:mp ids='MP_0003643'>spleen atrophy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The decreased number and down-regulated protein levels of CD4+T cells isolated from the colon of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> rats treated with RTP1 were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: RTP1 shows significantly protective effects but lower side effects on rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mechanism may be due to the resistance to over expansion of CD4 </plain></SENT>
