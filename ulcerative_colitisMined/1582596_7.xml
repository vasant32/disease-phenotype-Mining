<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous data suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> exacerbations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> can be distinguished by different IgG subclass expression of mucosal immunocytes and a different IgG subclass production pattern of lamina propria lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A procedure to obtain enough intestinal mononuclear cells from biopsy specimens to measure in vitro IgG and IgG1 production in control subjects and various patient groups has been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgG2 could be measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> only, as the concentrations in control subjects were below the sensitivity of the ELISA method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that IgG and IgG1 production correlated with the degree of local <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in both diseases, even in slightly inflamed mucosa, compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportion of IgG1 subclass was significantly increased in severely inflamed mucosa of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A major difference between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> mucosa is apparent in mild or no <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> mucosa in remission, the IgG1/IgG ratio is comparable with that in controls, yet <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> mucosa still displays significantly increased proportions of IgG1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the IgG2/IgG ratio is 0.12 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 0.19 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results show the dependence of local IgG and IgG1 production on the degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and that an increase in subclass IgG1 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> is present at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages, including remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings support the hypothesis that different immunoregulatory mechanisms are involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Environmental stimuli or genetic background may be responsible for the observed differences </plain></SENT>
