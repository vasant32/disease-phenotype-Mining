<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: A few studies have applied genomic-wide gene expression analysis in inflamed colon tissue sample in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reported the first study of non-inflamed mucosal gene expression in UC and explored its clinical implication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Non-inflamed mucosa was obtained from 6 UC patients who received total colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The gene expression of UC in noninflamed mucosa was monitored with a microarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For a selected gene, RT-PCR was performed to verify array results and to further examine expression pattern in inflamed mucosa of UC, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissue and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa using additional matched pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two genes showing 2.5-fold decreased expression with significance set at in UC samples were homeo box a4 (HOXa4) and mads box transcription enhancer factor 2, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> B (MEF2b) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR showed that MEF2b expression in non-inflamed mucosa was significantly downregulated, whereas the expression of MEF2b increased in accordance with the severity of mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HOXa4 expression both in inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa in UC was consistently downregulated, and the downregulation of HOXa4 was also found in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is suggested that the MEF2b expression in UC which increase in accordance with <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> may be induced by the inflammatory mediator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast the downregulation of HOXa4 may be partly involved in the pathogenesis of disease including UC and UC-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
