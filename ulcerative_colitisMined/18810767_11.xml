<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although systemic steroids are highly efficacious in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), failure to respond to steroids still poses an important challenge to the surgeon and physician alike </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Even if the life time risk of a fulminant UC flare is only 20%, this condition is potentially life threatening and should be managed in hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If patients fail 3 to 5 d of intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and optimal supportive care, they should be considered for any of three options: intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (2 mg/kg for 7 d, and serum level controlled), infliximab (5 mg/kg IV, 0-2-6 wk) or total colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The choice between these three options is a medical-surgical decision based on clinical signs, radiological and endoscopic findings and blood analysis (CRP, serum albumin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Between 65 and 85% of patients will initially respond to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and avoid colectomy on the short term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over 5 years only 50% of initial responders avoid colectomy and outcomes are better in patients naive to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> (bridging strategy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data on infliximab as a medical rescue in fulminant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> are more limited although the efficacy of this anti <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF) monoclonal antibody has been demonstrated in a controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Controlled data on the comparative efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and infliximab are not available at this moment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both drugs are <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> and are used in combination with steroids and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>, which infers a risk of serious, even fatal, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">opportunistic infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, patients not responding to these agents within 5-7 d should be considered for colectomy and responders should be closely monitored for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
