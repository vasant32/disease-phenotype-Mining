<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are also involved in local lymphocyte stimulation and antigen presentation within the intestinal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp>, many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules are upregulated, but alpha4-integrins most likely hold a key position in directing leukocytes into the inflamed bowel wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic compounds directed against trafficking of leukocytes have been designed and are being developed as a novel class of drugs in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review deals with the immunological aspects of leukocyte trafficking focused on gut homing of T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Second, the changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules and T cell trafficking during <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, we review the clinical data that have been gathered with respect to the therapeutic potential and the safety of antiadhesion molecule treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antegren, or natalizumab, a humanized anti-alpha4 integrin IgG4 antibody, has been most extensively evaluated and may be close to registration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A more specific humanized alpha4beta7-integrin MLN-02 has shown preliminary clinical efficacy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and both antergren and MLN-02 appear to be very safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Trials with the anti-ICAM-1 antisense oligonucleotide ISIS-2302 in steroid refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> have provided conflicting efficacy data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the near future, some of these novel biological agents may prove valuable therapeutic tools in the management of refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, although it is too early to define the patient population that will benefit most from these agents </plain></SENT>
