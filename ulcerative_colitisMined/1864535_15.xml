<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 41 sera from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, 'classical' anticolon antibody was present in 41% and was commoner in patients with sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxic anticolon antibody was present in 20% overall and was strongly associated with disease activity; it did not correlate with the presence of 'classical' anticolon antibody </plain></SENT>
