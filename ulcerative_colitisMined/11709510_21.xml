<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Linkage data have now identified several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) susceptibility loci but these data have not been consistently replicated in independent studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One potential explanation for this is the possibility that patients enrolled in such studies may have been erroneously classified with respect to their diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine the rate and type of misclassification in a large population of individuals referred for participation in an IBD genetics study and to examine the effect of diagnostic misclassification on the power to detect linkage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical records of 1096 patients entered into an IBD genetics programme were reviewed using standardised diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The original patient reported diagnoses were changed, if necessary, based on review, and the reasons for the change in diagnosis were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the effect of misclassification on linkage results, simulations were created with Gensim and analysed using Genehunter to evaluate a model for IBD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty eight of 1096 (6.2%) individuals had a change in diagnosis from that originally reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of changes were patients with either <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> who were determined not to have IBD at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The principal reasons for changes to the original diagnosis were discordance between the patients' subjective reports of diagnosis and actual clinical history, endoscopic, or pathological results; a change in disease pattern over time; and insufficient information available to confirm the original diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A 10% misclassification rate resulted in 28.4% and 40.2% loss of power to detect a true linkage when using a statistical model for a presumed IBD locus with lambda(s) values of 1.8 and 1.3, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic misclassification occurs in patients enrolled in IBD genetic studies and frequently involves assigning the diagnosis of IBD to non-affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Even low rates of diagnostic misclassification can lead to significant loss of power to detect a true linkage, particularly for loci with modest effects as are likely to be found in IBD </plain></SENT>
