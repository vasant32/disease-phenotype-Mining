<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to identify the molecular signature associated with UC remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We performed whole-genome transcriptional analysis of colonic biopsies from patients with histologically active and inactive UC, and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (non-IBD) controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR and immunostaining were used for validating selected genes in independent cohorts of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microarray analysis (n=43) demonstrates that UC patients in remission present an intestinal transcriptional signature that significantly differs from that of non-IBD controls and active patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four selected genes were validated in an independent cohort of patients (n=30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine of these genes were significantly regulated in UC-in-remission subjects compared with non-IBD controls, including a large number of epithelial cell-expressed genes such as REG4, S100P, SERPINB5, SLC16A1, DEFB1, AQP3 and AQP8, which modulate epithelial cell growth, sensitivity to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and immune function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-related genes such as REG1A and IL8 returned to control levels during remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>REG4, S100P, SERPINB5 and REG1A protein expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (n=23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the gene signature associated with remission allowed us to unravel pathways permanently deregulated in UC despite histological recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Given the strong link between the regulation of some of these genes and the growth and dissemination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancers</z:e>, we believe their aberrant expression in UC may provide a mechanism for epithelial hyper-proliferation and, in the context of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e>, for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
