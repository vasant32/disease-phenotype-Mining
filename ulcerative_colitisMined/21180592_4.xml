<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The description of the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) is based on systematic follow-up of population-based cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A steady increase in incidence of IBD has occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) is fairly uniform with a preponderance of left-sided disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One-third of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) patients present with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">colonic disease</z:e>, one-third with ileocolonic disease and one-third with small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IBD is associated with extra-intestinal manifestations (EIMs) in up to 36% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>Uveitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100534'>episcleritis</z:hpo> are the most common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cumulative probability of a relapsing course in UC is 90% after 25 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In CD disease behaviour varies substantially with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis behaviour is inflammatory in 70% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At follow-up there is a change to either stricturing or penetrating disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most patients with CD will eventually require surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for CD recurrence after surgery include penetrating/fistulizing disease behaviour, young age, short duration of disease before first surgery and ileocolonic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in UC seems to be decreasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in CD seems to be equivalent to the risk in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with small bowel CD are also at increased risk of small bowel <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CD is associated with a mortality rate 20-70% higher than expected, whereas mortality in UC is equivalent to that of the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The improved prognosis of IBD, especially UC, could be due to a chemopreventive effect of the medications used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to develop the best strategy for the reduction of mortality and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk in IBD </plain></SENT>
