<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Past and ongoing therapeutic concepts for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> have only been moderately successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A significant proportion of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> will still have to undergo colectomy and overall half of the patients do not achieve sustained remission, leading to impairment of physical and mental health, social life, employment issues and sexual activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reluctance to treat patients early on with sufficiently potent drug regimens is obvious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several popular misconceptions might have led to this situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> is still considered a more 'benign' disease than <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the general assumption is often that colectomy can 'cure' the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mucosal healing as a therapeutic target has not been widely accepted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, the use of antitumour <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor antibodies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> has been low because this treatment is considered to be less effective than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the current review we try to disprove these misunderstandings by discussing relevant studies showing how harmful this disease can be and explaining why future studies targeting sustained suppression of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> could have an enormous impact on the natural course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Until these studies are available, we encourage physicians to intensify and maintain treatment until sustained remission and mucosal healing has been reached </plain></SENT>
