<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Compared with other liver and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290807" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diarrhoeal diseases</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> have high specificity for PSC (+/- UC) and UC only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine the prevalence and significance of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> in these two diseases and whether the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> titre or IgG subclass, or both, could distinguish between PSC + UC and UC only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects included 63 patients with PSC, 85 with UC, 17 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coeliac disease</z:e>, and 10 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>dermatitis</z:hpo> herpeteformis and 36 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> was detected using the immunoalkaline phosphatase method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IgG subclass of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> was determined in 27 PSC + UC and 30 UC only patients using a panel of mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for the IgG subclasses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At a serum dilution of 1:5, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> had a diagnostic sensitivity of 65% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> PSC and 45% for UC only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For PSC + UC the sensitivity was 70% at 1:5 (p = 0.004 v UC only) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 1:50, the sensitivity values were 54% and 25% respectively for PSC + UC and UC only (p = 0.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In PSC, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> positivity was significantly associated with extensive involvement of the biliary tree but not with other clinical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In UC only, the median disease duration was significantly greater in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The PSC + UC <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> showed increased IgG3 compared with UC only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.05), together with increased IgG2 and IgG4 (p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> is a diagnostic marker in PSC and UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>While the higher titres and different IgG subclass distribution of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> in PSC + UC patients compared with those with UC only may reflect differences in underlying immune regulation, determination of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> titre and IgG subclass is unlikely to have a role in distinguishing between PSC + UC and UC only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Future identification of the antigen(s) for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> should allow the development of a more sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of these two conditions and also determine if <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> is associated with UC or PSC </plain></SENT>
