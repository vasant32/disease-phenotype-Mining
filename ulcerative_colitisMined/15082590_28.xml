<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several animal models for human <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, most <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> developed in these models have morphological and genetic characteristics different from UC associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To establish a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> model in p53 deficient mice by treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34674">dextran sulphate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (DSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DSS <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> was induced in homozygous p53 deficient mice (p53(-/-)-DSS), heterozygous p53 deficient mice (p53(+/-)-DSS) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice (p53+/+-DSS) by treatment with 4% DSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Numbers of developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> were compared among the experimental groups, and macroscopic and microscopic features of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, K-ras mutation and beta-catenin expression were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: p53(-/-)-DSS mice showed 100% incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> whereas the incidences in p53(+/-)-DSS and p53+/+-DSS mice were 46.2% and 13.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> were observed in the control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean numbers of total <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> per mouse were 5.0 (p53(-/-)-DSS), 0.62 (p53(+/-)-DSS), and 0.2 (p53+/+-DSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> per mouse in the p53(-/-)-DSS group was significantly higher than that in the other DSS groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidences of superficial type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> were 91.7% in p53(-/-)-DSS mice, 75.0% in p53(+/-)-DSS mice, and 33.3% in p53+/+-DSS mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The K-ras mutation was not detected in any of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Translocation of beta-catenin from the cell membrane to the cytoplasm or nucleus was observed in 19 of 23 (82.6%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The p53(-/-)-DSS mice is an excellent animal model of UC associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> because the morphological features and molecular genetics are similar to those of UC associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this model will contribute to the analysis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> related to human UC associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and the development of chemopreventive agents </plain></SENT>
