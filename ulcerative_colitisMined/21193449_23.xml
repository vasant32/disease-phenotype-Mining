<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hence, the objective of this study was to analyse incidence rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> among patients with Salmonella- or Campylobacter-positive and negative stool tests and to study the incidence of positive and negative stool tests among patients already diagnosed with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Danish population was followed for 94.3 million person-years during 1992-2008 using national registers to identify persons with positive and negative stool tests and patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using Poisson regression, incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for IBD after positive or negative stool tests and, conversely, IRRs for positive and negative stool tests following IBD, were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IRRs for IBD were significantly high in the first year after Salmonella- or Campylobacter-positive stool tests (IRRs 5.4-9.8), and they remained moderately increased 1-10 years later (IRRs 1.6-2.2), and less so &gt;10 years later (IRRs 0.8-1.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, IRRs for IBD &lt;1 year after a negative stool test were several-fold higher (IRRs 53.2-57.5), and a decreasing incidence pattern over time was parallel to that following positive test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients with IBD, IRRs for subsequent positive and-most notably-negative stool test results were also significantly high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Similarities in temporal risk patterns for IBD following positive or negative stool tests indicate that the increased occurrence of Salmonella- or Campylobacter-positive results around the time of first IBD hospitalisation results from detection bias </plain></SENT>
