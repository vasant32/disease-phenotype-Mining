<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether genetic factors are associated with adverse pouch outcomes such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> (CP) and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>-like (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDL</z:e>) phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: 866 patients were recruited from three centres in North America: Mount Sinai Hospital (Toronto, Ontario, Canada), the Cleveland Clinic (Cleveland, Ohio, USA) and Penn State Milton S Hershey Medical Center (Hershey, Pennsylvania, USA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA and clinical and demographic information were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were classified into post-surgical outcome groups: no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> (NCP), CP and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDL</z:e> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinical and genetic data were available on 714 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>487 (68.2%) were classified as NCP, 118 (16.5%) CP and 109 (15.3%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003040'>arthropathy</z:hpo> (p=0.02), primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> (p=0.009) and duration of time from ileostomy closure to recruitment (p=0.001) were significantly associated with outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The NOD2insC (rs2066847) risk variant was the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) most significantly associated with pouch outcome (p=7.4×10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Specifically, it was associated with both CP and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDL</z:e> in comparison with NCP (OR=3.2 and 4.3, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, SNPs in NOX3 (rs6557421, rs12661812), DAGLB (rs836518) and NCF4 (rs8137602) were shown to be associated with pouch outcome with slightly weaker effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A multivariable risk model combining previously identified clinical (smoking status, family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>), serological (anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody IgG, perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody and anti-CBir1) and genetic markers was constructed and resulted in an OR of 2.72 (p=8.89×10(-7)) for NCP versus CP/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDL</z:e> and 3.22 (p=4.11×10(-8)) for NCP versus <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDL</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Genetic polymorphisms, in particular, the NOD2insC risk allele, are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory pouch outcomes among patients with UC and IPAA </plain></SENT>
