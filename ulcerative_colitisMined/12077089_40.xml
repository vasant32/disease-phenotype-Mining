<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These include the TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE) which releases soluble TNF-alpha from transmembrane pro-TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate whether TACE activity is present in human colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Detergent extracts of cell membranes from colonic biopsies were obtained from 12 controls and 28 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Enzyme activity was measured by hydrolysis assays using pro-TNF-alpha or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25676">oligopeptide</z:chebi> substrates spanning the known pro-TNF-alpha cleavage site at Ala(76)-Val(77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cleavage products were identified by western blotting, high pressure liquid chromatography, or mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TACE protein was localised by immunohistochemistry and identified by western blotting of detergent extracts from purified lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMNC) or epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Detergent extracts released TNF-alpha from pro-TNF-alpha and cleaved a model <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25676">oligopeptide</z:chebi> as predicted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Substrate hydrolysis was sensitive to known TACE/matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors, but not trocade which has low activity against TACE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median TACE level was increased in active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (147 arbitrary units (AU)/mg; p&lt;0.01) but not in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (81 AU/mg) compared with controls (79 AU/mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both the full length proform and the active form of TACE protein were expressed in LPMNC cells and epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Functional TACE activity is ubiquitously expressed in the human colon and increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, raising interest in MMP inhibitors targeting TACE </plain></SENT>
