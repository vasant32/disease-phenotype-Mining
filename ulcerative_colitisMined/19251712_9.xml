<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> are at risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although prior studies have shown a link between HLA genotypes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) susceptibility, none have investigated HLA genotypes and UC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated HLA-DR/DQ alleles in UC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases and UC-controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, since methylation of the Class II transactivator (CIITA) gene may silence HLA expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, we correlated HLA allele frequencies with CIITA gene methylation and HLA-DR expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cases and controls were matched for duration/extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, age, ethnicity and gender, but not for primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> (PSC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted from archived tissue blocks from 114 UC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases and 114 UC-controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HLA-DR/DQ genotyping was performed using sequence-specific-oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction (SSO-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CIITA methylation was determined using methylation-specific PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HLA-DR immunohistochemistry was done following standard protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: UC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases were more likely than UC-controls to carry the DR17 or DR13 alleles (p&lt;0.0001 or p = 0.02, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although CIITA methylation did not vary significantly between cases and controls, DR17 and DQ2 were associated with CIITA methylation (p = 0.04 and 0.02, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>UC-controls more frequently carried the DR7, DR1 or DQ5 alleles (p = 0.002, 0.05 or 0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for PSC, DR17 remained significantly associated with an increased risk for UC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> while DR7 and DQ5 remained protective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We report a significant association between specific HLA alleles and either the risk for (DR17) or protection from (DR7, DQ5) UC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This suggests a possible genetic predisposition for increased UC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In addition, DQ2 and DR17 were associated with CIITA methylation </plain></SENT>
