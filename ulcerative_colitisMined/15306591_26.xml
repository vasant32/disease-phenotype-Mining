<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Two divergent patterns of mortality for smoking related diseases in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients were suggested in a previous population based study in Florence, Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Long term follow up (median 15 years) was completed to re-evaluate mortality in this Mediterranean cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Overall, 920 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> were followed until December 2001 or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, with seven patients (0.8%) lost to follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 14 040 person years were available for analysis; 118 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were observed (81/689 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 37/231 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were estimated using age, sex, and calendar specific national and local mortality rates; standardised mortality ratios (SMR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients, mortality was strongly increased for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal diseases</z:e> (SMR 4.49 (95% CI 1.80-9.25)), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (SMR 2.10 (95% CI 1.22-3.36)), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> (SMR 4.00 (95% CI 1.60-8.24)), leading to a significant 50% excess total mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients showed a significantly reduced total mortality because of lower cardiovascular (SMR 0.67 (95% CI 0.45-0.95)) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> (SMR 0.32 (95% CI 0.07-0.95)) mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant excess for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mortality was evident in this extended follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These clearly divergent patterns of mortality correlate with documented differences in smoking habits between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Family doctors and gastroenterologists should consider stopping cigarette smoking a specific priority for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients; the latter should be offered free participation in structured programmes for smoking cessation, with the aim of reducing smoking related excess mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, no evidence of an increased mortality for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="CRC">large bowel cancer</z:e> emerged in this series </plain></SENT>
