<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with 78 healthy persons as matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Distinctive, but similar, changes were present in the two diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An increased serum concentration of orosomucoid, alpha(1)-antitrypsin, easily precipitable <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>, alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin, haptoglobin, and haemopexin was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The serum concentration was decreased for prealbumin, albumin, alpha(2)-HS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>, caeruloplasmin, alpha(2)-macro-globulin, and transferrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant difference between the two diseases existed as far as the serum protein pattern was concerned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Certain proteins, ;the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase reactants' (orosomucoid, alpha(1)-antitrypsin, alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin, and haptoglobin) and the immunoglobulins were clinically useful, since their serum concentration reflected the grade of activity of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A pronounced elevation of haptoglobin compared with that of the other ;<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase reactants' was present in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> complicated by suppurative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> or abscesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> who responded favourably to medical treatment had significantly higher immunoglobulin levels than patients not responding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A similar observation, though not statistically significant, was made in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
