<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Histochemical studies have shown a relative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of colonic sulphated mucins (sulphomucins) in active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One possible explanation for this could be desulphation by <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> sulphatases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies have therefore been done to determine whether <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> faeces contain sulphatase and if so to determine whether this activity is increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a fluorimetric assay considerable sulphatase activity (greater than 0.3 IU/g pellet weight) was found in bacteria free filtrates of the homogenates of nine of 17 faecal samples from healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This sulphatase activity had an alkaline pH optimum (pH 8.5-9.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A similar range of faecal sulphatase activity with a similar pH optimum was found in samples from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (n = 39) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (n = 17) and there was no correlation with disease activity in either disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This faecal sulphatase activity may be involved in the degradation of colonic mucus and merits further study but these findings do not explain the relative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of colonic mucosal sulphomucins in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
