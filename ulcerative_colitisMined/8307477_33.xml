<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">Nicotine</z:chebi> was given subcutaneously by an Alzet mini-pump in doses of 0.5, 1.25, and 2 mg/kg/day for 14 days to three groups of eight animals and compared with eight controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean (SD) serum <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> concentrations (ng/ml) were 3.5 (1.1), 8.8 (2.3), and 16.2 (5.2) respectively in the treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The thickness of adherent mucus on rectal mucosa in controls (median 36 microns) was significantly reduced by low dose (22 microns, p = 0.0011), and increased by high dose <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> (48 microns, p = 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incorporation of radioactive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">glucosamine</z:chebi> into papain resistant glycoconjugates was unchanged, indicating that mucin synthesis was unaltered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">Prostaglandins</z:chebi> (PG) were reduced, in some cases significantly (6-keto <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi>, PGF2 alpha, and hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid), by <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi>, which showed an inverse dose dependence--with greatest inhibition in relation to the lowest dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">Nicotine</z:chebi>, and possibly smoking, may affect <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> by an action on mucosal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23899">eicosanoids</z:chebi> and on adherent surface mucus secretion in the rectum and large bowel </plain></SENT>
