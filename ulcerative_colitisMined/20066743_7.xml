<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To understand the demographic characteristics of patients in Southwestern Ontario, Canada with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) in order to predict disease severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Records from 1996 to 2001 were examined to create a database of UC patients seen in the London Health Sciences Centre South Street Hospital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Inflammatory Bowel Disease</z:e> Clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To be included, patients' charts were required to have information of their disease presentation and a minimum of 5 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Charts were reviewed using standardized data collection forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disease severity was generated during the chart review process, and non-endoscopic Mayo Score criteria were collected into a composite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and two consecutive patients' data were entered into the database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Demographic analyses revealed that 51% of the patients were male, the mean age at diagnosis was 39 years, 13.7% had a first degree relative with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD), 61.8% were nonsmokers and 24.5% were ex-smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 22.5% of patients the disease was limited to the rectum, in 21.6% disease was limited to the sigmoid colon, in 22.5% disease was limited to the left colon, and 32.4% of patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0868908" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pancolitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Standard multiple regression analysis which regressed a composite of physician global assessment of disease severity, average number of bowel movements, and average amount of blood in bowel movements on year of diagnosis and age at time of diagnosis was significant, R(2) = 0.306, F (7, 74) = 4.66, P &lt; 0.01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Delay from symptoms to diagnosis of UC, gender, family history of IBD, smoking status and disease severity at the time of diagnosis did not significantly predict the composite measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: UC severity is associated with younger age at diagnosis and year of diagnosis in a longitudinal cohort of UC patients, and may identify prognostic UC indicators </plain></SENT>
