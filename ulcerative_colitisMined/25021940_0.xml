<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The case for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) therapy has been comprehensively compiled in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, with trials showing its efficacy in both induction and maintenance of remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the evidence remains patchy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BSG guidelines recommend its trial as a second-line agent in those patients intolerant of, or resistant to, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> (AZA) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50667">mercaptopurine</z:chebi> (MP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previous studies show conflicting results for MTX in UC; with response rates between 22-33%, with a high rate of colectomy, 44%, in one of the studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We aimed to review the clinical effectiveness of MTX in our cohort of UC patients who had previously tried, or failed, with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients taking MTX for UC was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects were identified from our <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had trialled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> therapy prior to MTX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Their outcomes on these treatments, including reasons for discontinuation, were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is current policy within our department to start with oral MTX (plus <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> supplementation), initially 15 mg once weekly, increasing to 20mg or 25mg as necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinical response at 12 weeks and 12 months was used to assess efficacy of MTX treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was steroid-free remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 21 UC patients (male = 62%) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Median age was 61 years (range 21-82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Disease pattern was extensive (43%), left-sided (19%), and recto-sigmoid (38%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Reasons for AZA/MP discontinuation were intolerance to therapy (38%), and failure of therapy (62%) despite dose optimisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Steroid-free remission was achieved in 11 patients (52%), and this appears sustained at 12 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A further 4 patients (19%) report improved symptoms with MTX, but remain dependent on low-dose steroids (although it is noted that 1 of these patients has co-existent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> which may explain this) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>MTX was discontinued in 4 patients (19%) because of a lack of clinical response (n = 1), side-effects (n = 2) or planned pregnancy (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Side-effects reported with MTX were liver toxicity and skin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rashes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>A final 2 patients (10%) have shown promising results with MTX but are not yet eligible for 12-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Of the 21 patients included, 20 remain on oral therapy, and one has switched to parenteral MTX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Of note, none of the MTX patients have progressed to colectomy, in contrast to previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study has shown good efficacy with MTX, with approximately half of UC patients achieving steroid-free clinical remission at 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In contrast to previous studies, our experience suggests it is a useful treatment option in patients previously failing or intolerant of optimised <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>DISCLOSURE OF INTEREST: None Declared </plain></SENT>
