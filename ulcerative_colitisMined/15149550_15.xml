<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endoscopic findings are essential in evaluating the disease activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate how endoscopists assess individual endoscopic features of mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, the inter-observer agreement, and the importance of the observers' experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five video clips of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> were shown to a group of experienced and a group of inexperienced endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both groups were asked to assess eight endoscopic features and the overall mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> on a visual analogue scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following statistical analyses were used; Contingency tables analysis, kappa analysis, analysis of variance, Pearson linear correlation analysis, general linear models, and agreement analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> tests were carried out two-tailed, with a significance level of 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The inter-observer agreement ranged from very good to moderate in the experienced group and from very good to fair in the inexperienced group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly better inter-observer agreement in the experienced group in the rating of 6 out of 9 features (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The experienced and inexperienced endoscopists scored the "ulcerations" significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The inter-observer variation of the mean score of "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath>", "ulcerations" and endoscopic activity index in mild disease, and the scoring of "<z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo>" and "<z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>" in moderate-severe disease was significantly higher in the inexperienced group.A correlation was seen between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the observed endoscopic features in both groups of endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among experienced endoscopists, a set of four endoscopic variables ("Vascular pattern", "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>Erosions</z:mpath>", "Ulcerations" and Friability") explained 92% of the variation in EAI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>By including "Granularity" in these set 91% of the variation in EAI was explained in the group of inexperienced endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The inter-observer agreement in the rating of endoscopic features characterising <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> is satisfactory in both groups of endoscopists but significantly higher in the experienced group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The difference in the mean score between the two groups is only significant for "ulcerations" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The endoscopic variables "Vascular pattern", "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>Erosions</z:mpath>", "Ulcerations" and Friability" explained the overall endoscopic activity index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Even though the present result is quite satisfactory, there is a potential of improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Improved grading systems might contribute to improve the consistency of endoscopic descriptions </plain></SENT>
