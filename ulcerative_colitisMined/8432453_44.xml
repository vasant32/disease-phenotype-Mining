<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A high frequency of positive tests for IgG anti-lactoferrin antibodies was found in sera from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (50%) and primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> only 4 of 52 (8%) sera had anti-lactoferrin antibodies--in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four instances the sera belonged to patients with disease involving the colon </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Low levels of IgG antibodies against myeloperoxidase or alpha antigen were also found occasionally in sera from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IgA antibodies directed against lactoferrin and alpha antigen (but not myeloperoxidase) were seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three conditions </plain></SENT>
