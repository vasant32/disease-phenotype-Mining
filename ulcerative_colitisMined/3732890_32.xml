<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the time of each faecal granulocyte measurement the serum concentration of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase protein C-reactive protein and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>C-reactive protein concentration was significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> than <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> both overall and particularly in relation to given levels of granulocyte excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No such distinction was observed between the erythrocyte sedimentation rates in the two diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present findings show that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase response differs significantly between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> may be constitutionally different from those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and unable to mount a major <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase response to their own disease </plain></SENT>
