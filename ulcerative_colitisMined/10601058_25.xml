<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro work has shown that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> may be characterised by a metabolic defect in colonocyte <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To investigate the rate of metabolism of rectally administered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> in patients with quiescent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: [1-(13)C]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> enemas were administered to 11 patients with long standing quiescent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and to 10 control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rate of production of (13)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> in exhaled breath over four hours was measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry combined with indirect calorimetry in order to measure <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This allowed calculation of the patients' resting energy expenditure and respiratory quotient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over a four hour period, 325 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> 21) micromol (13)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> was recovered in breath samples from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> group compared with 322 (17) micromol from the control group (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The respiratory quotient of the colitic group was significantly lower than that of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There was no difference in the rate of metabolism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is unlikely that there is a primary metabolic defect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> metabolism in patients with quiescent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
