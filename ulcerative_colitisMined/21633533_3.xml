<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To examine the efficacy of glycyrrhizin preparation (GL-p) in the treatment of a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> was induced by oral administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32149">sodium sulfate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> were intrarectally administered GL-p or saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> was evaluated based on body <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, colon wet weight, and macroscopic damage score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the inflamed mucosa were measured by cytokine antibody array analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of GL-p on myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the inflamed mucosa and purified enzyme was assayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: GL-p treatment significantly ameliorated the extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> compared to sham treatment with saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cytokine antibody array analysis showed that GL-p treatment significantly decreased the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α, cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-2, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in the inflamed mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, GL-p inhibited the oxidative activity of mucosal and purified MPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: GL-p enema has a therapeutic effect on experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in rats and may be useful in the treatment of UC </plain></SENT>
