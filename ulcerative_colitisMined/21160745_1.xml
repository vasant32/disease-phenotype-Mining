<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Capsule endoscopy (CE) offers state-of-the-art imaging of the small bowel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> its clinical role is still uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report analyses the usefulness of CE in patients with suspected Cronh's disease, in patients with established <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (when assessing severity, occult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo> and/or as a guide to therapy), in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> unclassified (IBDU), and in individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first item in this group is the most important although there is no strong evidence to establish the position of CE in the diagnostic workup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with established <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, recently developed activity scores are promising tools for an accurate assessment of severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a guide to therapy, CE should be focused on patients with unexplained symptoms when other investigations are inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's Disease</z:hpo>, international consensus recommended considering CE only if ileocolonoscopy is contraindicated or unsuccessful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the case of IBDU, studies have shown a significant proportion of patients reclassified with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this setting, CE could have a role determining small bowel involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The role of CE in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Some authors advocate CE before colectomy for refractory cases in order to exclude <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In summary, CE offers a new horizon in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, and a better knowledge of mucosal abnormalities that could offer a paradigm shift: changing from symptom-based disease activity estimation to direct mucosal healing monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, randomized controlled studies are still needed to provide stronger evidence in this setting </plain></SENT>
