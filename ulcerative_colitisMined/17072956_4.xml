<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral blood was obtained from 131 patients with UC and 106 healthy controls for DNA extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined LPL gene polymorphisms affecting the enzyme at Ser447stop, as well as Hind III and Pvu II polymorphisms using PCR techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PCR products were characterized by PCR-RFLP and direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms were examined for association with clinical features in UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genotype frequencies for LPL polymorphisms were also compared between UC patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> at age 20 years or younger, C/G and G/G genotypes for Ser447stop polymorphism were more prevalent than C/C genotype (OR = 3.13, 95% CI = 0.95-10.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with H(+/-) or H(-/-) genotype for Hind III polymorphism also were more numerous than those with H(+/+) genotype (OR = 2.51, 95% CI = 0.85-7.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the group with H(+/+) genotype for Hind III polymorphism, more patients had serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentrations over 150 mg/dL than patients with H(+/-) or H(-/-) genotype (P &lt; 0.01, OR = 6.46, 95% CI = 1.39-30.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hypertriglycemia was also more prevalent in patients with P(+/+) genotypes for Pvu II polymorphism (P &lt; 0.05, OR = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.06-8.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Genotype frequency for LPL polymorphism did not differ significantly between UC patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ser447stop and Hind III LPL polymorphisms may influence <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of UC, while Hind III and Pvu II polymorphisms influence serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> in UC patients </plain></SENT>
