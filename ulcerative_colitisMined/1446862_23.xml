<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The detection of a nuclear anti-neutrophil antibody in patients with primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> (PSC), using an immunoperoxidase technique, was recently reported by us </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, detection of a cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil antibody was reported by others, using a two stage procedure of enzyme linked immunosorbent assay followed by an immunofluorescent method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Detection of cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil antibody in PSC, which, in contrast to that two stage procedure, uses a simple one step immuno-alkaline phosphatase method is now reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> human neutrophils were cytocentrifuged, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> fixed, and then incubated with coded patients' sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rabbit anti-human immunoglobulin conjugated with alkaline phosphatase was used to detect the bound antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fast red was used to visualise the reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty three of 30 (77%) PSC patients showed positive granular cytoplasmic staining (with some perinuclear accentuation) with a network of cytoplasmic filaments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of 45 (33%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients and 1 of 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> active <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> patients showed similar staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty five of 152 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> active <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>, and a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0156194" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">other liver diseases</z:e> showed a different pattern of cytoplasmic labelling, with no surrounding filaments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seventy nine patients, including seven PSC patients and 33 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In comparison, 86% of PSC patients, 57% of patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002613'>biliary cirrhosis</z:hpo>, 50% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, and well over 60% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023896" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alcoholic liver disease</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> active <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> were positive using the one step immunofluorescent method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This method is more specific for PSC than those described in recent reports and may be of diagnostic importance </plain></SENT>
