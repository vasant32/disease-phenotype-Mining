<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The serum lysozyme, on the other hand, is a measure of neutrophil (and monocyte) turnover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean serum TBBC was significantly raised in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (range 1.23-5.51 ng/ml; mean 2.64 ng/ml) and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (range 1.58-9.29 ng/ml; mean 2.93 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The elevated values were shown to be due to rises in the granulocyte-secreted binding proteins, transcobalamins I and III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The TBBC was shown to rise with increasing activity of disease and to correlate roughly with the blood neutrophil granulocyte count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> also had a significantly raised mean level of serum lysozyme (range 3.1 to 10.4 mug/ml; mean 6.8 mug/ml), but there was no correlation in individual patients between serum lysozyme and total B(12)-binding capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results are taken to indicate an enlarged granulocyte pool and increased granulocyte turnover in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
