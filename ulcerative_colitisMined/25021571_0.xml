<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>) preparations are used to induce and maintain remission in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cost of the recommended maintenance dose for oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5ASA</z:chebi> preparations varies from 86p and 208p per day (MIMMS 2011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Switching to cheaper <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5ASAs</z:chebi> has been suggested as a possible drug cost saving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The BNF states that preparations are not interchangeable but with little direct evidence to support this statement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this pilot study is to gain preliminary data on a primary care based <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5ASA</z:chebi> switching programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">Salofalk</z:chebi> granules (Dr Falk Pharma) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">Pentasa</z:chebi> (Ferring Pharmaceuticals) were identified as the cheapest <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5ASA</z:chebi> items prescribed in 31 GP practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An initial pilot study in one practice revealed that only 5/21 patients responded to a written invitation alone and successfully switched to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">Salofalk</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We therefore developed a managed programme utilising a community based gastroenterology nurse specialist in 4 other practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A written invitation detailing the rationale for switching <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> was sent to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> appropriate patients who were then phoned a week later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If patients agreed to the switch, the GP surgery was contacted by the Nurse Specialist to change the repeat prescription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients were switched to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">Salofalk</z:chebi> in 2 practices and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">Pentasa</z:chebi> in the other 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>GP and hospital records were then examined 6 months post-switch to assess for evidence of patient acceptability and tolerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 120 patients (56 male, 64 female) with a mean age of 50 years were identified as being on a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> preparation (oral or topical) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>56 (47%) were under either virtual or hospital gastroenterology follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>64 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> were taking oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>21 (33%) were already taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">Salofalk</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">Pentasa</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 43 patients, 24 (56%) agreed to the switch, 10 (23%) declined, and 9 (21%) did not respond to the invitation or telephone call </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Of the 24 patients who agreed to switch, only 17 (71%) completed the process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>15 (88%) remained on the new <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> for at least 6 months, with reasons for discontinuation cited as preference for the previous preparation or diarrhoeal symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Conducting a managed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5ASA</z:chebi> switching programme is feasible with 17/43 eligible patients successfully switched with 15/17 continuing on these preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Areas for development include following up patients who initially agreed but failed to switch, recording more robustly any flares, involving secondary physicians and assessing adherence and cost savings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>This study provides preliminary evidence to develop a large scale study in this important area </plain></SENT>
