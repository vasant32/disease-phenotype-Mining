<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine environmental risk factors prior to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> in a paediatric population based case control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 222 incident cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and 60 incident cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> occurring before 17 years of age between January 1988 and December 1997 were matched with one control subject by sex, age, and geographical location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We recorded 140 study variables in a questionnaire that covered familial history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, events during the perinatal period, infant and child diet, vaccinations and childhood diseases, household amenities, and the family's socioeconomic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In a multivariate model, familial history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (odds ratio (OR) 4.3 (95% confidence interval 2.3-8)), breast feeding (OR 2.1 (1.3-3.4)), bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccination (OR 3.6 (1.1-11.9)), and history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>eczema</z:hpo> (OR 2.1 (1-4.5)) were significant risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> whereas regular drinking of tap water was a protective factor (OR 0.56 (0.3-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Familial history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (OR 12.5 (2.2-71.4)), disease during pregnancy (OR 8.9 (1.5-52)), and bedroom sharing (OR 7.1 (1.9-27.4)) were risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> whereas appendicectomy was a protective factor (OR 0.06 (0.01-0.36)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: While family history and appendicectomy are known risk factors, changes in risk based on domestic promiscuity, certain vaccinations, and dietary factors may provide new aetiological clues </plain></SENT>
