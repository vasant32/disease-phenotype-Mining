<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mucin samples purified from snap frozen rectal biopsy specimens obtained from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (n = 12), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (n = 5), and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> control subjects (n = 9) were subject to ion exchange chromatography using a continuous 0-0.35 mol/l <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> salt gradient with a final 2.5 mol/l <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> step </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples the major proportion (mean (SD) 86.7 (8.9)%) of the mucin detectable by wheat germ agglutinin binding eluted between 0.15 and 0.35 mol/l <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> with no significant difference in elution profile between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant elution of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> at less than 0.15 mol/l <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> did occur, however, when a lower molecular weight mucin containing fraction which contained concanavalin A positive (<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> containing) material was analysed similarly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar ion exchange profiles were obtained when (3H)N-acetylglucosamine labelled mucins were studied after tissue culture of rectal biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant alteration in the ion exchange profile of purified mucins in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> has been shown in these studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is possible that the previously reported relative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of mucin subclass IV (eluting with 0.20 mol/l <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>) may simply have reflected mucin <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
