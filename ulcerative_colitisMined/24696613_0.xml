<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 219 consecutive patients with IBD, of which 146 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and 73 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, regularly seen at the outpatient unit of the Division of Gastroenterology at the University Hospital Pedro Ernesto of the State University of Rio de Janeiro, a tertiary referral center, were enrolled in this study from February 2009 to January 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the presence of major TPMT genetic variants (TPMT 2, 3A, 3C) in IBD patients by means of a specific allele and RFLP-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes by proteinase-K/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate</z:chebi> digestion and <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="59" ids="35255">chloroform</z:chebi> extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TPMT 2 (C238G), TPMT 3A (G460A/A719G), and TPMT 3C (A719G) genotypes were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction followed by direct sequencing with specific primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical data were systematically recorded, and correlated with the genotype results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The distribution of the selected TPMT gene polymorphism TPMT 2 (C238G), TPMT 3A (G460A/A719G), and TPMT 3C (A719G) genotypes was 3.6%, 5.4%, and 7.7% of the patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the side effects recorded from patients taking <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>, 14 patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> and/or an elevation of pancreatic enzymes, while 6 patients had liver toxicity, and 2 patients exhibited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TPMT polymorphisms were detected in 37/219 patients (8 heterozygous for 2, 11 heterozygous for 3A, and 18 heterozygous for 3C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No homozygotic polymorphisms were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite the prevalence of the TPMT 3C genotype, no differences among the genotype frequencies were significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although no association was detected regarding myelotoxicity or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235378,C0348754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">hepatotoxicity</z:e>, a trend towards the elevation of pancreatic enzymes was observed for TPMT 2 and TPMT 3C genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of TPMT genotypes was high among Brazilian patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Variants genes 2 and 3C may be associated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> pancreatic toxicity in a IBD southeastern Brazilian population </plain></SENT>
