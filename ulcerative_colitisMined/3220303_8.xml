<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxicity of antibodies towards RPMI 4788 was studied by means of a <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> release assay using peripheral blood mononuclear leucocytes of healthy subjects as effector cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a four hour antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity assay sera from 29% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients contained antibodies cytotoxic for the target, while only 3% of the Crohn's patients and 6% of the disease controls and non of the healthy controls were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When an 18 hour assay was applied, however, not only 40% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients, but also 14% of Crohn's patients and 21% of disease controls were found positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reactive antibody in the four hour assay was mainly of the IgG class, which points at a classical antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 18 hour cytotoxic assay IgG and particularly IgM antibodies were found to be reactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that in the latter case other cellular cytotoxic mechanism might be involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant inverse correlation between the appearance of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> restricted IgG-anticolon epithelial cell antibodies (four hour assay) and the disease activity (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Absorption studies showed that the reactive antigen is not specific for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> colonic tissue, but is similarly found in Crohn's bowel tissue, and to a lower extent in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bowel, liver and kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reactive antigen, however, could not be detected in brain and lymphoblastoid cells </plain></SENT>
