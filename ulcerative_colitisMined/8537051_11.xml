<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The timing of p53 mutations in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> associated colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (UCACRC) is, however, less certain and some reports suggest that it may be a relatively early event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study sought to establish the timing of p53 mutations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> arising in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blocks of 10 resected colorectal specimens from patients who had had a biopsy positive for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> at least one year prior to resection were retrieved from the archives of St Mark's Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunochemistry using the monoclonal antibody DO-7, specific for both mutant and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> p53, was performed on sections from both the resection specimens and dysplastic biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven of the 10 resection specimens were positive for p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of these seven specimens showed p53 overexpression in specimens taken two years before the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> or high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five of the seven specimens were negative for p53 overexpression between one and four years prior to resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that p53 overexpression is usually a late event in the development of UCACRCs </plain></SENT>
