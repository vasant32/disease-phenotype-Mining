<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The genetic contribution to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) is under investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence indicates a significant linkage between a locus on chromosome 19p13 and IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association between an intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1 gene (ICAM-1) polymorphism located on chromosome 19p13 and IBD in a Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared 207 Japanese patients who had IBD (79 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD); 128 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC)) with 103 unrelated Japanese controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We determined R241G and K469E polymorphisms of the ICAM-1 gene using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both frequency and carriage rate of the K469 allele were significantly higher in IBD patients than in controls (allelic frequency, p(c)=0.0026; carriage rate, p(c)=0.0034; odds ratio 2.59; 95% confidence interval 1.42-4.68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the frequency of the K469 allele was significantly increased in both CD and UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis demonstrated that both K469 allelic frequency and K469 carriage rate were significantly higher in patients with the small bowel and colon type of CD and entire <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We identified an overall association between IBD and ICAM-1 K469 in a Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies of this chromosome region are required to elucidate the gene responsible for IBD </plain></SENT>
