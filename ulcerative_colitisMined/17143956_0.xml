<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the expression of fragile histidine triad (FHIT) protein in 64 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), and its relation with clinicopathological data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rabbit-anti-FHIT antibody was used to detect FHIT protein expression in 64 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi>-microwave-streptavidin (SP)-HRP immunohistochemical method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The positive FHIT protein expression was 22.79% +/- 16.16%, 42.14% +/- 16.82% in active and remittent phases of UC, 36.07% +/- 19.23% in CD, and 57.05% +/- 8.86% in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant differences in FHIT protein expression were observed between the active and remittent phases of UC, between the active phase of UC and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon mucosa, as well as between the remittent phase of UC and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon mucosa, and between CD and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results show that FHIT protein expression is completely absent or reduced in IBD, suggesting that the FHIT gene might be associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> and progression of IBD, an early event from inflammatory conditions to <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in IBD </plain></SENT>
