<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In an open label pilot study, we supple-mented a group of 25 patients (11 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and 14 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>) in stable clinical conditions and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> with a food supplement which does not contain iron but contains a standardized fraction of fish cartilage <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycans</z:chebi> and a mixture of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> (Captafer Medestea, Turin, Italy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients received 500 mg, twice a day during meals, for at least 4 mo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were suggested to maintain their alimentary habit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At time 0 and after 2 and 4 mo, emocrome, sideremia and ferritin were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Paired data were analyzed with Student's t test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three patients relapsed during the study (2 in the 3rd mo, 1 in the 4th mo), two patients were lost to follow up and two patients dropped out (1 for orticaria, 1 for gastric burning) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 18 patients, levels of serum iron started to rapidly increase within the 2nd mo of treatment, P &lt; 0.05), whereas serum ferritin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> needed a longer period to significantly improve their serum levels (mo 4) P &lt; 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The product was safe, easy to administer and well tolerated by patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggest a potential new treatment for IBD patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and warrant further larger controlled studies </plain></SENT>
