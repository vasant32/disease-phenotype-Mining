<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intraepithelial lymphocyte counts were performed in biopsy specimens obtained from ileal pouches and compared with counts in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ileum and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T lymphocyte and macrophage subpopulations were characterised immunohistochemically in pouch biopsy specimens using a panel of monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> ileum was used as a control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intraepithelial lymphocyte densities (expressed as intraepithelial lymphocyte/100 epithelial cells) in pouches with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> were significantly less than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ileum, and approached counts found in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant increase in counts even in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the helper/inducer to suppressor/cytotoxic T cell (CD4:CD8) ratios between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ileum and pouches with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e>, either in the epithelium or in the lamina propria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportions of RFD9+ (epithelioid cells and tingible body macrophages) and 3G8+ (CD16) macrophages were significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> compared with pouches without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ileum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the three groups in the proportions of cells positive for the other macrophage markers (CD68, RFD1-dendritic cells, and RFD7-mature macrophages) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The significance of low intraepithelial lymphocyte counts in ileal pouches is unknown, but this may be an adaptive response to the new <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since an increase in RFD9+ macrophages occurs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, but does not occur as a non-specific response to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infective process, their presence in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> suggests that effector mechanisms similar to those triggering the original <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> may be operating in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
