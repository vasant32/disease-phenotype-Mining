<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some UC patients remain refractory to conventional medical treatment while, in others, the effectiveness of drugs is limited by side-effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and leukocyte removal therapy have been used for refractory UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To predict the efficacy of these therapies is important for appropriate selection of treatment options and for preparation for colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy is the cornerstone for diagnosis and evaluation of UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic parameters in patients with severe or refractory UC may predict a clinical response to therapies, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> or leukocyte removal therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As for the patients with quiescent UC, relapse of UC is difficult to predict by routine colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Even when routine colonoscopy suggests remission and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosal appearance, microscopic abnormalities may persist and relapse may occur later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To more accurately identify disease activity and to predict exacerbations in UC patients with clinically inactive disease is important for deciding whether medical treatment should be maintained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Magnifying colonoscopy is useful for the evaluation of disease activity and for predicting relapse in patients with UC </plain></SENT>
