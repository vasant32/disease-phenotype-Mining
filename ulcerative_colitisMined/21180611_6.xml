<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Probiotics have been used as a treatment modality for over a century </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They may restore <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> microflora and effect the functioning of the GI tract by a variety of mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Probiotics are not currently regulated and only few randomized controlled trials exist investigating their efficacy in different GI disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They are available in a variety of formulations and delivery systems making interpretation and comparison of studies even more difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of probiotics, either as a single strain or a combination of probiotics, has been tested in antibiotic-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, Clostridium difficile <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022104" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IBS">irritable bowel syndrome</z:e>, among other disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results of the studies are reviewed in this article and recommendations for probiotic use in these disorders are made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although probiotics appear to be generally safe in an outpatient setting, the situation may be different in immunocompromised, hospitalized patients who may be at a greater risk of developing probiotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No studies exist addressing the issue of safety specifically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Many questions regarding use of probiotics in GI disorders remain to be answered in future studies, such as most optimal doses, duration of treatment, physiological and immunological effects, efficacy of specific probiotics in specific <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp>, and safety in debilitated patients </plain></SENT>
