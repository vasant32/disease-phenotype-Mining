<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">Glucocorticoids</z:chebi> (GCS) remain one of the mainstay treatments in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) but up to a third of patients will ultimately fail to respond and progress to a more severe and difficult to manage disease state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous clinical studies suggest that the Toll-Like Receptor 9 (TLR9) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> DIMS0150 not only induces production of key anti-inflammatory cytokines as IL-10 but interestingly also enhances steroid sensitivity in steroid refractory UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated, in the context of a clinical study, whether a pre-selection of steroid response genes could identify steroid refractory UC subjects most likely to respond to DIMS0150 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a non-interventional pilot study, blood from steroid refractory UC patients and healthy volunteers was taken and thirty-four previously described steroid response genes were analysed by real time PCR analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To establish clinical utility of the identified biomarkers, a placebo controlled, randomized, double blinded study in active steroid dependent and steroid resistant UC patients on concomitant steroid therapies was used (EudraCT number: 2006-001846-15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified three potential biomarkers CD163, TSP-1 and IL-1RII whose response to steroids was significantly enhanced when DIMS0150 was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four subjects were randomized to receive a single rectal administration of placebo or 30Â mg of DIMS0150 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood derived PBMCs were obtained prior to dosing and assayed for evidence of a steroid enhancing effect following steroid incubation in the presence of DIMS0150 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparison to established steroid sensitivity marker IL-6 confirmed that clinical responders are steroid refractory UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Upon study completion and un-blinding, the biomarker assay correctly predicted a clinical response in over 90% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Using specific steroid response biomarkers, GCS refractory UC patients most likely to benefit from DIMS0150 treatment could be identified and illustrates the usefulness of a personalized treatment approach </plain></SENT>
