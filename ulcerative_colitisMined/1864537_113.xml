<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the prognostic importance of microscopic rectal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> we followed up 82 patients (aged 21 to 78 years, 44 men) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> quiescent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> over 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At trial entry each patient underwent a rectal biopsy and sections were graded independently by two histopathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory cell infiltrate of varying severity was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> biopsy specimens, and 58% had crypt architectural irregularities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, 32% had evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> inflammatory activity: 28% <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> inflammatory cell infiltrate, 11% <z:mp ids='MP_0000491'>crypt abscesses</z:mp>, and 22% mucin <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Agreement between the two histopathologists for the presence of each of these features was 94% (90-98%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the 12 month follow up 27 patients (33%) relapsed after a mean interval of 18 weeks (range 3-44 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relapse rates were unrelated to duration or extent of disease or to the type of maintenance drug treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> inflammatory cell infiltrate 52% relapsed, whereas in the absence of such an infiltrate only 25% relapsed (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, relapse rates were higher in the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0000491'>crypt abscesses</z:mp> (78% v 27%, p less than 0.005), mucin <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> (56% v p less than 0.02), and breaches in the surface epithelium (75% v 31%, p = 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory cell infiltrate or crypt architectural irregularities, however, bore no relation to the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> relapse </plain></SENT>
