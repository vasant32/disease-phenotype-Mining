<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This review provides a summary of the global epidemiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is now clear that IBD is increasing worldwide and has become a global emergence disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IBD, which includes <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), has been considered a problem in industrial-urbanized societies and attributed largely to a Westernized lifestyle and other associated environmental factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Its incidence and prevalence in developing countries is steadily rising and has been attributed to the rapid modernization and Westernization of the population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is a need to reconcile the most appropriate treatment for these patient populations from the perspectives of both disease presentation and cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the West, biological agents are the fastest-growing segment of the prescription drug market </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These agents cost thousands of dollars per patient per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The healthcare systems, and certainly the patients, in developing countries will struggle to afford such expensive treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The need for biological therapy will inevitably increase dramatically, and the pharmaceutical industry, healthcare providers, patient advocate groups, governments and non-governmental organizations should come to a consensus on how to handle this problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The evidence that IBD is now affecting a much younger population presents an additional concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Meta-analyses conducted in patients acquiring IBD at a young age also reveals a trend for their increased risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), since the cumulative incidence rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in IBD-patients diagnosed in childhood are higher than those observed in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, IBD-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> has a worse prognosis than <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, even when the stage at diagnosis is taken into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with additional evidence that IBD negatively impacts <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A continuing increase in IBD incidence worldwide associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011463'>childhood-onset</z:hpo> of IBD coupled with the diseases' longevity and an increase in oncologic transformation suggest a rising disease burden, morbidity, and healthcare costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>IBD and its associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> appear inevitable, which may significantly impact pediatric gastroenterology and adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Due to an infrastructure gap in terms of access to care between developed vs. developing nations and the uneven representation of IBD across socioeconomic strata, a plan is needed in the developing world regarding how to address this emerging problem </plain></SENT>
