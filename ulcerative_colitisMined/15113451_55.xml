<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alteration of the intestinal microflora by antibiotic or probiotic therapy may induce and maintain remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this randomized, placebo-controlled trial was to determine the effect of oral Lactobacillus GG (L </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven patients with moderate to active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> were enrolled in this trial to receive either L </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was sustained remission, defined as freedom from relapse at the 6 months follow-up visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Relapse was defined as an increase in CDAI of &gt;100 points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 5/11 patients finished the study, with 2 patients in each group in sustained remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median time to relapse was 16 +/- 4 weeks in the L </plain></SENT>
