<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An imbalance of their profile in favour of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> initiation may lead to <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp>, such as that is observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) is often described as a prototype of T-helper 1-type diseases, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) is traditionally viewed as a T-helper 2-mediated condition, the classic paradigm, which categorises cytokines into pro- and anti-inflammatory groups, has recently been changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> regulatory pathways may not be mutually exclusive as individual cytokines can have diverse and even opposing functions in various clinical and immunological settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None the less there are many common immunological responses in IBD that are mediated by cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although they regulate and influence the development, course and recurrence of the inflammatory process, the concrete pathogenic role of these small signaling molecules is sometimes not unambiguous in the subtypes of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our aim is to review the current information about pro- and anti-inflammatory effects of traditionally studied and recently discovered cytokines in the pathogenesis of UC and CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The better understanding of their production and functional activity may lead to the development of new therapeutic modalities </plain></SENT>
