<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The cause and pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> are both mainly unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously used whole-genome microarray technique on biopsies obtained from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> to identify 5 changed mucosal transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare mucosal expressions of these five transcripts in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients vs. controls, along with the transcript expression in relation to the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Colonic mucosal specimens from rectum and caecum were taken at ambulatory colonoscopy from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients (n = 49) with defined inflammatory activity and disease extension, and from controls (n = 67) without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The five mucosal transcripts aldolase B, elafin, MST-1, simNIPhom and SLC6A14 were analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant transcript differences in the rectal mucosa for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five transcripts were demonstrated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The grade of transcript expression was related to the clinical disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The five gene transcripts were changed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and were related to the disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The known biological function of some of the transcripts may contribute to the inflammatory features and indicate a possible role of microbes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings may also contribute to our pathophysiological understanding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
