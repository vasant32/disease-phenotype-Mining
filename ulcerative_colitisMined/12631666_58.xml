<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the IBD5 risk haplotype in both British and Japanese cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Disease associations have also been reported for CARD15/NOD2 and TNF variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complex interactions between susceptibility loci have been shown in animal models, and we tested for potential gene-gene interactions between the three CD associated loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Family based association analyses were performed in 457 British families (252 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, 282 CD trios) genotyped for the IBD5 haplotype, common CARD15, and TNF-857 variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To test for possible epistatic interactions between variants, transmission disequilibrium test analyses were further stratified by genotype at other loci, and novel log linear analyses were performed using the haplotype relative risk model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Case control association analyses were performed in 178 Japanese CD patients and 156 healthy controls genotyped for the IBD5 haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The IBD5 haplotype was associated with CD (p=0.007), but not with UC, in the British Caucasian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CARD15 variants and IBD5 haplotype showed additive main effects, and in particular no evidence for epistatic interactions was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Variants from the IBD5 haplotype were extremely rare in the Japanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The IBD5 risk haplotype is associated with British CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Genetic variants predisposing to CD show <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> and population specific differences </plain></SENT>
