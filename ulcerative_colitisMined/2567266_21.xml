<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sigmoidoscopic appearances, rectal biopsies, and symptom and stool diary records were used to assess benefit and adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both groups showed a similar decrease in stool frequency (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proportion of unformed stools was also decreased, but to a lesser extent (p less than 0.05) in those taking olsalazine (78% v 55%; p less than 0.001) compared with those taking sulphasalazine (72% v 28%; p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a diminution in the proportion of stools containing blood in both groups (olsalazine: 61% v 22%; p less than 0.001/sulphasalazine: 67% v 37%; p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sigmoidoscopic and histological appearances and clinical activity improved significantly and to a similar extent in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intolerance was encountered in two patients on olsalazine and four on sulphasalazine; intolerance to sulphasalazine being even higher (five of seven patients) in a preliminary study using a dose of sulphasalazine releasing the same amount of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi> as 2 g olsalazine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Olsalazine was at least as effective as sulphasalazine in the treatment of new patients with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, and in a dose releasing an equivalent amount of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi> was better tolerated </plain></SENT>
