<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the role of local colonic mucosal NK receptor-positive T (NKR(+) T) cells in the regulation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp>, we analyzed the population and function of these cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Colonic mucosal tissues were obtained from colonoscopic biopsies of the descending colon from 96 patients with UC (51 endoscopically uninflamed, 45 inflamed) and 18 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic appearance and histologic score at the biopsied site were determined by Matts' classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A single cell suspension was prepared from each biopsy by collagenase digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two NKR(+) T cell subsets, CD56(+) (CD56(+)CD3(+)) T cells and CD161(+) (CD161(+)CD3(+)) T cells, were detected by flow cytometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intracellular cytokine analysis for anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) was performed by in vitro stimulation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>) and ionomycin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CD56(+) T cells and CD161(+) T cells are present in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human colon and account for 6.7% and 21.3% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mononuclear cells, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The populations of both CD56(+) T cells and CD161(+) T cells were decreased significantly in the inflamed mucosa of UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the frequency of conventional T cells (CD56(-)CD3(+) cells and CD161(-)CD3(+) cells) was similar among the patient and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The populations of NKR(+) T cells were correlated inversely with the severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, which was classified according to the endoscopic and histologic Matts' criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, approximately 4% of mucosal NKR(+) T cells expressing IL-10 were detected by in vitro stimulation with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> and ionomycin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Selective reduction in the population of colonic mucosal NKR(+) T cells may contribute to the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> in UC </plain></SENT>
