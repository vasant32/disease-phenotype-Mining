<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Biopsy specimens were taken from 17 patients with UC and seven with FAP at a median interval of 19 months (range 2-120) after ileostomy closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> contained both epithelium and lamina propria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cryostat sections were stained for lymphocyte subtypes (CD3, CD4, CD8), macrophages (CD68), common leucocyte antigen (CD45), and Ki-67, using a three stage immunoperoxidase reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytokine <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression for interleukins 2 and 6, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha, and interferon gamma was studied using an in situ hybridisation technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lymphocyte subtype and macrophage populations in epithelium and lamina propria were similar in UC and FAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The labelling index (Ki-67) was significantly increased in biopsy specimens from patients with UC (UC median = 43.3 (interquartile range (IQR) 38.9-48.2) v FAP 34.9 (29.9-35.2), p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was little or no epithelial <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression for any cytokine in any of the specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lamina propria <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression for interleukin 2 was significantly increased in UC (UC median (IQR) 10.7 (5.4-14.2) cells per unit area v FAP 2.8 (1.5-6.6) p &lt; 0.05) but not for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha, interleukin 6, and interferon gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: While static morphological assessment (leucocyte type, conventional histopathological examination) was similar, tests of cell function (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and labelling index) were different in ileal pouches in patients with UC compared with FAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The study also showed that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression occurred almost entirely in the lamina propria </plain></SENT>
