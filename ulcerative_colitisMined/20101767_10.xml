<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To establish the hospitalized prevalence of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) in Wales from 1999 to 2007; and to investigate long-term mortality after hospitalization and associations with social deprivation and other socio-demographic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Record linkage of administrative inpatient and mortality data for 1467 and 1482 people hospitalised as emergencies for &gt; or = 3 d for CD and UC, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures were hospitalized prevalence, mortality rates and standardized mortality ratios for up to 5 years follow-up after hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hospitalized prevalence was 50.1 per 100 000 population for CD and 50.6 for UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hospitalized prevalence of CD was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) in females (57.4) than in males (42.2), and was highest in people aged 16-29 years, but the prevalence of UC was similar in males (51.0) and females (50.1), and increased continuously with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hospitalized prevalence of CD was slightly higher in the most deprived areas, but there was no association between social deprivation and hospitalized prevalence of UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mortality was 6.8% and 14.6% after 1 and 5 years follow-up for CD, and 9.2% and 20.8% after 1 and 5 years for UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For both CD and UC, there was little discernible association between mortality and social deprivation, distance from hospital, urban/rural residence and geography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CD and UC have distinct demographic profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The higher prevalence of hospitalized CD in more deprived areas may reflect higher prevalence and higher hospital dependency </plain></SENT>
