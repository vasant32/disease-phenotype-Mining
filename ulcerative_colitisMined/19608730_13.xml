<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the mechanism of the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> on the regulation of epithelial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> via TGF-beta-related signaling, because the balance between the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and regeneration of epithelial cells seems to be a key factor to maintain the intestinal homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> was induced by treatment of 4% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34674">dextran sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (DSS), and the effect of treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and anti-TGF-beta antibody was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> ameliorated body <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, mucosal destruction, and epithelial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in DSS-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporine</z:chebi> was shown to upregulate the expression of TGF-beta in the colonic tissue, enhance the expression of p-Smad2 and cFLIP in epithelial cells, and inhibit caspase-8 activity but not caspase-1 or -9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Upregulation of cFLIP in the colonic epithelial cells, amelioration of body <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, and mucosal destruction by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> were attenuated by anti-TGF-beta antibody treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> could have a protective role against epithelial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> associated with upregulation of TGF-beta-related signaling </plain></SENT>
