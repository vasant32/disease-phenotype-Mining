<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is not clear which species of bacteria may be involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One way of determining which bacteria might be likely candidates is to use culture-independent methods to identify microorganisms that are present in diseased tissues but not in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: (1) To assess the diversity of microbial communities of biopsy tissue using culture-independent methods; (2) to culture the bacteria found in the tissues of patients with IBD but not in the controls; (3) to identify potential virulence factors associated with cultured bacteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 84 biopsy specimens were collected from 15 controls, 13 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and 19 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) from a population-based case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (RISA) was conducted to identify unique DNA bands in tissues from patients with CD and UC that did not appear in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RISA followed by DNA sequencing identified unique bands in biopsy specimens from patients with IBD that were classified as Escherichia coli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Targeted culture showed a significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher number of Enterobacteriaceae in specimens from patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The B2+D phylogenetic group, serine protease autotransporters (SPATE) and adherence factors were more likely to be associated with tissues from patients with UC and CD than with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The abundance of Enterobacteriaceae is 3-4 logs higher in tissues of patients with IBD and the B2+D phylogenetic groups are more prevalent in patients with UC and CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The B2+D phylogenetic groups are associated with SPATE and adherence factors and may have a significant role in disease aetiology </plain></SENT>
