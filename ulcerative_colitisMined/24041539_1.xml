<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To characterise the temporal evolution of antibodies to infliximab (ATI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective observational study of infliximab-treated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> between 2009 and 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Trough levels of infliximab and ATI were measured before each infusion by anti-λ ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were monitored for disease activity by clinical activity indexes and for dose-intensification or infliximab cessation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of transient ATI disappearing spontaneously without intervention was recorded separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 125 patients were included (98 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 27 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, median follow-up 11.5±22 months) and 1119 sera were analysed for infliximab and ATI levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that 42% of patients remained ATI-free by 4 years of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most (90%) of the patients who developed ATI did so within the first 12 months of therapy, whereas transient ATI were detected throughout the duration of infliximab therapy (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ATI incidence was similar between patients who received infliximab previously (episodic/interrupted therapy patients, n=14) and scheduled-therapy patients (n=111) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the scheduled group, combination immunomodulator+infliximab resulted in longer ATI-free survival compared with monotherapy (p=0.003, logrank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Survival free of clinical loss of response was enjoyed by 51% of patients, and serial measurements showed that ATI development often preceded the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of clinical flare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When followed prospectively, most patients who develop ATI do so within the first 12 months of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This incidence is reduced by concomitant immunomodulator even in scheduled-therapy patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In contrast, transient ATI, which are of little clinical significance, can appear haphazardly at any time during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of clinical loss of response may lag behind the appearance of anti-infliximab antibodies </plain></SENT>
