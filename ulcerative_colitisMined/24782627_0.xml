<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the relationship between the P268S, JW1 and N852S polymorphisms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) susceptibility in Zhuang patients in Guangxi, China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Intestinal tissues from 102 Zhuang [48 CD and 54 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC)] and 100 Han (50 CD and 50 UC) unrelated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> and 72 Zhuang and 78 Han unrelated healthy individuals were collected in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region from January 2009 to March 2013 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was extracted using the <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="59" ids="35255">chloroform</z:chebi> method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The P268S, JW1 and N852S polymorphisms were amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), detected by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), and verified by gene sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Heterozygous mutation of P268S in the NOD2/CARD15 gene was detected in 10 CD cases (six Zhuang and four Han), two Han UC cases, and one Zhuang healthy control, and P268S was strongly associated with the Chinese Zhuang and Han CD populations (P = 0.016 and 0.022, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No homozygous mutant P268S was detected in any of the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found in P268S genotype and allele frequencies between UC and control groups (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with CD who carried P268S were likely to be â‰¤ 40 years of age (P = 0.040), but were not significantly different with regard to race, lesion site, complications, and other clinical features (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither JW1 nor N852S polymorphisms of the NOD2/CARD15 gene were found in any of the subjects (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: P268S polymorphism may be associated with CD susceptibility in the Zhuang population in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, JW1 and N852S polymorphisms may not be related to CD susceptibility in these patients </plain></SENT>
