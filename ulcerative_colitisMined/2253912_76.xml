<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intraluminal colonic concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> were estimated after five days by the method of equilibrium in vivo dialysis of faeces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A predose serum sample and a 24 hour urine collection were obtained on day seven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27565">aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi> (Ac-5-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) values were determined by high performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Olsalazine almost doubled the colonic concentrations (mean 23.7 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) (1.9) mmol/l) of its therapeutically active ingredient (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>) compared with equimolar doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">Pentasa</z:chebi> (12.6 (2.2) mmol/l; p less than 0.0003) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">Salofalk</z:chebi> (15.0 (2.0) mmol/l; p less than 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the same time, olsalazine treatment was associated with lower serum concentrations and urinary excretions (p less than 0.05) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> and Ac-5-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> compared with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> preparations </plain></SENT>
