<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> after liver transplantation has been reported as variable with usually no change or improvement, but there may be an increased risk of early colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In many centres steroids are often withdrawn early after transplantation and this may affect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To evaluate the course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> in primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> transplant patients who were treated without long term steroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1989 and 1996, there were 30 patients transplanted for primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> who survived more than 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 18 (60%) patients before transplantation; two had previous colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent colonoscopy before and after transplantation and were followed for 38 (12-92) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> received cyclosporin or tacrolimus with or without <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> as maintenance immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> course after transplantation compared with that up to five years before transplantation was the same in eight (50%) and worse in eight (50%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It remained quiescent in eight and worsened in four of the 12 patients with pretransplant quiescent course, whereas it worsened in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients with pretransplant active course (p=0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>New <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> developed in three (25%) of the 12 patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> before transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> has been diagnosed to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Preexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> often has an aggressive course, while de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> may develop in patients transplanted for primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> and treated without long term steroids </plain></SENT>
