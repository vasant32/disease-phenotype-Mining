<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A hypothesis was proposed that P-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> is genetically determined and may represent a subclinical marker of genetic susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study analysed P-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> in monozygotic twins with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> to evaluate this hypothesis further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>P-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> was analysed with indirect immunofluorescence technique in 12 monozygotic twin pairs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 14 twin pairs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the study included 21 non-twin patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, 18 non-twin patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, and 52 healthy controls matched for sex and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> P-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> occurred in nine of 14 (64.3%) monozygotic twins and in 13 of 21 (61.9%) non-twin cases, which was significantly different compared with healthy controls who were positive in three of 52 (5.8%) cases (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>P-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> was found in two of 10 (20%) healthy twin siblings to twins with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, which was not significantly different from healthy controls (p = 0.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> did not differ from healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Previous findings of P-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> occurring in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> but not in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> are supported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study does not support the hypothesis that P-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> is a subclinical marker of genetic susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
