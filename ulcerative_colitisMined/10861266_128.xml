<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Degradation of collagens is highly regulated by a cascade of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The current study was therefore designed to determine gene expression patterns of MMPs and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) in single endoscopic biopsies of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS/METHODS: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was measured by quantitative competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in biopsies from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (n=21) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (n=21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Protein expression was analysed by western blotting and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MMP-2, MMP-14, and TIMP-1 mRNAs were marginally increased in inflamed, but 9-12-fold increased in ulcerated colonic mucosa in IBD whereas TIMP-2 mRNA expression remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNA expression correlated well with the histological degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, resulting in more than 15-fold increased MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNA levels in inflamed versus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon samples from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Profound overexpression of MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNA transcripts suggests an important role for these enzymes in the process of tissue remodelling and destruction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
