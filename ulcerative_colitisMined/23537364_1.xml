<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MDR1/ABCB1 is an interesting candidate gene for IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The role of two single nucleotide polymorphisms, C3435T and G2677T remains unclear due to contradictory results of current studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, the aims of this research were to investigate the association of MDR1 polymorphisms, C3435T and G2677T, and IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 310 IBD patients, 199 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) patients and 109 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) patients, and 120 healthy controls were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were genotyped for G2677T/A and C3435T polymorphism using RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In IBD patients, review of medical records was performed and patients were phenotyped according to the Montreal classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significantly higher frequency of 2677T allele (p=0.05; OR 1.46, 95% CI (1.0-2.14)) and of the 3435TT genotype was observed among UC patients compared to controls (p=0.02; OR 2.12; 95% CI (1.11-4.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Heterozygous carriers for C3435T were significantly less likely to have CD (p=0.02; OR 0.58, 95% CI (0.36-0.91)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis revealed that carriers of 3435T/2677T haplotype had a significantly higher risk of having UC (p=0.02; OR 1.55; 95% CI (1.06-2.28)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MDR1 polymorphisms are associated with both CD and UC with a stronger association with UC </plain></SENT>
