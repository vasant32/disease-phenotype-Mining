<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B) controls transcription of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On activation, NF kappa B is rapidly released from its cytoplasmic inhibitor (I kappa B), transmigrates into the nucleus, and binds to DNA response elements in gene promoter regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To investigate whether increased activation of NF kappa B is important in IBD and may be down-regulated by anti-inflammatory treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Activation of NF kappa B was determined by western blot assessment and electrophoretic mobility shift assay in nuclear extracts of colonic biopsy samples as well as lamina propria mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nuclear levels of NF kappa B p65 are increased in lamina propria biopsy specimens from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> in comparison with patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased activation of NF kappa B was detected in lamina propria mononuclear cells from patients with active IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">Corticosteroids</z:chebi> strongly inhibit intestinal NF kappa B activation in IBD in vivo and in vitro by stabilising the cytosolic inhibitor I kappa B alpha against activation induced degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In both IBDs, but particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, increased activation of NF kappa B may be involved in the regulation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of NF kappa B activation may represent a mechanism by which steroids exert an anti-inflammatory effect in IBD </plain></SENT>
