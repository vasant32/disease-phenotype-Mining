<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53464">MMX</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> dosed once or twice daily as maintenance therapy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This multicentre, randomised, open-label trial enrolled patients with strictly defined clinical and endoscopic remission, immediately following an episode of mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomised to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53464">MMX</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> 2.4 g/day as a single (2x1.2 g tablet) or divided dose (1x1.2 g tablet twice daily) for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 174 patients (37.9%; safety population n = 459) experienced 384 adverse events, the majority of which were mild or moderate in intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients (3.9%), nine in each group, experienced a total of 22 serious adverse events (10 in the once-daily and 12 in the twice-daily group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most serious adverse events were gastrointestinal, experienced by 5 patients in the once-daily and 4 in the twice-daily group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At month 12, 64.4% (efficacy population, n = 451) of patients in the once-daily and 68.5% of patients in the twice-daily group were in clinical and endoscopic remission (p = 0.351) </plain></SENT>
