<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Accurate diagnostic and monitoring tools for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) are missing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to describe the proteomic profile of UC and search for markers associated with disease exacerbation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we aimed to characterize specific proteins associated with inflamed colon mucosa from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> UC using mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Biopsies were sampled from rectum, sigmoid colon and left colonic flexure from twenty patients with active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033252" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">proctosigmoiditis</z:e> and from four healthy controls for proteomics and histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proteomic profiles of whole colonic biopsies were characterized using 2D-gel electrophoresis, and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> mass fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was applied for identification of differently expressed protein spots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 597 spots were annotated by image analysis and 222 of these had a statistically different protein level between inflamed and non-inflamed tissue in the patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Principal component analysis clearly grouped non-inflamed samples separately from the inflamed samples indicating that the proteomic signature of colon mucosa with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> UC is strong </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Totally, 43 individual protein spots were identified, including proteins involved in energy metabolism (triosephosphate isomerase, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi>-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase, alpha enolase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16651">L-lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase B-chain) and in <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxins</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> binding protein) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A distinct proteomic profile of inflamed tissue in UC patients was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Specific proteins involved in energy metabolism and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> were identified as potential candidate markers for UC </plain></SENT>
