<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis was examined serologically using assays with high specificity for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of intestinal resection on serum antibodies specific for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> was investigated with an immunoblot assay and an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay using the 45/48 kilodalton doublet antigen of Mycobacterium <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antibodies were detected in 64.7% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (n = 17), 10% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (n = 10), 5% of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the colon (n = 20), and none of 10 healthy subjects with the immunoblot assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical comparison of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients with each control group resulted in p = 0.0000236 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin G was essentially unchanged 75 days (mean) after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After more than 180 days, however, the antibody response was reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of five patients studied, and was no longer demonstrable in two of them (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> activity index (CDAI) decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both the high specificity of this assay for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and the diminished antibody response after intestinal resection in parallel with decreased CDAI support a mycobacterial aetiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
