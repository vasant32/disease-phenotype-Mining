<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The methodology has recently been made more specific for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> by labelling pure granulocytes rather than the mixed leucocyte preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the accuracy of this modified technique in detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, we have prospectively compared <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">Indium</z:chebi> granulocyte scanning and faecal In granulocyte excretion with rectal histology and contrast bowel radiology as screening procedures in 100 patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty three patients were shown to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> - 24 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and nine with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> or indeterminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall the respective sensitivities for detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> were 97% for faecal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">Indium</z:chebi> granulocyte excretion, 94% for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">Indium</z:chebi> granulocyte scanning, 79% for radiology and 70% for rectal histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The superiority of In granulocytes over radiology and rectal histology in detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> was, in the main, due to the difficulty in diagnosing Crohn's with conventional techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although three of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and indeterminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sigmoidoscopic appearances - <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had abnormal rectal histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patient with a non-inflammatory bowel disorder had a positive In granulocyte scan or a raised faecal excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results show that investigations using In granulocytes are accurate in identifying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> and offer important advantages over conventional procedures for detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
