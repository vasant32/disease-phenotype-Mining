<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two pathologists have independently applied 95 separate pathological criteria to 50 cases of inflammatory large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel disease</z:e> firmly diagnosed clinically as 25 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and 25 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The observer agreement in the recording of each feature has been calculated and correlations have been made between the pathological features and the final agreed diagnosis in order to obtain an estimate of the value of each feature in differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The features which have been found to be most accurately observed and useful in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> include confluent linear <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, deep fissures, an aggregated inflammatory pattern, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoid</z:e>-like granulomata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The features which have been shown to be most accurate and valuable in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> include a ;healed granular' mucosa, a continuous inflammatory pattern, an irregular gland pattern, and the absence of fissures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors consider that the use of such accurate and valuable pathological criteria in the examination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> would facilitate retrospective correlation with the clinical findings and help to clarify those intermediate cases which are at present a source of diagnostic difficulty </plain></SENT>
