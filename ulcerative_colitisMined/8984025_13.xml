<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To design a non-invasive technique for the localisation of altered gastrointestinal permeability to 51chromium labelled EDTA (51CrEDTA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The method depends on comparing and defining concentration/time profiles in serum of a series of simultaneously ingested indicators with a well defined absorption site (3-0-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4167">D-glucose</z:chebi> (jejunal indicator), 57cobalt labelled <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> (ileal indicator), and sulphasalazine (caecal-colonic indicator)) in relation to simultaneously ingested 51CrEDTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Five <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, six patients with untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coeliac disease</z:e>, five with Crohn's <z:mp ids='MP_0009482'>ileitis</z:mp>, and five with pan-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> underwent study, which entailed the simultaneous ingestion of the above four test substances followed, during the next 24 hours, by timed serial collection of urine and serum for marker analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Urinary excretion of 51CrEDTA was significantly increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of serum appearances and profiles of the markers suggested that the increased intestinal permeation of 51CrEDTA took place in the diseased jejunum in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coeliac disease</z:e>, predominantly in the ileum in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and in the colon in the patients with pan-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A new non-invasive technique has been assessed that permits the localisation of the site of permeability changes with the gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
