<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to characterise secretion of IL-8 by colonic epithelial cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Colonic crypt cells were isolated enzymatically from resected colon and the IL-8 content of culture supernates was measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rate of secretion of IL-8 accelerated and levels of IL-8 transcripts increased appreciably during culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exposure to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNF alpha) failed to increase secretion further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secretion was not induced by the enzymatic digestion or by serum used in the culture medium but was significantly inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>, by a mean of 23% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Control experiments indicated that colonic crypt cells were the likely source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The secretion of IL-8 over 24 hours by cells from uninflamed mucosa of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> was more than twofold that from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells, while that from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> bearing colons was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TNF alpha (10 mM) significantly suppressed IL-8 secretion only in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> group and the change was different to those in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (p = 0.007) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> groups (p = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cells from inflamed areas secreted more IL-8 than those from autologous uninflamed areas (p = 0.009) but responses to modulating factors were no different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The induction of IL-8 secretion by colonic crypt cells in vitro is probably a response to injury associated with isolation and culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is suppressed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> and increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> independently of the presence of mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Whether epithelial derived IL-8 plays a part in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> is not yet clear </plain></SENT>
