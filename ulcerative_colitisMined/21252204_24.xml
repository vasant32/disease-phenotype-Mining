<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Autophagy plays a prominent role in the innate immune response towards intracellular bacteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The discovery of the autophagy genes ATG16L1 and IRGM as risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> turned autophagy into the spotlight in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, NOD2 has recently been identified as a potent autophagy inducer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A physical interaction of NOD2 and ATG16L1 appears to be required for autophagic clearance of intracellular pathogens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>-associated NOD2 and ATG16L1 variants exhibit a defect in the induction of an autophagic response and hence predict autophagy as a key converging mechanism that leads to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Another pathway that is closely intertwined with autophagy and mutually cross-regulated is the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Genes involved in the UPR (XBP1, ORMDL3) have also been genetically associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the intestinal epithelium at the interface between host and microbe appears particularly affected by IBD-associated hypomorphic function of autophagy and the UPR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The functional convergence of main genetic risk factors for IBD on these innate immune pathways has hence important implications for the host's interaction with the microbiota </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the genetic convergence on these molecular mechanisms may open novel therapeutic options for IBD that deserve further exploration </plain></SENT>
