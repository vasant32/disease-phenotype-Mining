<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some 23 of 30 (77%) specimens of dysplastic tissue showed <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0004025'>polyploidy</z:mp>, whereas 50 of 53 (94%) specimens of non-dysplastic tissue showed diploidy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004025'>Polyploidy</z:mp> was often observed in non-dysplastic mucosa from patients who had <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the non-dysplastic patients <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples of inflamed tissue showed diploidy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some 10% of samples without <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, however, also showed <z:mp ids='MP_0004025'>polyploidy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A good correlation was found between the frequency of polyploid cells and the grade of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microspectrophotometric measurement of DNA content proved useful in the assessment and diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and could be considered for screening high risk patients </plain></SENT>
