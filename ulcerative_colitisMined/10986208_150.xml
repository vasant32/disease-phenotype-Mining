<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA) have been detected in a clinically distinct <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> subpopulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ASCA) have been demonstrated in the majority of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To examine the relationship between selective marker antibody expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, location, and clinical behaviour patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sera from 156 consecutive patients with established <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> were evaluated in a blinded fashion for the presence of ASCA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical profiles were generated by investigators blinded to immune marker status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using multiple regression analyses, higher ASCA levels were shown to be independently associated with early age of disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> as well as both fibrostenosing and internal penetrating disease behaviours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> levels were associated with later <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>-like behaviour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Substratification of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> population using selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> and ASCA expression (high levels of a single marker antibody): (1) distinguished homogeneous subgroups that manifested similar disease location and behaviours; and (2) identified patients with more aggressive small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that by taking into account the magnitude of the host immune response, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> can now be stratified on an immunological basis into more homogeneous clinically distinct subgroups, characterised by greater uniformity among anatomical distribution of disease and disease behaviour </plain></SENT>
