<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi> release assay was used to examine ADCC activity with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell line, colo 205, as the target and peripheral blood mononuclear cells as the effector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High ADCC activity was shown in 13 of 32 (41%) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This ADCC activity was inhibited by protein A treatment of the serum samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interleukin 2 (IL2) activated effector cells could enhance ADCC activity, but interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) had no effect on the cytotoxic activity of effector cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of target cells with IFN-gamma increased the vulnerability of these cells to ADCC with a large increase of intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression on their surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal antibodies to ICAM-1 inhibited this IFN-gamma enhanced ADCC activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> (PSL) reduced ADCC activity, but sulphasalazine (SASP) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>) did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that IL2 and IFN-gamma could enhance colonic epithelial cell injury mediated by the ADCC mechanism in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and that ADCC enhanced by cytokines is restored by PSL treatment </plain></SENT>
