<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (LE) is a newly described entity characterized histopathologically by peripapillary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo> (PL) without significant granulocytes (neutrophils and eosinophils) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an initial study, a significant portion of patients with LE had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A subsequent study revealed LE in one quarter of children with CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that LE is associated with adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) and assess the disease variables that link LE and IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Random esophageal biopsies from consecutive adults with CD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), or indeterminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (IC) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The numbers of lymphocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils were counted from 3 high-power fields (HPF) in each specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four of 47 patients (8.5%; 3/30 CD, 1/15 UC, and 0/2 IC) had PL (esophageal biopsies with ≥50 lymphocytes/HPF; mean, 100.5±31.1/HPF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant number of granulocytes were seen in biopsies from 3 of the 4 patients with PL, leaving 1 who met criteria for LE (PL without significant granulocytes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PL was associated with a higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (90.3±17.6 mm/hr vs 24.5±3.6 mm/hr; P&lt;.001) and C-reactive protein level (5.5±2.2 mg/dL vs 1.0±0.2 mg/dL; P&lt;.001), with risk ratios of 2.06 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.45-2.93; P=.031) and 3.56 (95% CI, 2.04-6.19; P=.033), respectively, for elevated values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with PL had a relapsing CD course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBI) was higher in these patients (8.5±0.6 vs 4.3±0.7; P=.026), with a risk ratio of 4.78 for moderate-to-severe disease (95% CI, 2.67-8.54; P=.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We found a less frequent association between IBD and LE than was previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This may be due to differences between pediatric and adult IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, it may be methodologic because, unlike in previous reports, we evaluated consecutive patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>PL was associated with elevated inflammatory markers and HBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that PL may be a marker of disease activity in IBD </plain></SENT>
