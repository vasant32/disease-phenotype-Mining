<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the peripheral blood there was reduced antigen induced suppression in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> in remission to Mycobacterium <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paratuberculosis</z:e>, purified protein derivative (<z:chebi fb="48" ids="51403,53543">PPD</z:chebi>), M fortuitum, and Kunin antigens (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in remission there was reduced antigen induced suppression in the peripheral blood to Kunin antigen (p less than 0.001), M avium (p less than 0.01), M nonchromogenecin, and M fortuitum (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The phenomenon of antigen induced suppression was largely CD8 dependent, as depleting CD8+ cells reduced the effect and the concentration of soluble CD8 in the culture supernatant was directly related to the suppressor index (r = 0.25, p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results are likely to be a true reflection of the cell mediated response to antigen as patients with a positive Mantoux skin test have a significantly higher suppressor index to <z:chebi fb="48" ids="51403,53543">PPD</z:chebi> than Mantoux negative subjects (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings may have significance in the aetiopathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, a similar effect could not be shown in the lamina propria lymphocytes of patients having colectomy for active disease </plain></SENT>
