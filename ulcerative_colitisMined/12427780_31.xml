<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its effect on the natural history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine whether appendicectomy reduces the overall severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Appendicectomy status and smoking habits were specified by direct interview in 638 patients seen consecutively between 1997 and 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> was assessed by reviewing therapeutic needs from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the annual incidence of flare up was assessed prospectively between 1997 and 2000 in patients who had not been colectomised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 10 year risk of colectomy was 16 (7)% in previously appendicectomised patients (n=49) compared with 33 (2)% in non-appendicectomised patients (n=589, p=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cox regression showed that previous appendicectomy and current smoking were independent factors protecting against colectomy (adjusted hazard ratio and 95% confidence intervals: 0.40 (0.20-0.78) and 0.60 (0.40-0.95), respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The respective proportions of appendicectomised and non-appendicectomised patients who required oral steroids and immunosuppressive therapy were not significantly different (67% v 70% and 27% v 19%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Between 1997 and 2000, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> was active for 48% of the time in appendicectomised patients (47 of 98 patient years) and for 62% of the time in non-appendicectomised patients (631 of 1024 patient years; p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Previous appendicectomy is associated with a less severe course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effect of appendicectomy on the risk of colectomy is additive to that of current smoking </plain></SENT>
