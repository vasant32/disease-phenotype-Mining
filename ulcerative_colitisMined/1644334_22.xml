<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 100% association with the supertypic HLA class II specificity DRw52a was recently described in white North American patients with primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp>, with or without concurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HLA class II alleles of the DR, DQ, and DP subregions were determined by genomic typing techniques in a large group of Swedish patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> as well as in a series of patients with primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant HLA class II association was observed in any of the investigated diseases or when the patients were subgrouped according to disease site or occurrence of extraintestinal manifestations, except an insignificant increase of the DRw17, DQw2 haplotype in patients with primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The failure to confirm the well established DRw17 association in Swedish patients with sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> probably represents a statistical type II error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this study did not verify the recently described strong DRw52a association in sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp>--52% of the patients were DRw52a positive compared with 28% of the controls (p less than 0.05, pc NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This discrepancy was probably caused by different typing techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The DRw52a specificity was determined directly by hybridising HLA-DRB3 genes, group specifically amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, with an allele specific oligonucleotide probe, whereas in the previously mentioned study DRw52a was assigned by indirect serological criteria, which overestimate the frequency of this allele </plain></SENT>
