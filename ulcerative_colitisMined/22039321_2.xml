<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats with 2,4,6 trinitrobenzenesulfon-ic acid (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi>)-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> received intragastric (ig) treatment with vehicle, aspirin (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) (a non-selective COX inhibitor), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> (a selective COX-2 inhibitor) or NO-releasing <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> for a period of ten days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The area of colonic lesions, colonic blood flow (CBF), myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and expression of proinflammatory markers COX-2, inducible form of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS), IL-1β and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-α were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="24364">glyceryl</z:chebi> trinitrate (GTN), a NO donor, and 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-4,4,5,5-​tetramethyl-1H-imidazolyl-1-oxy-3-<z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>, onopotassium salt (carboxy-PTIO), a NO scavenger, administered without and with <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> or NO-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>, and the involvement of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi>-sensitive afferent nerves in the mechanism of healing the experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> was also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> developed macroscopic and microscopic colonic lesions accompanied by a significant decrease in the CBF, a significant rise in colonic weight, MPO activity and plasma IL-1β and TNF-α levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These effects were aggravated by <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> and 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50127">trifluoromethyl</z:chebi>)-1H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="14973">pyrazole</z:chebi> (SC-560), but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> and counteracted by concurrent treatment with a synthetic <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> E₂ (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>₂) analog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with NO-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> dose-dependently accelerated colonic healing followed by a rise in plasma NO(x) content and CBF, suppression of MPO and downregulation of COX-2, iNOS, IL-1β and TNF-α <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with GTN, the NO donor, significantly inhibited the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>-induced colonic lesions and increased CBF, while carboxy-PTIO or <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi>-denervation counteracted the NO-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>-induced improvement of colonic healing and the accompanying increase in the CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These effects were restored by co-treatment with calcitonin gene related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CGRP) and NO-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> in <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi>-denervated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NO-releasing <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>, in contrast to <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>, COX-1 inhibitors, and SC-560, accelerated the healing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> via a mechanism involving NO mediated improvement of microcirculation and activation of sensory nerves releasing CGRP </plain></SENT>
