<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) includes two clinical subtypes: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010346" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Crohn disease</z:e> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The general prevalence is about 1.0-2.0 % in Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is predominantly regarded as a multifactorial disorder involving environmental factors and polygenic defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The view was confirmed by a lot of evidences from clinical attributions and animal models, especially from epidemiological investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>So the etiological study of IBD has been focused on searching for susceptibility genes by positional cloning, which consists of two steps: linkage analysis and association analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Linkage analysis has been an important method of searching for susceptibility genes to polygenic diseases as well as single-gene disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IBD, as a polygenic disease, has been widely investigated by linkage analysis for susceptibility gene since 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The paper reviewed 38 articles, which covered almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> original researches in relation to IBD and linkage analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>So far, several loci, such as 16q, 12q, 6p and 3p, have been identified by the studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most striking is 16q12 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBD1</z:e>), which linked only with CD not UC in the majority of studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Association analysis, as one essential step for positional cloning, is usually carried out by genotyping candidate genes selected by means of linkage analysis or other methods, for figuring out the frequencies of alleles and comparing the frequencies between IBD group and healthy control group to identify the specific allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It has been established that IBD is implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>So the studies were centered on the genes of NOD2/CARD15, HLA-II, cytokine, cytokine receptor and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This paper reviewed 14 original articles on association between NOD2 and IBD that have been published since 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> results, with the exception of one report from a Japanese group, provide evidences that the three kinds of variants of NOD2 are susceptibility factors for IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This article also comprehensively analyzed 18 original researches of HLA gene polymorphism in IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We found extensive discrepancy among the conclusions and a novel hypothesis was put forward to explain the discordance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Most studies published recently on association between IBD and cytokine gene polymorphism were reviewed </plain></SENT>
