<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Genetic variation in NOD2 has been associated with susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and specifically with ileal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reason for the unique association of NOD2 mutations with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ileal disease</z:e> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To identify a possible link, we tested expression of NOD2 in intestinal tissue of CD patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty five specimens of ileum or colon from 21 CD patients, seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) patients, and five controls with pathology other than CD or UC were stained for NOD2 using an immunoperoxidase method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using a monoclonal antibody against NOD2 developed in our laboratory, we detected uniform expression of NOD2 in terminal ileum Paneth cells from controls and patients as well as in metaplastic Paneth cells in the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mechanical purification showed enriched expression of NOD2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in ileal crypts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Paneth cells, NOD2 was located in the cytosol in close proximity to the granules that contain antimicrobial <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We detected minimal NOD2 in the villous epithelium of the ileum or in the colonic epithelium from both CD patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a role for NOD2 in the regulation of Paneth cell mediated responses against intestinal bacteria and a plausible mechanism to explain the selective association of NOD2 mutations with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ileal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The impaired capacity of CD associated mutations to sense <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> bacteria may result in increased susceptibility to certain gut microbes </plain></SENT>
