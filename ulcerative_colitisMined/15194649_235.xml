<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The recently characterised Asp299Gly polymorphism in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) receptor TLR4 is associated with impaired LPS signalling and increased susceptibility to <z:mp ids='MP_0001795'>Gram negative</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether this polymorphism was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Allele frequencies of the TLR4 Asp299Gly polymorphism and the three NOD2/CARD15 polymorphisms (Arg702Trp, Gly908Arg, and Leu1007fsinsC) were assessed in two independent cohorts of CD patients (cohort 1, n = 334; cohort 2, n = 114), in 163 UC patients, and in 140 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) was then performed on 318 inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) trios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The allele frequency of the TLR4 Asp299Gly polymorphism was significantly higher in CD (cohort 1: 11% v 5%, odds ratio (OR) 2.31 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28-4.17), p = 0.004; and cohort 2: 12% v 5%, OR 2.45 (95% CI 1.24-4.81), p = 0.007) and UC patients (10% v 5%, OR 2.05 (95% CI 1.07-3.93), p = 0.027) compared with the control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A TDT on 318 IBD trios demonstrated preferential transmission of the TLR4 Asp299Gly polymorphism from heterozygous parents to affected children (T/U: 68/34, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Carrying polymorphisms in both TLR4 and NOD2 was associated with a genotype relative risk (RR) of 4.7 compared with a RR of 2.6 and 2.5 for TLR4 and NOD2 variants separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We have reported on a novel association of the TLR4 Asp299Gly polymorphism with both CD and UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding further supports the genetic influence of PRRs in triggering IBD </plain></SENT>
