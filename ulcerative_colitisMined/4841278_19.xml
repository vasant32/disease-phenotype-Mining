<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive study of immune competence-peripheral lymphocyte count, serum immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgA and IgM), lymphocyte response to PHA, Mantoux test, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34718">DNCB</z:chebi> response-has been performed in a large number of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 52 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and 46 control patients with benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disease</z:e> were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient groups were subdivided into ;well' and ;ill' in view of the differing clinical states of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some of the Crohn's and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> patients were receiving steroid therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The peripheral blood lymphocyte count and lymphocyte response to PHA were similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum IgA levels were elevated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> but fell significantly in ;ill' Crohn's patients following excisional surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum IgM levels rose significantly in ;ill' Crohn's patients after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Steroid therapy was associated with diminution of both Mantoux and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34718">DNCB</z:chebi> responses in the ;ill' Crohn's patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of impairment of immune competence in either <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
