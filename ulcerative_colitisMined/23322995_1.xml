<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To analyze sex differences in adverse drug reactions (ADR) to the immune suppressive medication in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> IBD patients attending the IBD outpatient clinic of a referral hospital were identified through the electronic diagnosis registration system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The electronic medical records of IBD patients were reviewed and the files of those patients who have used immune suppressive therapy for IBD, i.e., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>, tacrolimus and anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor agents (anti-TNF); infliximab (IFX), adalimumab (<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>) and/or certolizumab, were further analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reported ADR to immune suppressive drugs were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The general definition of ADR used in clinical practice comprised the occurrence of the ADR in the temporal relationship with its disappearance upon discontinuation of the medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients for whom the required information on drug use and ADR was not available in the electronic medical record and patients with only one registered contact and no further follow-up at the outpatient clinic were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference in the incidence and type of ADR between male and female IBD patients were analyzed statistically by Ï‡(2) test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 1009 IBD patients were identified in the electronic diagnosis registration system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Out of these 1009 patients, 843 patients were eligible for further analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 386 males (46%), mean age 42 years (range: 16-87 years) with a mean duration of the disease of 14 years (range: 0-54 years); 578 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 244 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 21 with unclassified <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seventy percent (586 pts) of patients used any kind of immune suppressive agents at a certain point of the disease course, the majority of the patients (546 pts, 65%) used <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi>, 176 pts (21%) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, 46 pts (5%) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and one patient tacrolimus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One third (240 pts, 28%) of patients were treated with anti-TNF, the majority of patients (227 pts, 27%) used IFX, 99 (12%) used <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> and five patients certolizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between male and female patients in the use of immune suppressive agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>With regards to ADR, no differences between males and females were observed in the incidence of ADR to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Among 77 pts who developed ADR to one or more anti-TNF agents, significantly more females (54 pts, 39% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> anti-TNF treated women) than males (23 pts, 23% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> anti-TNF treated men) experienced ADR to an anti-TNF agent [P = 0.011; odds ratio (OR) 2.2, 95%CI 1.2-3.8] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The most frequent ADR to both anti-TNF agents, IFX and <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>, were allergic reactions (15% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> IFX users and 7% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients treated with <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>) and for both agents a significantly higher rate of allergic reactions in females compared with males was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>As a result of ADR, 36 patients (15% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients using anti-TNF) stopped the treatment, with significantly higher stopping rate among females (27 females, 19% vs 9 males, 9%, P = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Treatment with anti-TNF antibodies is accompanied by sexual dimorphic profile of ADR with female patients being more at risk for allergic reactions and subsequent discontinuation of the treatment </plain></SENT>
