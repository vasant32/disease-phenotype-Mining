<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A mycobacterial aetiology has been suggested for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A slow growing mycobacterium, biochemically and genetically identical to M <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paratuberculosis</z:e>, the causative agent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014335" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">enteritis</z:e> in ruminants (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Johne's disease</z:e>), has been isolated from gut specimens of patients affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If M <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paratuberculosis</z:e> or other mycobacteria play a role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, then patients may have been sensitised to these mycobacteria or show an anergy immune reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated the T-cell mediated immune response to sonicates of M <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paratuberculosis</z:e>, M kansasii, M avium, and M <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e> in 35 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 28 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and 25 controls using a macrophage inhibition factor assay on peripheral blood lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two types of reaction patterns were identified--that is, 'responders' (subjects with a macrophage inhibition factor assay in which a dose response relation was present and a percentage of inhibition exceeding 20%), and 'non-responders' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the prevalence of responders (59%-80%) and non-responders (20%-41%) to these mycobacteria between the group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found also that a large proportion of controls showed T-cell immunisation to the mycobacteria which supports the contention that the antigens are practically commensal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results do not support the proposed involvement of mycobacteria in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
