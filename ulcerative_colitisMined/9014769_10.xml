<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> are idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> (IBD) involving synthesis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23899">eicosanoids</z:chebi> from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> (AA), which is released from membrane <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A potentially important regulator of the production of these mediators is a protein activator of PLA2, referred to as PLA2 activating protein (PLAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The purpose of this investigation was to discover if PLAP values might be increased in the inflamed intestinal tissue of patients with IBD and in intestinal tissue of mice with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Biopsy specimens were taken from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> undergoing diagnostic colonoscopy, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosa was obtained from patients without IBD after surgical resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunocytochemistry with affinity purified antibodies to PLAP synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> was used to locate PLAP antigen in sections of intestinal biopsy specimens from IBD patients compared with that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intestinal tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis with a murine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">[32P]</z:chebi> labelled plap cDNA probe was performed on <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> extracted from the colons of mice fed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34674">dextran sulphate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (DSS) and cultured HT-29 cells exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PLAP antigen was localised predominantly within monocytes and granulocytes in intestinal tissue sections from IBD patients, and additional deposition of extracellular PLAP antigen was associated with blood vessels and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> fluid in the inflamed tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, tissue sections from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human intestine were devoid of PLAP reactive antigen, except for some weak cytoplasmic reaction of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> intestinal epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, colonic tissue from DSS treated mice contained an increased amount of PLAP antigen compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The stroma of the lamina propria of the colonic mucosa from the DSS treated mice reacted intensely with antibodies to PLAP synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, while no reaction was observed with control mouse colons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data were supported by northern analysis which showed that PLAP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was increased in the colons of DSS treated mice and cultured HT-29 cells exposed to LPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: As PLAP values were increased in the intestinal mucosa of IBD patients and mice with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, as well as in LPS treated cultured HT-29 cells, a role was postulated for PLAP in increasing PLA2 activity, which leads to the increased synthesis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23899">eicosanoids</z:chebi> in intestinal tissues of patients with these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
