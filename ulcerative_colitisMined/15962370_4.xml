<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Healthy adult Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats of both sexes, weighing 250-300 g, were employed in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> models were induced by 2,4,6-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48110">trinitrobenzene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29214">sulfonic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi>) enemas at a concentration of 100 mg/kg in 50% <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The experimental animals were randomly divided into <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (DX) treatment, CTG treatment, and model control groups, which were intracolicly treated daily with DX (0.2 mg/kg), CTG at doses of 2.9, 5.7 and 11.4 g crude drug/kg, and the equal amount of saline respectively from 6 h following induction of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in rats inflicted with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi> to the end of study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group of rats treated without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi> but saline enema was also included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 3 wk of treatment, the animals were assessed for colonal inflammatory and ulcerative responses with respect to mortality, frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, histology and myeloperoxidase activity (MPO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The therapeutic effect of CTG on <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) was better than DX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CTG effectively inhibited the activity of granulocytes, macrophages and monocytes in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also it reduced MPO and formation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in colonic mucosal tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, administration of CTG significantly prevented body mass loss and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and decreased frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> in UC rats, when compared with the model control group rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CTG would prove to be an ideal drug for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> UC, and is warranted to be studied further </plain></SENT>
