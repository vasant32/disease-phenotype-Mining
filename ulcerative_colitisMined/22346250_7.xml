<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients in remission or with mild-to-moderate disease activity completed the <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> questionnaire (FQ), the rating form of IBD patient concerns (RFIPC), the Short-Form 36 (SF-36), and IBD questionnaire (N-IBDQ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, clinical and epidemiological data were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 140 patients were included; of which 92 were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 48 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> was 44.2 years (SD = 15.8) and for non-fatigued patients was 44.7 years (SD = 16.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> fatigued patients had clinically significantly increased levels of disease-related worries, as measured by Cohen's d effect size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Worries about having an ostomy bag, loss of bowel control, and energy levels were most prominent in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> fatigued and non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> fatigued IBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Variance inflation factor (VIF) and tolerance indicated that there were no problematic multicolinearity among the FQ, RFIPC, SF-36 and N-IBDQ responses (VIF &lt; 5 and tolerance &gt; 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> is associated with increased levels of disease-related worries and concerns in IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased levels of worries were also associated with impaired health-related quality of life </plain></SENT>
