<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To produce an antibody against rat eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and to examine the effects of the antibody in rats with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34674">dextran sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (DSS)-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An antibody was raised against rat ECP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were treated with 3% DSS in drinking water for 7 d and received the antibody or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The colons were examined histologically and correlated with clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis were estimated as a grade of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ECP antibody stained the activated eosinophils around the injured crypts in the colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antibody treatment reduced the severity of colonic ulceration and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> clinical symptoms (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> and/or blood-stained stool) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Body <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> was significantly greater and the colon length was significantly longer in anti-ECP-treated rats than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression of ECP in activated eosinophils was associated with the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number of Ki-67-positive cells in the regenerated surface epithelium increased in anti-ECP-treated rats compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis revealed reduced expression of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in anti-ECP-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that treatment with ECP antibody, improved DSS-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in rats, possibly by increasing the regenerative activity of the colonic epithelium and downregulation of the immune response, and suggest that anti-ECP may promote intestinal wound healing in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
