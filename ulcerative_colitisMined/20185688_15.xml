<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endomicroscopy has been demonstrated to reveal histological information in a multitude of diseases in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most studies have focused on <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, or colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endomicroscopy allows obtainment of "smart," targeted biopsies from regions with microscopic alterations rather than having to rely on random untargeted tissue sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This reduces the number of biopsies while increasing the diagnostic yield </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, immediate histological information is available, enabling immediate therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Apart from morphological visualization, endomicroscopy offers a unique possibility to study pathophysiological events in their natural environment (functional imaging) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Molecular imaging with endomicroscopy applied in clinical and basic science will permit advances in understanding of the cellular basis of gastrointestinal <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> and pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
