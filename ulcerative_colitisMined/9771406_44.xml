<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) synthesis and inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) expression are increased in colonic biopsy specimens from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, but the cellular source of NO production is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To examine the distribution of iNOS in human colonic mucosa and to explore the ability of T lymphocyte derived cytokines to regulate iNOS expression and activity in human colonic epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: iNOS expression was examined using immunohistochemistry in colonic biopsy samples from 12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and three with infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and compared with 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vitro iNOS expression and activity were determined in HT-29 cell cultures; <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> levels were measured using a fluorescent substrate, iNOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression by northern blot analysis, and iNOS protein expression by western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No iNOS expression was detected (10 of 10) in non-inflamed mucosa derived from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 11 of 12 cases of newly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, iNOS protein was expressed in the epithelial cells, while no other positive cells were found in the lamina propria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar iNOS labelling was found in colonic biopsy samples from patients with infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, but when re-examined in samples from patients in total remission, no iNOS staining was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both interleukin (IL)-13 and IL-4, but not IL-10, are potent inhibitors of iNOS expression and activity induced by an optimal combination of cytokines, namely IL-1 alpha, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha and interferon gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the epithelium is the major source of iNOS activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and that IL-13 and IL-4 may act as intrinsic regulators of NO generation in <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
