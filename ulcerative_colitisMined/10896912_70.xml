<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> receptor (VDR) gene represents a strong positional candidate susceptibility gene for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The VDR gene maps to a region on chromosome 12 that has been shown to be linked to IBD by genome screening techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is the cellular receptor for 1,25<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29191">(OH)</z:chebi>(2) <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>(3) (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17823">calcitriol</z:chebi>) which has a wide range of different regulatory effects on the immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IBD is characterised by activation of the mucosal immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine if polymorphisms in the VDR gene are associated with susceptibility to IBD SUBJECTS: European Caucasoids: 158 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, 245 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, and 164 cadaveric renal allograft donor controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (TaqI, ApaI, and FokI) in VDR were typed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and controls by polymerase chain reaction with sequence specific primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were significantly more homozygotes for the TaqI polymorphism at codon 352 of exon 8 (genotype "tt") among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (frequency 0.22) than patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (0.12) or controls (0.12) (odds ratio 1.99; 95% confidence interval 1.14-3.47; p=0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary evidence for a genetic association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> susceptibility and a gene that lies within one of the candidate regions determined by linkage analysis </plain></SENT>
