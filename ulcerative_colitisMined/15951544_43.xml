<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A phase IIA, double blind, randomised, placebo controlled study was performed in 60 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> active, non steroid dependent, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, with a clinical activity index (CAI) of &gt; or = 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Retarded release <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> rich <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and placebo were administered at a dose of 6 g daily over three months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was a change in CAI towards clinical remission (CAI &lt; or = 3) or CAI improvement by &gt; or = 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points included &gt; or = 50% changes in endoscopic activity index (EAI), histology, and quality of life scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Induction of clinical remission (CAI &lt; or = 3) as the primary outcome variable was attained by 16 (53%) patients in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> treated group compared with three (10%) in the placebo group (p&lt;0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of clinical remission and CAI improvement was 90% in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> group and only 10% in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A median drop of seven points in the CAI score (70% improvement) was recorded in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> group compared with no change in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Secondary end point analysis revealed concomitant drops in EAI and histology scores (p = 0.00016 and p = 0.0067 compared with placebo, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Improvement in quality of life was reported by 16 of 29 evaluated patients in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> group compared with two of 30 in the placebo group (p = 0.00005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Retarded release oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> is effective in alleviating inflammatory activity caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
