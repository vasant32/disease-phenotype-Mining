<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> is pivotal for ongoing clinical management decisions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have compared the diagnostic yield of endomicroscopy with conventional "white light" endoscopy and hence the overall objective increase of endomicroscopy targeted biopsies as compared to chromoscopy guided alone is not apparent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We performed a prospective randomised controlled study to compare the diagnostic yield of intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in patients undergoing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> screening using chromoscopy assisted endomicroscopy (group A) versus pan-colonic chromoscopy assisted colonoscopy (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to undergo screening colonoscopy using either chromoscopic endomicroscopy or chromoscopy alone with targeted biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Circumscribed lesions were characterised using endomicroscopy and chromoscopy with pit pattern analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Targeted biopsies in addition to conventional 10 cm quadrantic biopsies were taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome addressed the number of intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> detected in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endomicroscopy targeted biopsies significantly increased the yield of intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> as compared to pan-chromoscopy and biopsy alone (p&lt;0.001) and also increased the yield of high-grade dysplastic lesions (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Endomicroscopy targeted biopsies increased the diagnostic yield of intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> as compared to chromoscopy guided biopsies alone by 2.5-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first randomised controlled study to show the true clinical benefit of endomicroscopy for the in vivo detection and characterisation of intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> surveillance colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Endomicroscopy with targeted biopsy may potentially be the "gold standard" for the detection of intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
