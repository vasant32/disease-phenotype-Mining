<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A systematic literature search of MEDLINE (1950-Oct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2009) and EMBASE (1980-Oct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2009) was conducted to identify studies investigating the relationship between urban environment and IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cohort and case-control studies were analyzed using incidence rate ratio (IRR) or odds ratio (OR) with 95â€‰% confidence intervals (CIs), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stratified and sensitivity analyses were performed to explore <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> between studies and assess effects of study quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The search strategy retrieved 6940 unique citations and 40 studies were selected for inclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, 25 investigated the relationship between urban environment and UC and 30 investigated this relationship with CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Included in our analysis were 7 case-control UC studies, 9 case-control CD studies, 18 cohort UC studies and 21 cohort CD studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on a random effects model, the pooled IRRs for urban compared to rural environment for UC and CD studies were 1.17 (1.03, 1.32) and 1.42 (1.26, 1.60), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These associations persisted across multiple stratified and sensitivity analyses exploring clinical and study quality factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneity</z:hpo> was observed in the cohort studies for both UC and CD, whereas statistically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was not observed for the case-control studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A positive association between urban environment and both CD and UC was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneity</z:hpo> may be explained by differences in study design and quality factors </plain></SENT>
