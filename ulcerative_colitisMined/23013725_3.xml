<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the contribution of intestinal IgG plasma cells to UC pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We isolated lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs) from intestinal mucosa of UC patients and analysed the characteristics of intestinal plasma cells (expression profiles of differentiation molecules and chemokine receptors) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the involvement of IgG-immune complex (IC)-Fc gamma receptor (FcγR) signalling in <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> by examining the cytokine production by LPMCs in response to IgG-IC stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IgG plasma cells that were markedly increased in number in the inflamed mucosa of UC patients showed a distinct expression profile (CD19(+)CD27(low), CCR10(low)CXCR4(high)) compared with IgA plasma cells (CD19(+/-)CD27(high), CCR10(high)CXCR4(-/low)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro IgG-IC stimulation activated intestinal CD14 macrophages that were increased in number in the inflamed mucosa of UC patients via FcγRI and FcγRII, and induced the extensive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), comparable to the effect of commensal bacteria stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Co-stimulation with IgG-IC and commensal bacteria increased TNF and IL-1β production more than stimulation with the latter alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, IgG-IC notably up-regulated the expression of TL1A, whereas commensal bacteria specifically induced IL-23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these results demonstrate a novel aspect of UC pathogenesis in which unique IgG plasma cells infiltrate the inflamed mucosa via CXCR4, and critically influence UC pathogenesis by exacerbating mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> through the activation of 'pathogenic' intestinal CD14 macrophages via IgG-IC-FcγR signalling </plain></SENT>
