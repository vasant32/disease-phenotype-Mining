<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In active <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, a very low transmucosal pd was found and was associated with loss of the characteristic ability of the mucosa to absorb <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> against considerable electrochemical gradients; a marked increase in the plasma-to-lumen <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> flux rate, suggesting increased leakiness of the mucosa; and loss of the active <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> absorption mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In resolving <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, the pd was higher and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these changes of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> transport tended to return towards <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
