<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Excessive mucosal generation of cytokines and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23899">eicosanoids</z:chebi> has been reported in vitro in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) using traumatising biopsy techniques, and in vivo using time consuming rectal dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To validate a simple filter paper technique to profile rectal mucosal production of cytokines and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23899">eicosanoids</z:chebi> in vivo in patients with UC compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Forty one patients with UC (21 with active disease) and 16 controls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In vitro, recovery of known concentrations of cytokine or mediator applied to filter papers was measured by ELISA following incubation in buffer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vivo, patients and controls had filter papers apposed to the rectal mucosa briefly through a rigid sigmoidoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Filter papers were then incubated prior to assay by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In vitro validation studies showed that the filter paper technique could be used to measure mucosal release of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNF-alpha), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> B(2) (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26996">TXB</z:chebi>(2)), and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> E(2) (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2)), but not interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mucosal release of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26996">TXB</z:chebi>(2) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) were significantly increased in active UC (p=0.001) and correlated directly with disease activity (p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The filter paper technique confirmed increased rectal mucosal release of cytokines and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23899">eicosanoids</z:chebi> in UC, in proportion to disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The simplicity, safety and speed of the technique make it a practicable option for use in the outpatient clinic to study the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, and potentially its response to treatment </plain></SENT>
