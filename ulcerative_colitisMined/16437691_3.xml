<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the plasma <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (vWF) levels in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and to investigate their relationship with disease activity, systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and coagulation activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 46 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (active in 34 patients), clinical data were gathered and plasma vWF levels, markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (ESR, CRP, and fibrinogen) and thrombin generation (TAT, F1+2, and D-dimers) were measured at baseline and after 12 wk of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma vWF levels were also determined in 52 healthy controls (HC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationship of plasma vWF levels with disease activity, disease extent, response to therapy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase reactants (APRs) and coagulation markers (COAGs) was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean plasma vWF concentrations were significantly higher in active UC patients (143.38+/-63.73%) than in HC (100.75+/-29.65%, P = 0.001) and inactive UC patients (98.92+/-43.6%, P = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ESR, CRP and fibrinogen mean levels were significantly higher in active UC patients than in inactive UC patients, whereas there were no significant differences in plasma levels of D-dimers, F1+2, and TAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>UC patients with raised APRs had significantly higher mean plasma vWF levels than those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> APRs (144.3% vs 96.2%, P = 0.019), regardless of disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the mean plasma vWF levels were higher in UC patients with raised COAGs than in those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> COAGs, irrespective of disease activity, the difference was not significant (141.3% vs 118.2%, P = 0.216) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No correlation was noted between plasma vWF levels and disease extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 12 wk of treatment, significant decreases of fibrinogen, ESR, F1+2, D-dimers and vWF levels were noted only in UC patients with clinical and endoscopic improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that increased plasma vWF levels correlate with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Elevated plasma vWF levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> possibly reflect an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase response of the perturbed endothelium due to <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In UC patients, plasma vWF levels may be another useful marker of disease activity or response to therapy </plain></SENT>
