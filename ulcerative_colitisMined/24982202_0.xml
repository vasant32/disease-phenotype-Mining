<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate molecular profiles in the small bowel (SB) mucosa proximal to the pouch in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) patients after pouch surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Patients were prospectively recruited and stratified according to disease behaviour: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pouch (NP), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> (CP), and Crohn's-like disease of the pouch (CLDP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biopsies obtained from the pouch and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing proximal SB (40 cm proximal to the anal verge) were compared to ileal biopsies from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (NC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A histopathological score based on the degree of polymorphonuclear and mononuclear infiltrates was used to assess <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the pouch and the proximal SB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene expression analysis was performed using microarrays, and validated by real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gene ontology and clustering were evaluated by bioinformatics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-six subjects were recruited (age 18-71 years, 16 males) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histopathology scores demonstrated minimal differences in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing proximal SB of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, significant (fold change ≥2, corrected p [FDR] ≤ 0.05) molecular alterations in the proximal SB were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups (NP n=9; CP n=80; and CLDP n=230) compared with NC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of DUOX2 alteration in the proximal SB was highest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An increase of 6.0, 9.8 and 21.7 folds in DUOX2 expression in NP, CP, CLDP, respectively was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This was followed by alterations in MMP1, SLC6A14 and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Gene alterations in the proximal SB overlapped with alterations within the pouch (76% and 97% overlap in CP and CLDP, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Gene ontology analysis in the proximal SB and pouch were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Significant gene expression alterations exist in an apparently unaffected proximal SB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Alterations in the pouch and the proximal SB were comparable, suggesting that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> may not be limited to the pouch, but that it extends to the proximal SB </plain></SENT>
