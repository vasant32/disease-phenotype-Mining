<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The only event which occurred significantly more often in patients who subsequently relapsed was ingestion of <z:chebi fb="58" ids="46195">paracetamol</z:chebi> and other inhibitors of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> synthesis (76% (16/21) relapse vs 39% (24/62) remission, p less than 0  </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent upper <z:hpo ids='HP_0011947'>respiratory tract infection</z:hpo> (38% vs 26%) was not significantly more common in patients in relapse than in remission, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086209" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">emotional stress</z:e>, atopic events, antibiotic treatment, dietary indiscretions, foreign travel, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017160" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastroenteritis</z:e> were relatively rare in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The surprisingly high prevalence of <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> ingestion before relapse itself requires confirmation but does lend indirect support to the theory that colonic mucosal <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> deficiency induces relapse in some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
