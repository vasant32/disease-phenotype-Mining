<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regulation of colon <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> by this receptor has been well demonstrated in many experimental models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> but also in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, characterised by impaired expression of PPARgamma confined to their colon epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent data showing that PPARgamma was the major functional receptor mediating the common aminosalicylate activities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> (IBD) have also reinforced the roles of this receptor in the control of <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aims of this review are to discuss the potential roles of PPARgamma in the physiopathology of IBD, as well as the emerging therapeutic strategies targeting this receptor </plain></SENT>
