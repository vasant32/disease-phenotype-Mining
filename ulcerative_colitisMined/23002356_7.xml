<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The recommendations of numerous consensus groups worldwide are now supported by a wealth of clinical trials and several meta-analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In general, it is suggested that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α blockers (TNFBs) are indicated (1) for persons with moderately-severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) who have failed two or more causes of glucocorticosteroids and an acceptably long cause (8 wk to 12 wk) of an immune modulator such as <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>; (2) non-responsive perianal disease; and (3) severe UC not responding to a 3-d to 5-d course of steroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Once TNFBs have been introduced and the patient is responsive, therapy given by the IV and SC rate must be continued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It remains open to definitive evidence if concomitant immune modulators are required with TNFB maintenance therapy, and when or if TNFB may be weaned and discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The supportive evidence from a single study on the role of early versus later introduction of TNFB in the course of a patient's illness needs to be confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk/benefit profile of TNFB appears to be acceptable as long as the patient is immunized and tested for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006562'>viral hepatitis</z:hpo> before the initiation of TNFB, and as long as the long-term adverse effects on the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> do not prone to be problematic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because the rates of benefits to TNFB are modest from a population perspective and the cost of therapy is very high, the ultimate application of use of TNFBs will likely be established by cost/benefit studies </plain></SENT>
