<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence suggests that the abnormality of innate and adaptive immunity responses plays an important role in <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IBD including <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> of the gastrointestinal tract, which is implicated in an inappropriate and overactive mucosal immune response to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> flora </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Traditionally, CD is regarded as a Th1-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorder</z:e> while UC is regarded as a Th2-like disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recently, Th17 cells were identified as a new subset of T helper cells unrelated to Th1 or Th2 cells, and several cytokines [e.g. interleukin (IL)-21, IL-23] are involved in regulating their activation and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They not only play an important role in host defense against extracellular pathogens, but are also associated with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> such as IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The identification of Th17 cells helps us to explain some of the anomalies seen in the Th1/Th2 axis and has broadened our understanding of the immunopathological effects of Th17 cells in the development of IBD </plain></SENT>
