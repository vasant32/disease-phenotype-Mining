<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of action is unknown but may involve improved intracellular energy production as previous evidence indicates that colonocyte oxidation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> is impaired in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No information is, however, available on human mucosal metabolism of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17272">propionate</z:chebi> in either health or disease or the Vmax and Km values of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to assess the kinetic parameters, Vmax and Km, of the complete oxidation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26666">short chain fatty acids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> by human colonocytes and to explore whether a metabolic abnormality could be confirmed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colonocytes were isolated from surgical specimens obtained from 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and eight control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incubations were performed in the presence of a concentration range of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-labelled <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17272">propionate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Oxidation rates were obtained by quantifying the production of 14CO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vmax and Km were calculated by computer fitting of the data to a Michaelis-Menten plot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were shown in either Vmax or Km values of any of the SCFAs or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> comparing controls and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comparing the results obtained regarding the individual SCFAs, the most striking difference was the considerably lower Km value of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The apparent Vmax of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> tended to be higher than Vmax of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17272">propionate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Vmax of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation was significantly lower compared with the Vmax values of SCFA oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The study shows the ability of isolated human colonocytes to utilise each of the three major SCFAs, but does not support a pathogenic role for defective metabolism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The considerably lower Km of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> oxidation supports a specific role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> as an energy source for the colonic mucosa in both health and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
