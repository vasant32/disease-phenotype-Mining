<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>If skilled histopathologists disagree over the same biopsy specimen, at least one must have an incorrect interpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, disagreement is associated with, although not the cause of, diagnostic error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to determine the magnitude of variation among 10 observers with a special interest in gastrointestinal histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They independently interpreted the same biopsy specimens for morphological features which may discriminate between patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty of 41 features had agreement measures significantly better than expected by chance (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The range of agreement in the 45 observer pairs over the final diagnosis was 65-76% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was good agreement in discriminating between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> slides and those showing confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> slides, however, the term nonspecific <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was often applied and without any consistency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, true <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> slides were often and consistently thought to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Having identified 11 important discriminatory morphological features, two multiple regression analyses were then carried out to produce a scoring system for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest there is considerable room for improvement in the reliability of colonic biopsy specimen interpretation and that this could probably be achieved using more exact definitions of morphological features and diseases </plain></SENT>
