<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The incidence of Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (CDI) is 1.8%-5.7% in admitted patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CDI can worsen UC and increase the risk for colectomy or even <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, thus necessitating therapy escalation, such as increasing the corticoid therapy or starting a biologic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several reported cases with infliximab therapy have provided favorable outcomes in UC patients with CDI, suggesting that infliximab treatment may be protective; however, the optimal infliximab treatment regimen for UC patients with CDI remains to be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we report a case of worsening UC in the presence of recurrent CDI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient had received prior ciprofloxacin and immunosuppressive therapy during a prolonged hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The deterioration in the patient's condition likely resulted from the ability of C. difficile to promote relapsing of UC by activating the immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ultimately, the patient was treated with a high dose of infliximab after a low trough level of infliximab at week 8 was identified, yielding better clinical results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Infliximab was found to be safe after repetitive episodes of CDI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The trough level of infliximab was therefore a useful indicator to guide therapy and correlated well with the patient's outcome </plain></SENT>
