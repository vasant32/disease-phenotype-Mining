<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with extensive or complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) at diagnosis should be treated straightaway with immunosuppressive therapy according to the most recent guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with localized and uncomplicated CD at diagnosis, early use of immunosuppressive therapy is debated for preventing disease progression and limiting the disabling clinical impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this context, there is a need for predictors of benign or unfavourable subsequent clinical course, in order to avoid over-treating with risky drugs those patients who would have experienced spontaneous mid-term asymptomatic disease without progression towards irreversible intestinal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis, an age below 40 years, the presence of perianal lesions and the need for treating the first flare with steroids have been consistently associated with an unfavourable subsequent 5-year or 10-year clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value of unfavourable course in patients with 2 or 3 predictors ranges between 0.75 and 0.95 in population-based and referral centre cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the use of these predictors can be integrated into the elements that influence individual decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the CD postoperative context, keeping smoking and history of prior resection are the strongest predictors of disease symptomatic recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, these clinical predictors alone are not as reliable as severity of early postoperative endoscopic recurrence in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> at diagnosis is associated with unfavourable clinical course in the first 5 to 10 years of the disease, and also with long-term colectomy and colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with extensive UC at diagnosis, a rapid step-up strategy aiming to achieve sustained deep remission should therefore be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the moment, no reliable serological or genetic predictor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> clinical course has been identified </plain></SENT>
