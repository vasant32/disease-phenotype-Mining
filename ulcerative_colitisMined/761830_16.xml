<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Animals were first immunised with the common enterobacterial antigen of Kunin and haemagglutinating antibodies demonstrated in high titre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An immune complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> was then established by the injection of soluble immune complexes following mild irritation of the rectum with dilute formalin as previously described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rabbits developed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0100282'>acute colitis</z:hpo> within the first week but, in contrast with unsensitised rabbits, the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> persisted and was still present at six months as assessed by proctoscopy and rectal biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Kunin-sensitised rabbits receiving intravenous saline, antigen, or antibody alone did not develop a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100281'>chronic colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that hypersensitivity to colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> antigens may be one mechanism whereby an <z:hpo ids='HP_0100282'>acute colitis</z:hpo> becomes <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
