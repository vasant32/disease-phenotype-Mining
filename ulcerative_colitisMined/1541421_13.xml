<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied the functional characteristics and clinical importance of the natural killer (NK) cytotoxicity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> NK activity was observed in PBMNC from patients with inactive disease, but a pronounced decrease was found in those with active disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical change from active to inactive disease was associated with enhancement of the depressed NK activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The impairment of NK cytotoxicity found in patients with active disese could not be ascribed to a deficient number of NK cells as the amounts of HNK-1+, CD16+ (Leu 11), and CD11b (OKM1) cells in PBMNC were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ranges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This defective cytotoxic PBMNC activity was normalised by short term (18 hour) incubation with recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, long term (5 day) incubation of these effector cells with rIL-2 induced strong cytotoxic activity against NK resistant and NK sensitive target cells in patients with active and inactive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also found that both precursors and effectors of cytotoxic activity promoted by short term and long term incubation with rIL-2 of PBMNC from the patients showed the phenotype of NK cells (CD16+, CD3-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results show that active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> is associated with a defective function of NK cells that is found to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the inactive stage of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The possible pathogenic and therapeutic implications of these findings are discussed </plain></SENT>
