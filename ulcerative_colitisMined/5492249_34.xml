<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Vascular changes were seen in specimens with lesions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> as well as in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, the vasculature in the bowel wall was rearranged secondary to thickening of the intestinal coats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An anatomical relationship was often found between the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> and the point where arteries break through the muscularis propria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The vasculature was markedly increased in areas with deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> and transmural <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, but in areas with only small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> and mild inflammatory reaction vascular changes were barely discernible or absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Occlusive vascular changes were uncommon and not visible in the radiographs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> hypervascularity was more marked than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, but was confined to the mucosa and adjacent parts of the submucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In ;burnt-out' <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> vascularity was not increased and only minor changes in the submucosal arteries were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The observations did not suggest that the vascular alterations are of primary importance for the formation of lesions in either disease </plain></SENT>
