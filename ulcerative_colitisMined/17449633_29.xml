<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIM: Interleukin 31 (IL31), primarily expressed in activated lymphocytes, signals through a heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of the IL31 receptor alpha (IL31Ralpha) and the oncostatin M receptor (OSMR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyse IL31 receptor expression, signal transduction, and specific biological functions of this cytokine system in <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Expression studies were performed by RT-PCR, quantitative PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Signal transduction was analysed by western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation was measured by MTS assays, cell migration by restitution assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> derived intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) lines express both IL31 receptor subunits, while their expression in unstimulated primary murine IEC was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LPS and the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL1beta, IFN-gamma, and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> stimulation increased IL31, IL31Ralpha, and OSMR <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, while IL31 itself enhanced IL8 expression in IEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IL31 mediates ERK-1/2, Akt, STAT1, and STAT3 activation in IEC resulting in enhanced IEC migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, at low cell density, IL31 had significant antiproliferative capacities (p&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IL31 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was not increased in the TNFDeltaARE mouse model of <z:mp ids='MP_0009482'>ileitis</z:mp> but in inflamed colonic lesions compared to non-inflamed tissue in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD; average 2.4-fold increase) and in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC; average 2.6-fold increase) and correlated with the IL-8 expression in these lesions (r = 0.564 for CD; r = 0.650 for UC; total number of biopsies analysed: n = 88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IEC express the functional IL31 receptor complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IL31 modulates cell proliferation and migration suggesting a role in the regulation of intestinal barrier function particularly in <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
