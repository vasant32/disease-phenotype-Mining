<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Smoking is a major environmental factor that interferes in the establishment and clinical course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Firstly, the risk of smoking status impact in the development of UC is reviewed, showing that current smoking has a protective association with UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similarly, being a former smoker is associated with an increased risk of UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The concept that smoking could have a role in determining the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> phenotype is also discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gender may also be considered, as current smoking delays disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in men but not in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No clear conclusions can be driven from the studies trying to clarify whether childhood passive smoking or prenatal smoke exposure have an influence on the development of UC, mainly due to methodology flaws </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The influence of smoking on disease course is the second aspect analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some studies show a disease course more benign in smokers that in non-smokers, with lower hospitalizations rates, less flare-ups, lower use of oral steroids and even less risk of proximal extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is not verified by some other studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the rate of colectomy does not seem to be determined by the smoking status of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The third issue reviewed is the use of <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> as a therapeutic agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The place of <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> in the treatment of UC is unclear, although it could be useful in selected cases, particularly in recent ex-smokers with moderate but refractory attacks of UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Finally, the effect of smoking cessation in UC patients is summarised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Given that smoking represents a major worldwide cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, for inpatients with UC the risks of smoking far outweigh any possible benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thus, physicians should advise, encourage and assist UC patients who smoke to quit </plain></SENT>
