<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> characterised by a Th1 immune response, remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Osteopontin (OPN) is a phosphoprotein known as an adhesive bone matrix protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that OPN plays an important role in lymphocyte migration, granuloma formation, and interleukin 12 (IL-12) production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated expression and the pathophysiological role of OPN in CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma OPN concentration was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of OPN in human intestinal mucosa was determined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot, and localisation of OPN was examined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of integrin beta3, an OPN receptor, on lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) was assessed by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Functional activation of OPN in LPMC was investigated by measuring the production of cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma OPN concentration was significantly higher in patients with CD compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls or patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>OPN was upregulated in intestinal mucosa from UC and CD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>OPN producing cells were epithelial or IgG producing plasma cells, or partial macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>OPN was detected in areas surrounding granuloma from mucosa in CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Integrin beta3 expressing macrophages infiltrated inflamed mucosa in UC and CD; in contrast, there was no expression of integrin beta3 on intestinal macrophages in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>OPN induced production of IL-12 from LPMC in CD but not in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls or UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased OPN expression facilitates cytokine production and is closely involved in the Th1 immune response associated with CD </plain></SENT>
