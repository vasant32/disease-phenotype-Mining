<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Studies document increasing rates of hospitalization among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, but temporal trends for in-hospital mortality among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> are not characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether in-hospital mortality changed over a 13-year period among nationwide hospitalizations associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We additionally sought to identify factors correlated with mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the National Hospital Discharge Survey, a large nationally representative database, for the years 1994 through 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age- and mortality-adjusted rates of in-hospital mortality and standardized mortality ratios were calculated for four time periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis was used to assess associations between advancing time and mortality in adjusted analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 150 (0.9%) of 17,393 hospitalizations for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> ended in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age-adjusted in-hospital mortality decreased from 3.6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> per 1,000 hospital days in 1994-96 to 2.4 per 1,000 in 2003-06; standardized mortality ratio decreased from 0.33 to 0.27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar trends were seen for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, but mortality did not change over time among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariable logistic regression analysis confirmed the significance of these changes in mortality, with 17% decreased odds of in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> per three-year period (P=0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subject age (OR 1.06 per year, P&lt;0.001), Charlson comorbidity index (OR 1.29 per 1-point increase, P&lt;0.001), and diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (versus <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, OR 1.41, P=â€‰.042) were also associated with in-hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The odds of in-hospital mortality among hospitalized patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> decreased by 17% per 3-year period from 1994 to 2006 in analysis adjusted for age and comorbidity status, in this large, nationally representative database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multiple factors likely contribute to these trends </plain></SENT>
