<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The object of this study was to examine the magnitude and location of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS) activity and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> formation in the colonic mucosa of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in relation to the degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Thirty three patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (17 with mild or moderate <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, 16 with severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Inducible NOS activity was determined in the colonic mucosa by measuring the conversion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18211">citrulline</z:chebi> in the absence of calcium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The localisation of NOS and nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity was assessed immunohistochemically using the labelled streptavidin <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Inducible NOS activity increased in parallel with the degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of the mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of inducible NOS was found not only in the lamina propria, but also in the surface of the epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">Peroxynitrite</z:chebi> formation as assessed by nitrotyrosine staining was frequently observed in the lamina propria of actively inflamed mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> formation may play an important role in causing irreversible cellular injury to the colonic mucosa in patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
