<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate intestinal alkaline phosphatase (iAP) in the intestinal mucosa of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Colonic biopsy samples were taken from 15 newly diagnosed IBD patients and from 10 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In IBD patients, specimens were obtained both from inflamed and non-inflamed areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The iAP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting analysis, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue localization of iAP and Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 was investigated by immunofluorescent staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The iAP protein level in the inflamed mucosa of children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) was significantly decreased when compared with controls (both P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, we found a significantly decreased level of iAP protein in the inflamed mucosa in CD compared with non-inflamed mucosa in CD (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the iAP protein level in inflamed colonic mucosa in patients with UC was decreased compared with non-inflamed mucosa in patients with CD (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>iAP protein levels in the non-inflamed mucosa of patients with CD were similar to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>iAP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in inflamed colonic mucosa of children with CD and UC was not significantly different from that in non-inflamed colonic mucosa with CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Expression of iAP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in patients with non-inflamed mucosa and in controls were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Co-localization of iAP with TLR4 showed intense staining with a dotted-like pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>iAP was present in the inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa of patients with CD, UC, and in control biopsy specimens, irrespective of whether it was present in the terminal ileum or in the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the fluorescent signal of TLR4 was more pronounced in the colon compared with the terminal ileum in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Lower than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> iAP protein levels in inflamed mucosa of IBD patients may indicate a role for iAP in inflammatory lesions in IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Based on our results, administration of exogenous iAP enzyme to patients with the active form of IBD may be a therapeutic option </plain></SENT>
