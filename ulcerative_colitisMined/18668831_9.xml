<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a therapeutic trial cholestyramine had no beneficial effect on the general condition, diarrhoea, or faecal composition, findings which further strengthen the view that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi> play no role in the diarrhoea of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, provided that the disease is limited to the large bowel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Faecal elimination of cholesterol as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi> and neutral steroids tended initially to be higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but increased less than in controls during treatment with cholestyramine, particularly in the heavier patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum cholesterol was low in the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and decreased by cholestyramine less (27%) than in controls (39%) </plain></SENT>
