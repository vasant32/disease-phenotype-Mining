<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in helper or suppressor cell proportions among 15 steroid treated patients with active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, 10 patients with inactive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, 10 patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal diseases</z:e>, or 12 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 15 patients with active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> not treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> manifested increased proportions of helper cells and decreased proportions of suppressor cells (p less than 0.001), compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other patient groups and to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When absolute numbers of helper and suppressor subsets were measured, these alterations in proportions of helper and suppressor cells were primarily attributable to decreased counts of suppressor T-cells both in patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In four patients undergoing serial study, the helper/suppressor ratios appeared to rise and fall respectively with clinical exacerbations and remissions of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data provide additional evidence for the involvement of cellular immune systems in these disease processes </plain></SENT>
