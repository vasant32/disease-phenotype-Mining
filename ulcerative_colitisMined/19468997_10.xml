<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the immunological link between these two clinical entities is still poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several lines of evidence indicate that SpA may originate from the relocation to the joints of the immune process primarily induced in the gut </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The transfer of the intestinal inflammatory process into the joints implicates that immune cells activated in the gut-draining lymph nodes can localize, at a certain point of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal disease</z:e>, either into the gut or into the joints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is indicated by the overlapping expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules observed on the surface of intestinal and synovial endothelial cells during <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> antigens and HLA-B27 expression may be implicated in the reactivation of T cells at the articular level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, accumulating evidence indicates that a T helper 17 cell-mediated immune response may contribute to IBD and IBD-related SpA with a crucial role played by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha in CD and to a lesser extent in UC </plain></SENT>
