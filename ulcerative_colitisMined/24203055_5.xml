<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over 150 genetic loci are associated with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The genetic contribution of the majority of those loci towards explained heritability is low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have reported an increasing spectrum of human monogenic diseases that can present with IBD-like <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A substantial proportion of patients with those genetic defects present with very early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 40 monogenic defects with IBD-like pathology selected in this review can be grouped into defects in intestinal epithelial barrier and stress response, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiencies</z:hpo> affecting granulocyte and phagocyte activity, hyper- and autoinflammatory disorders as well as defects with disturbed T and B lymphocyte selection and activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, there are defects in immune regulation affecting regulatory T cell activity and interleukin (IL)-10 signalling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Related to the variable penetrance of the IBD-like phenotype, there is a likely role for modifier genes and gene-environment interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment options in this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of disorders range from anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapy to blockade of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor α and IL-1β, surgery, haematopoietic stem cell transplantation or gene therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Understanding of prototypic monogenic 'orphan' diseases cannot only provide treatment options for the affected patients but also inform on immunological mechanisms and complement the functional understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD </plain></SENT>
