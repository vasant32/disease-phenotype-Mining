<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the pregnancy outcome of women with IBD who have been exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 215 pregnancies in 204 women were registered and documented in the CESAME cohort between May 2004 and October 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physicians documented the following information from the women: last menstrual date, delivery term, details of pregnancy outcome, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e>, birth weight and height, congenital abnormalities, medication history during each trimester, smoking history and alcohol ingestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were compared between three groups: women exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi> (group A), women receiving a drug other than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi> (group B) and women not receiving any medication (group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age at pregnancy was 28.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>75.7% of the women had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and 21.8% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, with a mean disease duration of 6.8 years at inclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 215 pregnancies, there were 138 births (142 newborns), and the mean birth weight was 3135 g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 86 pregnancies in group A, 84 in group B and 45 in group C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interrupted pregnancies occurred in 36% of patients enrolled in group A, 33% of patients enrolled in group B, and 40% of patients enrolled in group C; congenital abnormalities arose in 3.6% of group A cases and 7.1% of group B cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between the three groups in overall pregnancy outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained from this cohort indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> use during pregnancy is not associated with increased risks, including congenital abnormalities </plain></SENT>
