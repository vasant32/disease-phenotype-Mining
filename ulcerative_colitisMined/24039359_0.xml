<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To compare the mucosal concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>) resulting from different pharmaceutical formulations and analyse the influence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> on the mucosal concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 130 inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> as pH-dependent-release formulations (73 patients), time-dependent-release formulations (11 patients), or pro-drugs (18 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, 28 patients were receiving topical treatment (2-4 g/d) with pH-dependent-release formulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic biopsies were obtained from the sigmoid region during the colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> concentrations (ng/mg) were measured in tissue homogenates using high-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The t test and Mann-Whitney test, when appropriate, were used for statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients receiving pH-dependent-release formulations showed significantly higher mucosal concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> (51.75 ± 5.72 ng/mg) compared with patients receiving pro-drugs (33.35 ± 5.78 ng/mg, P = 0.01) or time-dependent-release formulations (38.24 ± 5.53 ng/mg, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with endoscopic remission had significantly higher mucosal concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> than patients with active disease (60.14 ± 7.95 ng/mg vs 35.66 ± 5.68 ng/mg, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained when we compared patients with the histological appearance of remission and patients with active histological <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (67.53 ± 9.22 ng/mg vs 35.53 ± 5.63 ng/mg, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher mucosal concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> were detected in patients treated with both oral and topical treatments in combination compared with patients who received oral treatment with pH-dependent-release formulations alone (72.33 ± 11.23 ng/mg vs 51.75 ± 5.72 ng/mg, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IBD patients showed significant variability in mucosal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> concentrations depending on the type of formulation, and the highest mean concentration was achieved using pH-dependent-release formulations </plain></SENT>
