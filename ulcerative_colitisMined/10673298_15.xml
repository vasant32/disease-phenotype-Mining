<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relative risk correlates with the extent and duration of the disease but the genetic basis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To assess the prevalence of microsatellite instability and mismatch repair gene abnormalities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Forty six patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, with a previous histological diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The frequency of microsatellite instability and/or immunohistochemical expression of hMSH2 and hMLH1 was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty three cases were investigated using both approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although 6/41 (14.6%) cases showed microsatellite instability at one or more markers, only one case (2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>4%) exhibited high level instability (at least two markers affected) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 38 cases which were assessed using antibodies against hMSH2 and hMLH1, only one case (2.6%) showed loss of expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This case, which showed loss of hMSH2 expression, was the same case which exhibited high level microsatellite instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 33 cases which were investigated using both approaches showed that loss of expression of either hMSH2 or hMLH1 was not seen in any case which exhibited microsatellite instability in no more than one marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that both high level microsatellite instability and loss of expression of hMSH2/hMLH1 are infrequent events in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Low level microsatellite instability was not associated with loss of expression of either hMSH2 or hMLH1 </plain></SENT>
