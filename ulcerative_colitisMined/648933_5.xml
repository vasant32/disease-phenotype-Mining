<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the pathogenetic significance of impaired cellular immunity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD), we have measured the cutaneous responsiveness to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34718">dinitrochlorobenzene</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34718">DNCB</z:chebi>) among 58 patients with IBD, 33 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and 25 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, 63 of their clinically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> relatives, 24 additional <z:mp ids='MP_0009482'>ileitis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> patients who had undergone resection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> visibly diseased bowel, and 23 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002965'>Cutaneous anergy</z:hpo> to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34718">DNCB</z:chebi> was demonstrated among 70% of the patients with CD and 48% of those with UC, as against only 9% of the controls (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no increased incidence of anergy among either 44 first-degree relatives (7%) or 19 spouses (3%), nor was there any special proclivity toward anergy among six pairs of patients with familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, anergy was still present after bowel resection in six of 10 patients (60%), while in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> anergy was found after colectomy in only two of 14 patients (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the immune defect in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> may be a secondary phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, the defect appears to reverse after colectomy, but in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> it persists despite resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding is consistent with the observed tendency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, to inexorable postoperative recurrence </plain></SENT>
