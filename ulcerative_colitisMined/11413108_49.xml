<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Activated T cells are more susceptible to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> than resting T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As intestinal T cells normally exhibit a higher state of activation, <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> may be necessary to maintain immune homeostasis in the specialised microenvironment of the mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) mucosal T cells are resistant to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, suggesting abnormal regulation of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To investigate differences in expression of anti- and proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, key regulators of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, between circulating and mucosal T cells, and possible alterations in CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Lamina propria T cells (LPT) were isolated from 10 control, seven CD, and eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) patients, and peripheral blood T cells (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53322">PBT</z:chebi>) from healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Purified T cells were stained intracellularly for Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), and Bax, and mean fluorescence intensity measured by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53322">PBT</z:chebi>, the expression level of Bcl-2 and Bax, but not Bcl-x(L), was significantly greater in LPT, resulting in lower Bcl-x(L)/Bax ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53322">PBT</z:chebi>, Bax expression was highly and significantly correlated with both Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L), but correlation with Bcl-2 was absent in LPT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bax expression in CD, but not UC, LPT was significantly lower than in control LPT, resulting in a significantly higher Bcl-x(L)/Bax ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The significant correlation of Bcl-x(L) to Bax was preserved in CD, but not UC, LPT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Regulation of Bcl-2 family protein expression differs between circulating and mucosal T cells, probably underlying diverse survival potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In CD LPT, a low Bax expression and a high Bcl-x(L)/Bax ratio favour resistance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and may contribute to the chronicity of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
