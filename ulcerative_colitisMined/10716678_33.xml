<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Colonocyte <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> metabolism was investigated in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>Colitis</z:hpo> was induced in Swiss outbred white mice by oral administration of 4% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34674">dextran sulphate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (DSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Colonocytes isolated from colitic and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control mice were incubated with [(14)C]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and production of (14)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi>, as well as of intermediate metabolites (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="13705">acetoacetate</z:chebi>, beta-hydroxybutyrate and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>), was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of different substrate concentrations on oxidation was also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">Butyrate</z:chebi> oxidation (micromol/h per mg protein; mean (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>)) was significantly reduced in DSS <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, values on day 7 of DSS administration being 0.177 (0.007) compared with 0.406 (0.035) for control animals (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> oxidation (micromol/h per mg protein; mean (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>)) on day 7 of DSS administration was significantly higher than in controls (0.06 (0.006) v 0.027 (0.004), p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Production of beta-hydroxybutyrate was decreased and production of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> increased in DSS <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increasing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> concentration from 10 to 80 mM enhanced oxidation in DSS <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (0.036 (0.002) to 0.285 (0.040), p&lt;0.001), although it continued to remain lower than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surface and crypt epithelial cells showed similar ratios of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When 1 mM DSS was added to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonocytes in vitro, it did not alter <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The initial histological lesion of DSS administration was very patchy and involved crypt cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Abnormal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> oxidation became apparent only after six days of DSS administration, at which time histological abnormalities were more widespread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Colonocyte metabolism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>, but not of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, is impaired in DSS <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, and may be important in pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Histological abnormalities preceded measurable defects in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> oxidation </plain></SENT>
