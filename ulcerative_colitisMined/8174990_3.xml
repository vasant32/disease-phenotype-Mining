<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, class II antigen (HLA-DR and DQ) expression on peripheral blood monocytes was investigated in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> in relation to disease activity and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The percentage positivity and fluorescent intensity of expression of HLA-DR and DQ antigens on monocytes were determined in whole blood samples using dual colour immunofluorescence labelling and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was assessed using clinical and laboratory indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in percentage positivity or fluorescent intensity of class II antigen expression between patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentage of monocytes displaying HLA-DR positivity was significantly decreased in patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (active %: 49.5 (5.6); inactive %: 78.9 (6.9); p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients requiring surgical resection of diseased bowel, the percentage of monocytes displaying HLA-DR positivity (51.9 (4.0) %) was significantly reduced compared with patients receiving medical treatment alone (81.1 (3.5) %; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reduced monocyte HLA-DR expression is therefore associated with disease activity and seems to predict outcome in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
