<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To identify the associations of genetic and epigenetic variations in IL-23R and IL-17A with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The promoter and exon regions of IL-23R and IL-17A were analysed in 727 subjects (201 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 268 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 258 healthy controls) using DNA sequencing and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transcription factor binding affinity, IL-17A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and methylation of the IL-17A promoter were evaluated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Jurkat cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A case-control analysis showed that development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> is associated with the IL-23R variant G149R (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.68) and IL-17A variant IVS1+18G&gt;C (OR 10.65, 95% CI 1.32 to 85.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients showed an association with IL-23R variants G149R (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.76), IVS4+17C&gt;T (OR 2.89, 95% CI 1.20 to 6.96) and Q3H (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.99), and IL-17A variants -737C&gt;T (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.13), -197G&gt;A (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.97) and IVS1+18 G&gt;C (OR 8.93, 95% CI 1.12 to 70.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The -877G, -737T and -444A risk alleles of IL-17A displayed higher binding affinities with the transcription factor complex and higher expression levels of IL-17A transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA hypomethylation of the IL-17A promoter was observed in PBMC from IBD patients with a significant inverse correlation between methylation extent of IVS1+17 and IL-17A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, Jurkat cells recovered IL-17A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression after exposure to demethylating agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results provide insights into the genetic and epigenetic interactions in the IL-23R/IL-17 axis that are associated with elevated expression of IL-17 and IBD pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
