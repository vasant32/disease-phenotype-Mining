<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The natural history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> requires continuous monitoring of medical treatment via frequent outpatient visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The European health authorities' focus on e-health is increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lack of easy access to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) clinics, patients' education and understanding of the importance of early treatment at relapse is leading to poor compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To overcome these limitations a randomised control trial 'Constant-care' was undertaken in Denmark and Ireland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 333 patients with mild/moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="20551">5-aminosalicylate</z:chebi> acid treatment were randomised to either a web-group receiving disease specific education and self-treatment via http://www.constant-care.dk or a control group continuing the usual care for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A historical control group was included to test the comparability with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We investigated: feasibility of the approach, its influence on patients' compliance, knowledge, quality of life (QoL), disease outcomes, safety and health care costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 88% of the web patients preferred using the new approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adherence to 4 weeks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> treatment was increased by 31% in Denmark and 44% in Ireland compared to the control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In Denmark IBD knowledge and QoL were significantly improved in web patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median relapse duration was 18 days (95% CI 10 to 21) in the web versus 77 days (95% CI 46 to 108) in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and routine visits to the outpatient clinic was lower in the web than in the control group, resulting in a saving of 189 euro/patient/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No difference in the relapse frequency, hospitalisation, surgery or adverse events was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The historical control group was comparable with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The new web-guided approach on http://www.constant-care.dk is feasible, safe and cost effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It empowers patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> without increasing their morbidity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It has yet to be shown whether this strategy can change the natural disease course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in the long term </plain></SENT>
