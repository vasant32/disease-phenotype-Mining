<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine the anti-inflammatory activity of probiotic Bifidobacteria in Bifidobacteria-fermented milk (BFM) which is effective against active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and exacerbations of UC, and to explore the immunoregulatory mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) from UC patients or HT-29 cells were co-cultured with heat-killed probiotic bacteria or culture supernatant of Bifidobacterium breve strain Yakult (BbrY) or Bifidobacterium bifidum strain Yakult (BbiY) to estimate the amount of IL-10 or IL-8 secreted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both strains of probiotic Bifidobacteria contained in the BFM induced IL-10 production in PBMNC from UC patients, though BbrY was more effective than BbiY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conditioned medium (CM) and DNA of both strains inhibited IL-8 secretion in HT-29 cells stimulated with TNF-alpha, whereas no such effect was observed with heat-killed bacteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effect of CM derived from BbiY was greater than that of CM derived from BbrY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNAs of the two strains had a comparable inhibitory activity against the secretion of IL-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CM of BbiY induced a repression of IL-8 gene expression with a higher expression of IkappaB-zeta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> 4 h after culture of HT-29 cells compared to that in the absence of CM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Probiotic Bifidobacterium strains in BFM enhance IL-10 production in PBMNC and inhibit IL-8 secretion in intestinal epithelial cells, suggesting that BFM has anti-inflammatory effects against <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
