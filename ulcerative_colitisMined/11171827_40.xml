<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hypermethylation of the E-cadherin gene (CDH1) has not been described previously in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: A panel of SCRC and UCACRC were investigated for mutations in CDH1, and for hypermethylation of the promoter region of CDH1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: DNA was available from 14 patients with UCACRC and from 14 with SCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> exons of CDH1 were amplified with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and screened using single strand conformational polymorphism and direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hypermethylation of the CDH1 promoter region was determined by methylation specific PCR following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulphite</z:chebi> modification, and compared with E-cadherin protein expression from a previous immunohistochemistry study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen of 28 cancers (46%) were hypermethylated in the CDH1 promoter region-eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (57%) in the UCACRC group and five <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (36%) in the SCRC group (NS)-and this correlated with reduced E-cadherin expression (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a trend for methylation to be associated with a more advanced stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> although this did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no mutations in CDH1 in either group although there were several polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated hypermethylation of the promoter region in CDH1 in 46% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between the UCACRC and SCRC groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Just as there are specific differences in the genetic changes between UCACRC and SCRC, there is also likely to be a large degree of overlap among the genetic pathways of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
