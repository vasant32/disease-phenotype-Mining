<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To focus on the role of CD40 and CD40L in their pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed by immunohistochemistry the CD40 and CD40L expression in the pouch mucosa of 28 patients who had undergone RPC for UC, in the terminal ileum of 6 patients with UC and 11 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also examined by flow cytometry the expression of CD40 by B lymphocytes and monocytes in the peripheral blood of 20 pouch patients, 15 UC patients and 11 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ileal pouch mucosa leukocytes presented a significantly higher expression of CD40 and CD40L as compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This alteration correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e>, but was also present in the healthy pouch and in the terminal ileum of UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD40 expression of peripheral B lymphocytes was significantly higher in patients with UC and pouch, respect to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased CD40 levels in blood B cells of pouch patients correlated with the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0949691" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SPDA1">spondyloarthropathy</z:e>, but not with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e>, or inflammatory indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High CD40 expression in the ileal pouch mucosa could be implied in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> following proctocolectomy for UC, whereas its increased levels on peripheral blood B lymphocytes are associated with the presence of extraintestinal manifestations </plain></SENT>
