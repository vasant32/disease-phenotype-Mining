<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the contribution of variants of CARD15, OCTN1/2 and DLG5 genes in disease predisposition and phenotypes in a large Italian cohort of pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), 186 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) patients, 434 parents (217 trios), and 347 healthy controls (HC) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms of the three major variants of CARD15, 1672C/T and -207G/C SNPs for OCTN genes, IGR2096a_1 and IGR2198a_1 SNPs for the IBD5 locus, and 113G/A variant of the DLG5 gene were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Potential correlations with clinical sub-phenotypes were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Polymorphisms of CARD15 were significantly associated with CD, and at least one variant was found in 38% of patients (15% in HC, OR = 2.7, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Homozygosis for both OCTN1/2 variants was more common in CD patients (1672TT 24%, -207CC 29%) than in HC (16% and 21%, respectively; P = 0.03), with an increased frequency of the TC haplotype (44.8% vs 38.3% in HC, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No association with the DLG5 variant was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD carriers of OCTN1/2 and DLG5 variants more frequently had penetrating disease (P = 0.04 and P = 0.01), while carriers of CARD15 more frequently had ileal localization (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No gene-gene interaction was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In UC patients, the TC haplotype was more frequent (45.4%, P = 0.03), but no genotype/phenotype correlation was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Polymorphisms of CARD15 and OCTN genes, but not DLG5 are associated with pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms of CARD15, OCTN, and DLG5 genes exert a weak influence on CD phenotype </plain></SENT>
