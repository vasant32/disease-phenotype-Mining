<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> occurs worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is considered common in most of Europe and North America and uncommon in most of the developing Asian countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence/prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> varies not only according to geographical region but also with race and ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There are no reported data from India on the incidence of the disease and its prevalence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Material and methods: A house to house survey was conducted by questionnaire, formulated to enquire about symptoms that are suggestive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those with prolonged diarrhoea with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> were considered as suspected cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These suspected cases were subjected to video sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy and rectal biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients already diagnosed and receiving treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, encountered during the survey, were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Resurvey of the same areas was conducted after a one year interval to detect new cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using direct methods, standardised rates were calculated using world standard population weights 22, 18, 16, 12, 12, 9, 7, 3, and 1 for each 10 year age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Standardised rates were also obtained separately for males, females, and combined populations, using the Punjab state 1991 population census data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Rates were also estimated according to UK 2000 population data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ninety five per cent confidence intervals (95% CI) of prevalence and incidence rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> were estimated under the assumption that the distribution of cases followed a Poisson probability model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total population of 51 910 were screened from January to March 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We identified 147 suspected cases and of these 23 were finally established as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> cases, giving a crude prevalence rate of 44.3 per 100 000 inhabitants (95% CI 29.4-66.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A second visit to the same areas after one year identified 10 suspected cases in a population of 49 834 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Of these, three were confirmed as "definite" <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> giving a crude incidence rate of 6.02 cases per 100 000 inhabitants (95% CI 1.2-17.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first population based study from India reporting on the incidence and prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The disease frequency is not much less than that reported from Europe and North America </plain></SENT>
