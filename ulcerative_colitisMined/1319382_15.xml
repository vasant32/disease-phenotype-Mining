<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, the effects of stimulation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi>, inhibition by a drug which specifically prevents activation of 5-lipoxygenase, and modification of the fatty acid composition of membrane <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">leukotriene B4</z:chebi> synthesis were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incubation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> (A23187) resulted in a dose and time dependent increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">leukotriene B4</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After cell <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> had been enriched with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17351">linoleic acid</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">leukotriene B4</z:chebi> synthesis was found to be increased 3.2-fold, 5.5-fold, and 6.1-fold above control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with MK-886 inhibited <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">leukotriene B4</z:chebi> synthesis by 79% to 94% in the various groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Variations in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acid</z:chebi> content of intestinal epithelial cells could be important in the modulation of cellular responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have shown for the first time in this human intestinal epithelial cell its ability to synthesise <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">leukotriene B4</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">leukotriene B4</z:chebi> synthesis can be modulated by the fatty acid composition of membrane <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, which can be altered by dietary fatty acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The synthesis of chemotatic factors, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">leukotriene B4</z:chebi>, by the mucosal epithelium may contribute to the recruitment of granulocytes into the colonic mucosa and across the epithelium, giving rise to the <z:mp ids='MP_0000491'>crypt abscesses</z:mp> which characterise <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
