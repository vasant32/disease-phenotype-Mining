<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our experience with this technique in 15 patients (nine with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, six with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>) is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Perfect agreement was not obtained between scintigraphic appearances and other conventional means in the assessment of extent of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Good correlation, however, was found between disease activity and recovery of labelled leucocytes in the faeces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While this latter finding could be used as an objective means of assessing response to therapy, it is concluded that conventional <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">indium</z:chebi> scintigraphy, using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">indium</z:chebi> oxine-labelling of mixed leucocytes, is insufficiently reliable to replace usual methods for determining extent of disease in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
