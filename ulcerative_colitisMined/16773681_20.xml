<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this field of science is to adapt drugs to a patient's specific genetic background and therefore make them more efficacious and safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this article we describe the variants in genes that influence either the efficacy or toxicity of common drugs used in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> (IBD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) including <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">sulfasalazine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> (AZA) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50667">6-mercaptopurine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6-MP</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX), glucocorticosteroids (CSs) and infliximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, difficulties with pharmacogenetic studies in general and more specifically in IBD are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although pharmacogenetics is a promising field that already contributed to a better understanding of some of the underlying mechanisms of action of drugs used in IBD, the only discovery translated until now into daily practice is the relation between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> S-methyltransferase (TPMT) gene polymorphisms and hematological toxicity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the future it is necessary to organize studies in well characterized patient cohorts who have been uniformly treated and systematically evaluated in order to quantitate drug response more objectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An effort should be made to collect genomic DNA from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients enrolled in clinical drug trials after appropriate informed consent for pharmacogenetic studies </plain></SENT>
