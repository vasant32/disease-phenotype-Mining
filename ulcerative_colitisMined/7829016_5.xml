<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The colectomy group mainly comprised patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001436" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adenomatosis</z:e> coli, in whom only a short length of the terminal ileum (mean (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) 2.25 (0.57) cm) had been resected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The reconstruction procedures were ileoanal anastomosis in two patients, terminal ileostomy in two, ileorectal anastomosis in one, and J shaped ileal pouch-anal anastomosis in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distributions of age, sex, and relative body weight were similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The gall bladder bile was lithogenic in the post colectomy group--these patients had a significantly increased cholesterol saturation index (p &lt; 0.01) and rapid cholesterol nucleation time (p &lt; 0.05) compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in the molar percentage of cholesterol and a decrease in that of total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> associated with significantly decreased secondary <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.05) were observed in the post colectomy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>Gall stones</z:mp> formed in two of six patients after colectomy were cholesterol stones containing more than 80% cholesterol by dry weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total and unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, pH, and ionised calcium values were similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that after total or subtotal colectomy the composition of gall bladder bile increases the risk of cholesterol <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gall stone</z:mp> formation </plain></SENT>
