<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum was collected from: 29 patients with primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp>, 18 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> alone, 19 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005398" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">extrahepatic biliary obstruction</z:e> of other causes, and 42 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bile duct antibodies reacted with an antigen localised to the small and large intrahepatic bile ducts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When blood group A human liver was used they were detected in 34% of patients with primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were not detected when blood group O human liver was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bile duct antibodies that reacted with obstructed and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rabbit liver were detected in 34% and 17% respectively of patients with primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> but were also present in similar proportions of control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Colon antibodies that reacted with human and rabbit colon were found in 52% and 24% respectively of patients with primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Absorption studies using blood group substances A and B abolished the reactivity of bile duct antibodies with human and rabbit liver and that of colon antibodies' with rabbit colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Colon antibodies that reacted with human colon were not absorbed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Absorption studies using isolated peripheral white blood cells did not affect reactivity of bile duct or colon antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that bile duct antibodies are disease, species, and tissue non-specific and react with blood group A/B antigens present in human and rabbit bile ducts and rabbit colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This suggests that they do not play a role in the pathogenesis of primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
