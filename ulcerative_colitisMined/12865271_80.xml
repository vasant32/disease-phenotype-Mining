<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Recent molecular data suggest that genetic factors may underlie the disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> observed in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A locus on chromosome 5q has been implicated in susceptibility to CD, and recently refined by linkage disequilibrium mapping to a conserved 250 kb haplotype (5q31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No data regarding the contribution of this locus to clinical phenotype exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this case control study, we investigated the contribution of this haplotype to both susceptibility and phenotype of CD and UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 330 Caucasian CD and 457 UC patients recruited from a single UK centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Association with disease susceptibility and phenotype was analysed with haplotypes reconstructed from three single nucleotide polymorphisms chosen to span this susceptibility region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evidence for possible genetic epistasis between IBD5 and NOD2/CARD15 was sought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Linkage disequilibrium across this region was confirmed, with two haplotypes comprising 88% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Susceptibility to CD, but not to UC, was associated with homozygosity for a common haplotype, H2 (p(c)=0.002; relative risk (RR) 2.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Genotype-phenotype analyses demonstrated that this association was particularly strong in patients with perianal disease (p(c)=0.0005; RR 1.7), especially in individuals homozygous for this haplotype (p(c)=0.0005; RR 3.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Importantly, no association with H2 was found in 186 patients without perianal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No evidence of epistasis between IBD5 and NOD2/CARD15 was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The IBD5 risk haplotype is associated with CD only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Genotype-phenotype analysis reveals that the strongest association is observed in patients with perianal CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>While the precise gene involved is unclear, these data provide further molecular evidence for a genetic basis of the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of CD </plain></SENT>
