<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the effect of Scutellariae Radix extract (SRE) on <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) in rats induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34674">dextran-sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (DSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>Colitis</z:hpo> was induced in male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (170-180 g) by 4% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34674">dextran sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (DSS, wt/v; MW 54000) in drinking water for 8 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The treated rats received 4% DSS and SRE orally (100 mg/kg per day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Control rats received either tap water or SRE only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Macroscopic assessment which included body weight changes, fecal occult blood and stool consistency were determined daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the appointed time, the rats were sacrificed and the entire colons were removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The colon length and the myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> was graded by morphological and histological assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ion transport activity of the colonic mucosa was assessed by electrophysiological technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rats treated with oral administration of 4% DSS regularly developed clinical and macroscopic signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment with SRE relieved the symptoms, including the reduction in body weight, shortening and ulceration of the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Administration of SRE also significantly reduced the histological damage induced by DSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the I(SC) responses of the colonic mucosa to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> were suppressed after the induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The stimulated ion transport activity of DSS-rats treated with SRE displayed significant improvement in the secretory responsiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SRE was effective in treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> DSS-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, as gauged by reduced clinical disease, improved macroscopic and histological damage scores, and enhanced recovery of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic secretory function </plain></SENT>
