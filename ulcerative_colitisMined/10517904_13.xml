<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To investigate the role of K-ras mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, in long standing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 161 microdissected and 100 DNA samples from 13 patients were analysed for K-ras codons 12 and 13 mutations by means of a combination of enriched polymerase chain reaction amplification and temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: K-ras mutations were found in 21/161 (13%) microdissected samples in 7/13 large bowels (16 and five in codons 12 and 13, respectively), and in 10/100 (10%) mucosal DNA samples (six and four, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of four patients with six <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> had a K-ras mutation in a <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, as well as one of two patients with large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> associated lesion or mass (DALM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight of 13 (61%) areas with villous architecture and large, distended goblet cells, had a K-ras mutation, which was significantly more frequent than in low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (one of 23, 4%) but did not reach significance versus high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (four of 14, 28.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>K-ras mutations were found in one of 20 (5%) flat lesions indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, two of 14 (14%) in non-villous, hypermucinous mucosa, and in one of 57 flat areas negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The highest K-ras mutation frequency was found in villous, hypermucinous mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that this entity should be investigated further as a potential risk lesion for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It may represent a pathway directly from non-classical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, not previously described </plain></SENT>
