<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Many lines of evidence suggest that T helper cell type 1 (Th1) immune responses predominate in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, a novel transcription factor T-box expressed in T cells (T-bet) has been reported as the master regulator of Th1 development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to investigate the role of T-bet and proinflammatory cytokines in Th1 mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_188'>immunopathology</z:mpath> in CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS: CD4+ lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs) were isolated from surgically resected specimens (CD, n = 10; <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), n = 10; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (NL), n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: (1) T-bet expression of CD4+ LPMCs was examined by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(2) T-bet expression of LPMCs stimulated by interleukin (IL)-12/IL-18 was analysed by western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(3) Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) production and T-bet expression of CD4+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were examined with or without stimulation by anti-CD3/CD28 monoclonal antibodies and/or IL-12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) T-bet expression of CD4+ LPMCs was increased in CD compared with UC and NL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(2) Synergistically, augmentation of IFN-gamma production by IL-12/IL-18 was independent of T-bet expression in LPMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(3) T-bet was induced by T cell receptor stimulation in CD4+ PBMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>T-bet induction correlated with IFN-gamma production and with augmentation of surface expressed IL-12 receptor beta2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: T-bet induction by antigenic stimulation and subsequent stimulation by macrophage derived IL-12/IL-18 are important for establishing Th1 mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_188'>immunopathology</z:mpath> in CD </plain></SENT>
