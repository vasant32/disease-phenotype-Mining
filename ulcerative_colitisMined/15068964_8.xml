<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) is a condition characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> targeted at the epithelial layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to being involved in immune phenomena, UC epithelial cells exhibit decreased oxidation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>, downregulation of oxidative pathway regulatory genes, and overexpression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> (mt) genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether these events, which translate an altered energy metabolism, are associated with an abnormal pattern of mtDNA deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Highly purified colonocytes were isolated from surgically resected control, involved and uninvolved <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency, type, and number of mtDNA deletions were assessed by PCR amplification, Southern blot analysis, and cloning and sequencing of amplified DNA fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 4977 mtDNA deletion was less frequent in UC than control and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) epithelium, regardless of patient age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several other deletions were detected, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were less common in UC than control and CD cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency, variety, and number of mtDNA deletions were invariably lower in colonocytes isolated from inflamed mucosa than in autologous cells from noninflamed mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in the absence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, UC colonocytes exhibit an mtDNA deletion pattern similar to that of control cells, indicating a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> response to physiological levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In active <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, when <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> increases, the frequency, variety, and number of mtDNA deletions decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because comparable abnormalities are absent in active CD, the mtDNA deletion pattern of active UC suggests that colonocytes respond uniquely to <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-associated stress in this condition </plain></SENT>
