<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Overall, 83 new cases of IBD (41 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, 42 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>) and 160 healthy controls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Portions per week of 34 foods and beverages before <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms were recorded using a validated questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Duration of symptoms before IBD diagnosis, presence of specific symptoms and their impact on subjective changes in usual dietary habits were also recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association between diet and IBD was investigated by multiple logistic regression and dietary patterns were assessed by factor analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Changes in dietary habits, due to the presence of symptoms, were reported by 38.6% of patients and were not significantly related to specific symptoms, rather to long duration of symptoms, only in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In IBD patients who did not change dietary habits, moderate and high consumption of margarine (OR = 11.8 and OR = 21.37) was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, whilst high consumption of red meat (OR = 7.8) and high intake of cheese were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: More than one third of IBD patients change dietary habits before diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Margarine, red meat and cheese increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
