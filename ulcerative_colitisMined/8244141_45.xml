<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is effective in the treatment and prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> but has not been studied in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A two year prospective study of HRT in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> was performed in 47 postmenopausal women aged 44 to 67 years with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (25) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients had radial and spinal bone density measured annually by single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> absorptiometry and quantitative computed tomography respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean (95% confidence intervals) annual change in radial bone density was +1.42%/yr (+0.58 to +2.26; P &lt; 0.005) and for spinal bone +2.60%/yr (+1.06 to +4.15; p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between rates of change of bone density at the two sites, or between the rates of change and the initial bone density either in the radius or spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients were given <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> during the study, and their rates of change for spinal bone density were lower, but values were not statistically significantly different from those who did not receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Changes in bone density for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The change in bone density did not correlate with the patients' age or number of years after the menopause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that HRT is effective in prevention of bone loss in postmenopausal women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
