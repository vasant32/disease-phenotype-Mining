<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study investigated a possible role of Escherichia coli in propagation and perpetuation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lesions of UC are located superficially on the rectal and/or colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the commensal bacteria of the digestive tract may play a role in the pathogenesis of UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several studies have demonstrated proliferation of E. coli in the gut of UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An increase in the number of E. coli in the inflamed tissue is most probably related to the abundance of iron ions produced by the bacteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Colon mucosal biopsies were collected from 30 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase UC, both from tissues with inflammatory changes (n = 30) and unchanged tissue with no inflammatory changes (n = 30) from the same patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were also taken from 16 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022104" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IBS">irritable bowel syndrome</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> who comprised the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the biopsy specimens was performed using culture methods and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Genotyping of the E. coli isolates was done using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multiplex PCR was used to compare the E. coli strains for the presence of genes responsible for synthesis of iron acquisition proteins: iroN, iutA, iha, ireA, chuA, and hlyA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We demonstrated that there was a significant increase in the number of E. coli at the sites of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in patients with UC compared to the control group (P = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Comparative analysis of the restriction patterns of E. coli isolated from inflammatory and unchanged tissues showed that the local inflammatory changes did not promote specific E. coli strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in the frequency of the iroN gene in E. coli isolated from patients with UC as compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The increase in the numbers of E. coli in the inflammatory tissues is related to the presence of chuA and iutA genes, which facilitate iron acquisition during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> intestinal inflammatory processes </plain></SENT>
