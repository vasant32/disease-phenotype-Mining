<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudopolyps</z:e> was monitored in 25 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> classified according to Powell-Tuck index as mild (n=12) or moderate (n=13) form of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with a mild form of disease were treated with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> medication (2-4 g/day) and local <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> preparation (suppository) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with a moderate form of disease received oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> medication (2-4 g/day), local <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> preparation (suppository) and local <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> at an initial dose of 60 mg/day, followed by dose tapering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>How many significant variables (previously determined by analysis of variance) were elevated in the groups with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudopolyp</z:e> developement was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ROC analysis for calculation of new index was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum values of procollagen III <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (PIIIP), C-reactive protein (CRP) and C4 complement component (C4) were statistically significantly lower in the group of patients free from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudopolyp</z:e> development than those who developed one or more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudopolyps</z:e> (0.45+/-0.12 vs 1.42+/-0.70, P&lt;0.0027; 7.6+/-4.7 vs 17.8+/-9.17, P&lt;0.035; and 0.46+/-0.11 vs 0.34+/-0.16, P&lt;0.068, respectively) at endoscopic conrtrols with patohistologically samples during 13 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences in the values of C3, ceruloplasmin and IgM between the two groups (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Discrimination function analysis yielded highest standardized cannon coefficients for PIIIP (0.876), CRP (0.104), C3 (-0.534) and C4 (0.184) (P&lt;0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The elevation in two of three laboratory variables (PIIIP, CRP and C4) reached sensitivity of 93 % and specificity of 90 % in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudopolyps</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is proposed that an increase in two of the three laboratory parameters (PIIIP, CRP and C4) could improve the accuracy of prediction of the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudopolyps</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When using PIIIP, CRP and C4 on decision making, the positive predictive value and accuracy were 90 % and 92 %, respectively </plain></SENT>
