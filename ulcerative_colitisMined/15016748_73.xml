<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report clinical features and treatment outcome in a large patient cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were searched for in 24 Swedish gastroenterology clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The biopsy material was reassessed using strict histopathological criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical data were obtained from medical notes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 199 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The female:male ratio was 2.4:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median age at diagnosis was 59 (48-70) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most frequent symptoms were diarrhoea (96%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> (47%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (41%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The course was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> intermittent in 30% of patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> continuous in 7%, and a single attack in 63%, and in these cases the disease duration was 6 (4-11) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seventy nine (40%) patients reported associated diseases, of which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040128,C0162044" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyroid disorders</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coeliac disease</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were the most common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 34 first or second degree relatives of 24 (12%) patients, a family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, collagenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coeliac disease</z:e> was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Drug induced disease was suspected in 19 (10%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A non-significant peak of disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was seen in December-January </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>More than 80% of treated patients improved on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3207">budesonide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A family history of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel disorders</z:e> is a new finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and single attack of limited duration may support a possible infectious cause in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Drugs may cause lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
