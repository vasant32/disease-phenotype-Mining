<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In disease of the small intestine and appendix there is usually a fall in the number of Paneth cells normally present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Occasionally, as in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, there may be proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In disease of the colon the number of Paneth cells is unaltered in functional and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008073" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">developmental disorders</z:e> and increased in the inflammatory and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the Paneth cell proliferation originates from stem cells in the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The significance of an increase in Paneth cells is discussed and it is suggested that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> it may produce a self-perpetuating and destructive state </plain></SENT>
