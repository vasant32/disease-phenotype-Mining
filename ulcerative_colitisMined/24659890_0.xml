<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The data from 41 patients with CD and 22 patients with UC were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four CD patients received infliximab, and 17 received adalimumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The endoscopic severity of CD was quantified with the simplified endoscopic activity score for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> in CD and with the Mayo endoscopic subscore in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mucosal healing was achieved in 23 CD and 7 UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biological therapy had to be restarted in 78% of patients achieving complete mucosal healing with CD and in 100% of patients with UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither clinical remission nor mucosal healing was associated with the time to restarting the biological therapy in either CD or UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Mucosal healing did not predict sustained clinical remission in patients in whom the biological therapies had been stopped </plain></SENT>
