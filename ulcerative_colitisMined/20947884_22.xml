<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A placebo-controlled trial was warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the efficacy of visilizumab induction treatment in 127 patients with severely active UC despite treatment with ≥5 days of intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received placebo or visilizumab 5μg/kg intravenously on days 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">Corticosteroids</z:chebi> were tapered according to disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up for 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was induction of response at day 45 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points included remission and mucosal healing at day 45, symptomatic response at day 15 and colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Response at day 45 occurred in 55% of patients receiving visilizumab compared with 47% of those who received placebo (p=0.475) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Remission at day 45 occurred in 8% of patients receiving visilizumab compared with 9% of those who received placebo (p=0.704) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mucosal healing at day 45 occurred in 29% of patients receiving visilizumab compared with 26% of those who received placebo (p=0.799) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic response at day 15 occurred in 82% of patients receiving visilizumab compared with 74% of those who received placebo (p=0.244) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Colectomy was performed in 18% of patients receiving visilizumab compared with 7% of those who received placebo (p=0.130) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cardiac disorders</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disorders</z:e> occurred more frequently in the patients who received visilizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Visilizumab at a dose of 5μg/kg for two consecutive days was not effective for severe, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi>-refractory UC and was associated with increased cardiac and vascular adverse events </plain></SENT>
