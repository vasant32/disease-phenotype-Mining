<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To clarify the impact of cytomegalovirus (CMV) activation and antiviral therapy based on CMV antigen status on the long-term clinical course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: UC patients with flare-up were divided into CMV-positive and -negative groups according to the CMV antigenemia assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main treatment strategy provided for the patients in the CMV-positive group comprised a dose reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median number of days to initial remission was significantly greater for the patients in the CMV-positive group (21 d vs 16 d, P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the relapse rate after remission and colectomy rate during more than 30 mo of observation did not differ between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi> was the only independent factor for avoiding colectomy in patients of the CMV-positive group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CMV antigen status did not significantly affect the long-term prognosis in UC patients under treatment with appropriate antiviral therapy </plain></SENT>
