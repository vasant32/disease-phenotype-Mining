<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to assess HRQoL of IBD patients in South-Western Greece </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 89 IBD patients [38 (42.7%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), 51 (57.3%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC)] were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HRQoL was assessed using IBD questionnaire (IBDQ), which tests four health domains: bowel symptoms (BS), systemic symptoms (SS), emotional function (EF) and social function (SF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total score (TS) ranges from 32 to 224 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was measured using <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's Disease</z:hpo> Activity Index (CDAI) (CD), and Truelove and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271977" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Witts</z:e> classification (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The impact of epidemiological and disease-specific characteristics on IBDQ was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> IBDQ scores between UC and CD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found regarding age, sex, smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, disease duration and use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="20551">5-aminosalicylates</z:chebi> or immunosuppressives with HRQoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The factors found to have a major negative impact on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> IBDQ scores was disease severity both in CD and UC, and education on bowel symptoms in CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, only high disease activity had significant effects on total and dimensional scores of IBDQ in UC (TS, P=0.005; BS, P&lt;0.001; SS, P=0.004; EF, P=0.05; SF, P=0.001), whereas in CD, only CDAI (TS, P=0.001; BS, P=0.004; SS, P=0.001; EF, P=0.003; SF, P=0.003) and education (TS, P=0.047; BS, P=0.004; SS, P=0.03) had significant effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IBD patients in remission experience better HRQoL than patients with active disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Induction of remission should become the mainstay of care regarding improvement in HRQoL </plain></SENT>
