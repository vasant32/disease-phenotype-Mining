<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These were divided arbitrarily into either undernourished or well nourished groups according to whether their midarm circumference was below or above 90% of ideal standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results were also compared with 33 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and 28 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Undernourished patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> had significantly reduced total lymphocyte and T lymphocyte counts and a reduced proportion of monocytes that ingested latex particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Well nourished patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> were similar to the two control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty one undernourished patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> were also followed during the course of two to four months' nutritional treatment with an enteral supplement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nutritional therapy was associated with significant anthropometric gains as well as significant rises in total lymphocyte and T lymphocyte counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum orosomucoids were significantly higher in undernourished patients and decreased significantly during nutritional therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results show that undernutrition and disease acuity may be associated with reduced immunological competence in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these measurements can be improved by short term nutritional treatment </plain></SENT>
