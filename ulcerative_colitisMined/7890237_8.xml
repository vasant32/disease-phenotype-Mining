<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> selectively inhibited fatty acid oxidation in the liver or caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> damage in intestinal cells, its effect on substrate oxidation by isolated colonocytes of man and rat was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">Ibuprofen</z:chebi> dose dependently (2.0-7.5 mmol/l) and selectively inhibited 14CO2 production from labelled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">n-butyrate</z:chebi> in colonocytes from the proximal and distal human colon (n = 12, p = &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because the concentrations of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> that can be attained in the human colon are not known, conclusions drawn from current dosages are tentative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of fatty acid oxidation by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> may be biochemically implicated in the initiation and exacerbation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, manifestation of which would depend on the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> concentrations reached in the colon </plain></SENT>
