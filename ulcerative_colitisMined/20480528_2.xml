<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate serum levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15356">Hcys</z:chebi>) and the risk that altered levels carry for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> development in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 55 UC patients and 45 healthy adults were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15356">Hcys</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> levels were measured in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical history and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15356">Hcys</z:chebi> level in the UC patients was 13.3 +/- 1.93 micromol/L (range 4.60-87) and was higher than the average <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15356">Hcys</z:chebi> level of the control group which was 11.2 +/- 3.58 micromol/L (range 4.00-20.8) (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">Vitamin B12</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> average values were also lower in the UC group (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When multivariate regression analysis was performed, it was seen that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> deficiency was the only risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Frequencies of thromboembolic complications were not statistically significantly different in UC and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When those with and without a <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> history in the UC group were compared according to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15356">Hcys</z:chebi> levels, it was seen that there were no statistically significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A negative linear relationship was found between <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> levels and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15356">Hcys</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We could not find any correlations between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15356">Hcys</z:chebi> levels and history of prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
