<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Infrequently, a refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> (RP) presents with certain clinical, endoscopic, and pathological features resembling <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and is often ascribed to misdiagnosis of the initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test that hypothesis and to identify risk factors for RP, this study reviewed cases of presumed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> with ileal pouches constructed at The Mount Sinai Hospital between 1973 and 1986 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty four cases with RP (16 Kock pouches and eight pelvic pouches) and 21 controls were compared for eight clinical variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The original colectomy slides from 15 RP and 18 control cases were reviewed blindly, classified into five histological categories (corresponding to definite <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, definite <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, and three indeterminate groups), and scored for 23 histological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant clinical differences between RP and control cases except for more frequent extraintestinal manifestations (38% v 5%) and male preponderance (79% v 43%) in RP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were also no significant differences between the distributions of RP cases and controls among the five histological categories or in the 23 histological features studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> therefore does not seem to reflect underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, but may be linked to immunological mechanisms that are manifested clinically as extraintestinal complications </plain></SENT>
