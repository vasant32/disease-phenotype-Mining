<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To detect precancerous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> often undergo colonoscopic surveillance based on American or British guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is recommended that surveillance is initiated after 8-10 years of extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, or after 15-20 years for left-sided disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These starting points, however, are not based on solid scientific evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to assess the time interval between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) and colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), and subsequently evaluate how many patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> before their surveillance was recommended to commence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A nationwide automated pathology database (PALGA) was consulted to identify patients with IBD-associated colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in seven university medical centres in The Netherlands between January 1990 and June 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were collected retrospectively from patient charts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Time intervals between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of disease and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis were calculated in months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 149 patients were identified with confirmed diagnoses of IBD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> n = 89/<z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> n = 59/indeterminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taking date of diagnosis as the entry point, 22% of patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> before the 8 or 15 year starting points of surveillance, and 28% if surveillance was commenced 10 or 20 years after diagnosis for extensive or left-sided disease, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms to calculate the time interval, 17-22% of patients would present with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> prior to the surveillance starting points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is delayed or missed in a substantial number of patients (17-28%) when conducting surveillance strictly according to formal guidelines </plain></SENT>
