<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We probed the nationwide registered database to assess the incidence, prevalence, gender distribution, age of diagnosis and the survival status of IBD patients in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to analyze the registered database compiled by the National Health Insurance provided by the Department of Health, Taiwan, from January 1998 through December 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1591 IBD patients were registered from 1998 to 2008 in Taiwan (CD: 385; UC: 1206) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of CD increased from 0.19/100,000 in 1998 to 0.24/100,000 in 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of UC increased from 0.61/100,000 in 1998 to 0.94/100,000 in 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of CD increased from 0.19/100,000 in 1998 to 1.78/100,000 in 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of UC increased from 0.61/100,000 in 1998 to 7.62/100,000 in 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Male to female ratio for CD was 2.22 and 1.64 for UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age of registered for CD was predominantly between 20 to 39, and for UC between 30 to 49Â years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The standardized mortality ratio (95% CI) was 4.97 (3.72-6.63) for CD and 1.78 (1.46-2.17) for UC, from 1998 to 2008 in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Using the Taiwan nationwide database for IBD, the incidence and prevalence of IBD in Taiwan significantly increased from 1998 to 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate was higher for CD patients than UC patients, and both were higher than the general population </plain></SENT>
