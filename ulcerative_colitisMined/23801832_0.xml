<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fecal samples were collected from 14 control individuals (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhoid</z:e> patients only) and 26 UC patients (severe: n = 12, moderate: n = 6, remission: n = 8), recruited by the gastroenterologist at the Department of Gastroenterology, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Disease activity in UC patients was determined by clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> activity index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We employed fluorescent in situ hybridization in combination with flow cytometry to enumerate the clostridium cluster population targeted by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26833">16S</z:chebi> rRNA gene probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Major <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>-producing species within this cluster were quantified to see if any change existed in control vs UC patients with different disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This observed change was further validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to this, we carried out gas chromatography to evaluate the changes in concentration of major <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26666">short chain fatty acids</z:chebi> (SCFAs), namely <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">n-butyrate</z:chebi>, iso-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>, in the above samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Student t test and Graph pad prism-6 were used to compare the data statistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant decrease of Clostridium coccoides (control, 25.69% ± 1.62% vs severe, 9.8% ± 2.4%, P = 0.0001) and Clostridium leptum clusters (control, 13.74% ± 1.05% vs severe, 6.2% ± 1.8%, P = 0.0001) in fecal samples of UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we demonstrated that some <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>-producing members of the clostridial cluster, like Fecalibacterium prausnitzii (control, 11.66% ± 1.55% vs severe, 6.01% ± 1.6%, P = 0.0001) and Roseburia intestinalis (control, 14.48% ± 1.52% vs severe, 9% ± 1.83%, P = 0.02) were differentially present in patients with different disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, we also demonstrated decreased concentrations of fecal SCFAs, especially of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">n-butyrate</z:chebi> (control, 24.32 ± 1.86 mmol/μL vs severe, 12.74 ± 2.75 mmol/μL, P = 0.003), iso-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> (control, 1.70 ± 0.41 mmol/μL vs severe, 0.68 ± 0.24 mmol/μL, P = 0.0441) and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (control, 39.51 ± 1.76 mmol/μL vs severe, 32.12 ± 2.95 mmol/μL, P = 0.047), in the fecal samples of UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The observed decrease of predominant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> producers of clostridial clusters correlated with the reduced SCFA levels in active UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This was further confirmed by the restoration in the population of some <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> producers with simultaneous increase in the level of SCFA in remission samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our observations indicate that decreases in members of the clostridial cluster resulting in reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> levels contribute to the etiology of UC </plain></SENT>
