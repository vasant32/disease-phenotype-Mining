<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we wished to see if lymphoid cells derived from the lamina propria of surgically resected bowel specimens have any modulatory effect upon the immune response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When autologous peripheral blood and intestinal lamina propria lymphoid cells were mixed at different ratios and cultured in the presence of phytohaemagglutinin, we were able to show that intestinal mononuclear cells had the capacity to modify the mitogenic response of the cultured cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These intestinal immunoregulatory cells, when obtained from mucosa affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, express a significantly enhanced suppressor cell activity as compared with those from non-inflamed control mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such suppressor cell activity varies with cell concentration and requires cell proliferation, but it is independent of anatomical origin (small vs large bowel), type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> vs <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>) or immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings point to an important functional difference between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> and control intestinal mucosa mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The enhanced suppressor activity of lamina propria mononuclear cells may be associated with impairment of cell-mediated immunity at the gut level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This may be related to the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> by leading to defective intestinal immune regulatory events, which may not be detectable at the peripheral level </plain></SENT>
