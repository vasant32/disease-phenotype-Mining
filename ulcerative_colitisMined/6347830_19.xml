<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The findings have been compared with those in 39 healthy subjects who were matched for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ileostomists were found to lose excessive quantities of water and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> in the ileostomy effluent compared with the corresponding losses in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> faeces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean plasma total protein and albumin concentrations were increased in the ileostomists suggesting a state of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The daily urinary output of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> was low and the output of <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> was high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The urinary pH was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ileostomists had raised mean concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> in the plasma (p less than 0.001) and it is suggested that this is responsible for the body's partial compensation for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> and water, including the so-called ileostomy adaptation </plain></SENT>
