<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this pilot, prospective, multicenter randomized trial, 20 patients with moderately active steroid-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> were randomized to 5 or 10 granulocyteaphaeresis sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary objective was clinical remission at wk 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary measures included endoscopic remission and steroid consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine patients were randomized to 5 granulocyteaphaeresis sessions (group 1) and 11 patients to 10 granulocyteaphaeresis sessions (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At wk 17, 37.5% of patients in group 1 and 45.45% of patients in group 2 were in clinical remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical remission was accompanied by endoscopic remission in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighty-six percent of patients achieving remission were steroid-free at wk 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Daily steroid requirements were significantly lower in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eighty-nine per cent of patients remained in remission during a one year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One serious adverse event, not related to the study therapy, was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Granulocyteaphaeresis is safe and effective for the treatment of steroid-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this population, increasing the number of aphaeresis sessions is not associated with higher remission rates, but affords a significant steroid-sparing effect </plain></SENT>
