<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The prebiotic potential of lactulose is well established and preclinical studies demonstrated a protective effect of lactulose in murine models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical and histological efficacy of lactulose in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD), for which probiotic therapy yielded promising results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were treated with standard medication alone or combined with 10 g lactulose daily as adjuvant therapy for 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical efficacy of treatment was assessed using clinical activity indices, a quality of life index (IBDQ), endoscopic scores, defecation frequency and monitoring <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Orsomucoid, alpha1-antitrypsin and other laboratory parameters were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, in some participants colonic biopsies were analyzed with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin staining or with antibodies against HLA-DR, CD68, IgA and CD3, and evaluated systematically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> measurements were performed both at enrollment and at the end of the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 14 patients presenting <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and 17 patients presenting <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), most of them in a clinically active state, were enrolled in this pilot study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 4 month no significant improvement of clinical activity index, endoscopic score or immunohistochemical parameters was observed in CD or UC patients receiving lactulose in comparison to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, significant improvement of quality of life was observed in UC patients receiving lactulose compared to the control group (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings of the present pilot study indicate that oral lactulose has no beneficial effects in IBD patients in particular with regard to clinical activity, endoscopic score or immunohistochemical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The importance of the beneficial effect of lactulose in UC patients regarding the quality of life needs further evaluation in larger controlled clinical trials </plain></SENT>
