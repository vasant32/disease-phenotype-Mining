<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An increasing number of cases of C difficile <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> occur in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD)-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate the potential excess morbidity and mortality associated with C difficile in hospitalised patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2003) were analysed and outcomes were examined of patients hospitalised with both C difficile <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and IBD compared with those hospitalised for either condition alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A subgroup analysis was also performed comparing outcomes of C difficile <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in patients with CD and UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 2804 discharges were diagnosed as having both C difficile and IBD, 44,400 as having C difficile alone, and 77,366 as having IBD alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, patients in the C difficile-IBD group had a four times greater mortality than patients admitted to hospital for IBD alone (aOR = 4.7, 95% CI 2.9 to 7.9) or C difficile alone (aOR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.4 to 3.4), and stayed in the hospital for three days longer (95% CI 2.3 to 3.7 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher mortality, endoscopy and surgery rates were found in patients with UC compared with CD (p&lt;0.05), but no significant difference in length of stay or median hospital charge between the two groups was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: C difficile <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> is associated with a significant healthcare burden in hospitalised patients with IBD and carries a higher mortality than in patients with C difficile without underlying IBD </plain></SENT>
