<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: An uncontrolled pilot study demonstrated that daclizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody to the interleukin 2 receptor (CD25), might be effective for the treatment of active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of daclizumab induction therapy in patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 159 patients with moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> were randomised to receive induction therapy with daclizumab 1 mg/kg intravenously at weeks 0 and 4, or 2 mg/kg intravenously at weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6, or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was induction of remission at week 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Remission was defined as a Mayo score of 0 on both endoscopy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> components and a score of 0 or 1 on stool frequency and physician's global assessment components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Response was defined as a decrease from baseline in the Mayo score of at least 3 points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two per cent of patients receiving daclizumab 1 mg/kg (p = 0.11 v placebo) and 7% of patients receiving 2 mg/kg (p = 0.73) were in remission at week 8, compared with 10% of those who received placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Response occurred at week 8 in 25% of patients receiving daclizumab 1 mg/kg (p = 0.04) and in 33% of patients receiving 2 mg/kg (p = 0.30) versus 44% of those receiving placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Daclizumab was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most frequently reported adverse events in daclizumab treated patients compared with placebo treated patients were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027441" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nasopharyngitis</z:e> (14.6%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>pyrexia</z:hpo> (10.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> who are treated with daclizumab are not more likely to be in remission or response at eight weeks than patients treated with placebo </plain></SENT>
