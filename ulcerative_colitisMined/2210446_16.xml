<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously described a 40 kDa colonic protein(s) which is specifically recognised by tissue-bound immunoglobulin G obtained from the colon of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We now report the presence of circulating antibodies against this antigen using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with a highly enriched preparation of the 40 kDa protein from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum was collected from 79 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, 36 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 16 with specific diarrhoeal syndromes, and from 19 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty nine of 79 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, 21 of 36 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with diarrhoea were symptomatic during the collection of sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference in optical density values between patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and each of the other groups, including patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in remission, was highly significant (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy nine per cent of patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> had optical density values above the means for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty five per cent of sera from patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> had optical densities beyond two SDs of the values for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups and only two of 71 sera from non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients (one <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subject) had values in this range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results show the presence of anti-colon antibodies against the 40 kDa protein(s) in the sera of many patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
