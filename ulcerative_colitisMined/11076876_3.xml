<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) includes <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, both of which are multifactorial diseases involving the interaction of genetic and environmental factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A region on chromosome 12 centred around the marker locus D12S83 has previously been associated with IBD predisposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to investigate this genetic region in an independent panel of European families affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A sample of 95 families with two or more affected relatives and 75 simplex nuclear families were genotyped for 19 microsatellite loci located on chromosome 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A search for linkage and linkage disequilibrium was performed using non-parametric two point and multipoint analyses with the Analyze and Genehunter packages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No evidence of linkage or linkage disequilibrium was observed for any of the marker loci, including D12S83 (p=0.35 for the two point linkage test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multipoint linkage analysis also failed to reveal positive linkage on chromosome 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Power calculations allowed us to reject the hypothesis that the genetic region of chromosome 12 centred on D12S83 contains a susceptibility locus with a relative risk (lambda(s)) equal to or greater than 2.0 in these families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Failure to detect linkage or linkage disequilibrium in these families suggests that the chromosome 12 locus previously reported to be associated with genetic predisposition to IBD does not play a role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> European family samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This observation is compatible with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the genetic basis of susceptibility to the disease and/or exposure to various environmental factors among Caucasian families </plain></SENT>
