<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is of major interest to supplement this with a functional analysis of the microbiota </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this review, the different approaches that have been used to characterize microbial metabolites, yielding information on the functional end products of microbial metabolism, have been summarized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To analyze colonic microbial metabolites, the most conventional way is by application of a hypothesis-driven targeted approach, through quantification of selected metabolites from carbohydrate (e.g., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26666">short-chain fatty acids</z:chebi>) and protein fermentation (e.g., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17847">p-cresol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi>, ammonia, or H(2)S), secondary <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi>, or colonic enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The application of stable isotope-labeled substrates can provide an elegant solution to study these metabolic pathways in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, a top-down approach can be followed by applying metabolite fingerprinting techniques based on (1)H-NMR or mass spectrometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantification of known metabolites and characterization of metabolite patterns in urine, breath, plasma, and fecal samples can reveal new pathways and give insight into physiological regulatory processes of the colonic microbiota </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, specific metabolic profiles can function as a diagnostic tool for the identification of several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal diseases</z:e>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, future research will have to evaluate the relevance of associations between metabolites and different <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
