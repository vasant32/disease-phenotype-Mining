<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorders</z:e> of the intestine are characterised by enhanced expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNF-alpha) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Monocytes and macrophages have been suggested as a major cellular source of TNF-alpha in human gut, whereas mast cells, although known to be capable of producing TNF-alpha, have been poorly examined in this respect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To investigate whether human intestinal mast cells can produce TNF-alpha, and which factors regulate TNF-alpha production in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mast cells were isolated from surgery tissue specimens of patients undergoing bowel resection because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies were performed in biopsy specimens derived from 13 patients (two healthy controls, four with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, four with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, three others) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression were studied in vitro by polymerase chain reaction, RNAse protection assay, western blot, and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay in isolated purified human intestinal mast cells stimulated by IgE receptor crosslinking, intestinal bacteria, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cellular localisation of TNF-alpha was examined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TNF-alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein were expressed constitutively in isolated human intestinal mast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression of TNF-alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and release of TNF-alpha protein were substantially enhanced by IgE receptor crosslinking and by coculture of mast cells with intestinal bacteria; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> had only marginal effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies revealed that approximately 60% of the lamina propria cells with immunoreactivity for TNF-alpha were mast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data show that mast cells are an important source of TNF-alpha in the human intestinal mucosa </plain></SENT>
