<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the safety of pegylated interferon alpha (PegIFN) and its role in induction of remission in patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, in a multicentre placebo controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty patients with a clinical activity score (CAI) of &gt;6 were randomised to receive placebo (n=20), PegIFN 0.5 microg/kg (n=19), or PegIFN 1.0 microg/kg body weight (n=21) once weekly (PegIntron; Schering-Plough, USA) over 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="20551">5-aminosalicylates</z:chebi>, steroids, and/or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> in stable dosages were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serious adverse events were seen in none of the placebo patients, in 3/19 patients in the PegIFN 0.5 microg/kg group (hospitalisation due to disease flare up n=3), and in 3/21 in the PegIFN 1.0 microg/kg group (hospitalisation due to disease flare up n=1; <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> n=1; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014549,C0494475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Sign or Symptom" abbrv="">grand mal</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, we observed only minor IFN-alpha side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical remission rates at week 12 (CAI &lt; or =4) were 7/20 (35%) in the placebo, 9/19 (47%) in the PegIFN 0.5 microg/kg group, and 7/21 (33%) in the PegIFN 1.0 microg/kg group (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early withdrawal from the study was observed in 11/20 placebo patients, in 6/19 in the PegIFN 0.5 microg/kg group, and in 10/21 in the PegIFN 1.0 microg/kg group, mainly due to lack of efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The higher PegIFN dose was associated with a significant decrease in levels of C reactive protein (p=0.003, day 0 v 85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PegIFN is safe but not effective, at the dosages used, in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
