<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic complication rates in pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are unknown, and adult safety data are of limited applicability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed a prospectively enrolled cohort of children (aged 1 month-18 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> AIS selected using standardized criteria for protocol-based ACT over 14-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assessed ACT-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>), including frequency, clinical and radiologic characteristics, predictors, and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 215 children with AIS, 123 received ACT within 7 days after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During anticoagulation, 14 (11%) children developed new or increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> within 26 days from diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> was symptomatic in 5 (4%), asymptomatic in 9 (7%), and mild (European Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Study grades HI1 or HI2) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 1 child (ECASS PH-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Long-term neurologic outcomes after ACT-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> in survivors were abnormal in 73% (8/11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comparably, 12 of 75 (16%) children treated without anticoagulation developed new or increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> on follow-up imaging (P = .3507) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that ACT is relatively safe in children with AIS, with a 4% risk of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Based on the safety of ACT in our study, clinical trials of ACT in childhood AIS are warranted </plain></SENT>
