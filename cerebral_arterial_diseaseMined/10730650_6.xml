<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During the past 8 years, 18 children with idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and catheter angiography; 17 were also studied with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was done within 34 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients underwent catheter angiography within 36 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging; 12 studies were performed within 22 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients underwent catheter angiography, in both cases within 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> were compared with arterial abnormalities seen at catheter angiography, and the results of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography were compared with those seen at catheter angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Comparing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography with catheter angiography, we found the positive predictive value of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> was 100%, with a negative predictive value of 88% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography was equivalent to catheter angiography in the detection and depiction of proximal middle <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral artery disease</z:e>; however, depiction of disease in the internal carotid artery (ICA) and detection of peripheral embolic disease were better with catheter angiography than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Basal ganglia lesions associated with ICA disease by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography should probably be studied with digital subtraction angiography, as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography did not depict the length and severity of ICA disease as well as catheter angiography did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> should be studied with catheter angiography, as emboli may occur in the absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>; the circle of Willis may be uninvolved with embolic disease, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography is not sensitive to emboli in small peripheral intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
