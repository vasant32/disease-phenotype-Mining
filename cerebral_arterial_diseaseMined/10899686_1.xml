<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Super Pulse technique can maintain the systolic pressure and systolic-diastolic amplitude in such a way that they mimic the physiologic circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-five patients (33 males and 12 females, mean age 65.1 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> who had a greater than 75% stenosis of the carotid or intracranial arteries were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evaluation was performed for the following 3 groups: 8 patients with conventional pulsatile CPB (Group I), 8 patients with conventional pulsatile CPB plus intraaortic balloon pumping (Group II), and 29 patients with Super Pulse CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Maximum, minimum, and mean perfusion pressures during CPB were 112.7, 53.6, and 76.9 mmHg (integrated mean), respectively, in Group III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The systolic-diastolic amplitude was significantly better than for Group I and similar to baseline pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patients in Group II or Group III developed perioperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0234387" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral disorders</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, while in Group I perioperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0234387" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral disorders</z:e> developed in 3 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> occurred in 2 patients, and 2 patients died during hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The initial performance of the Super Pulse CPB indicates excellent safety, and is useful for patients with co-morbid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
