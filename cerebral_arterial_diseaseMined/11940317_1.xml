<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 81 of diabetic patients and 62 age-, gender- matched healthy controls were monitored with TCD in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pulsatility index (PI) and mean flow velocities (Vm) between the patients and healthy controls, between the patients with microangiopathic complications and patients without complication, were analyzed respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53232">PIs</z:chebi> of arteries and Vms of the extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA), middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and basilar artery (BA) were significantly higher in diabetic patients than those in healthy controls (P &lt; 0.001), while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53232">PIs</z:chebi> of ICA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> but not BA were significantly increased in patients with complications than those in noncomplicated patients (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It indicated that PI and Vm might be two useful markers for the detection of diabetic cerebrovascular changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Marked increase of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53232">PIs</z:chebi> of ICA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> might reflect the microangiopathic changes of cerebral vessels in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
