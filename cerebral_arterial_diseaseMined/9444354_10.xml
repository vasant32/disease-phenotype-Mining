<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Six cases of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> are presented in which the cellular changes accompanying descending degeneration of the lateral corticospinal tract were studied at different time points (5 days-10 years) following the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microglia and perivascular cells were found to ingest large amounts of myelin degradation products, while expressing high levels of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Activation of perivascular macrophages, as indicated by increased class II expression, lasted for many years and appeared to follow down-regulation of both phagocytic activity and class II expression on parenchymal microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TUNEL labeling was absent from both microglia and perivascular cells at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indirect evidence is presented that microglia may transfer myelin degradation products to the perivascular space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Perivascular cells which express MHC class II molecules constitutively do not appear to leave the perivascular compartment in large numbers and could release myelin degradation products into the cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The possible immunological consequences of these findings are discussed with respect to their possible relevance for antigen presentation and autoimmune central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disease </plain></SENT>
