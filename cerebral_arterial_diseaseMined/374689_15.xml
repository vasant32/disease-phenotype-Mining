<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and regional cerebral oxygen utilization (rCMRO2) were measured before and after surgery in nine patients undergoing a superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis to bypass cerebrovascular lesions not amenable to extracranial operative procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of these studies was to determine whether measurements of this type could provide objective criteria for surgery as well as assess the effect of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The preliminary data, although limited, suggest that measurements of regional cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism in these patients before and after surgery provide valuable data upon which to develop criteria and assess results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For example, 1) a significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of rCBF and rCMRO2 in patients in whom a major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> has not occurred, or 2) relative preservation of rCMRO2 despite depressed rCBF seem to be favorable indications for establishing a functioning STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In such patients, STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis can be followed by a return of rCBJ and rCMRO2 to virtually <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relatively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rCBF and rCMRO2 in the presence of an occluded internal carotid artery in asymptomatic patients indicates satisfactory collateral circulation and is probably a contraindication to surgery </plain></SENT>
