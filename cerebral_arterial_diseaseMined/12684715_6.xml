<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We looked at these aspects in a collaborative study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed 13 patients diagnosed as having a dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> based on clinical signs and neuroradiological findings in 46 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> centres between 1995 and 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were four patients who presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e>, and nine who presented with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the former group, three were aged less than 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography showed extensive stenosis and a double lumen of the M1 portion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High signal on T1-weighted images around the arterial flow void, due to intramural haematoma, was often seen in the second week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography showed findings corresponding those of intra-arterial angiography in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We saw an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> on CT or MRI in territory of the perforating branches of the M1 segment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the patients presenting with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, pure <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> or a sylvian fissure haematoma was seen on initial CT, and the predominant angiographic finding was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> with stenosis, but the site of the lesions was not uniform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A double lumen or intimal flap was seen in about half the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Rebleeding occurred within 14 days of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in five of the nine patients, with a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
