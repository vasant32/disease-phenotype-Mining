<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to compare the image quality of two-dimensional (2D) digital subtraction angiography (DSA) between a flat panel detector (FPD) of the direct conversion type with low radiation dose and a conventional image intensifier (I.I.)-TV system, and to assess 3D DSA with the FPD system in the depiction of intracranial vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifteen consecutive patients (five men, ten women; age range: 18-82 years; mean age: 55.5 years) were prospectively included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent 2D DSA with both the FPD and I.I.-TV system in one projection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The radiation doses during angiography were evaluated using a phantom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 3D DSA images were created from the rotational DSA data with the FPD system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two blinded radiologists independently evaluated 2D DSA with the FPD system and I.I.-TV system using a 5-point assessment scale (excellent to not visible) to assess the depiction of intracranial vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MIP and volume rendering (VR) images of 3D DSA with the FPD system were also evaluated using a 5-point scale (excellent to not visible) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DSA and fluoroscopy dose measurements with the phantom showed a dose reduction of approximately 85% and 9% with the FPD system compared with the I.I.-TV system, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For 2D DSA, the FPD system was significantly superior to the I.I.-TV system with respect to the visibility of the peripheral and perforating vessels (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The peripheral and perforating vessels were also sufficiently visualized on MIP images of 3D DSA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 15 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our FPD system was found to be superior to the I.I.-TV system in visualizing small intracranial vessels combined with a significant reduction of radiation dose, and was able to create high-quality 3D DSA images on which high spatial resolution allowed precise visualization of small vessels such as perforating ones </plain></SENT>
