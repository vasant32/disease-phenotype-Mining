<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To make a quantitative analysis of cerebral vasoreactivity in individual major arterial territories, we evaluated the response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> using three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined 10 healthy volunteers and 6 patients with unilateral stenosis of the middle cerebral artery by a 1.5-T superconducting magnetic resonance imaging system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a baseline vascular image was obtained, each subject received 17 mg/kg IV of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>; a second scan was performed 20 minutes later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a generally available personal computer and image analysis software, we measured the areas of the individual major arteries on collapsed axial vascular images and then calculated the vasoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average vasoreactivity of individual major cerebral arterial territories in the healthy volunteers was as follows: anterior cerebral artery complex, 33%; right middle cerebral artery, 71%; left middle cerebral artery, 74%; right posterior cerebral artery, 68%; and left posterior cerebral artery, 68% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the patient group, the vasoreactivity of the stenotic middle cerebral arteries was significantly smaller than that of the nonstenotic arteries (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the nonstenotic middle cerebral arteries showed significantly less vasoreactivity than the right arteries of the healthy volunteers (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography can be used to quantitatively evaluate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>-induced vasoreactivity in individual major cerebral arterial territories </plain></SENT>
