<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subject motion can severely deteriorate the quality and accuracy of results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A correction method for T*(2) maps acquired with multi-slice multiple gradient echo FLASH imaging is presented, based on acquisition repetition with reduced spatial resolution (and consequently reduced acquisition time) and weighted averaging of both data sets, choosing weighting factors individually for each k-space line to reduce the influence of motion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In detail, the procedure is based on the fact that motion artifacts reduce the correlation between acquired and exponentially fitted data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A target data set is constructed in image space, choosing the data yielding best correlation from the two acquired data sets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The k-space representation of the target is subsequently approximated as linear combination of original raw data, yielding the required weighting factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As this method only requires a single acquisition repetition with reduced spatial resolution, it can be employed on any clinical system offering a suitable sequence with export of modulus and phase images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Experimental results show that the method works well for sparse motion, but fails for strong motion affecting the same k-space lines in both acquisitions </plain></SENT>
