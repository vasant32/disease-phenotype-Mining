<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Transcranial stab injuries remain a frequent cause of emergent neurosurgical admissions to neurosurgical units in South Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brainstem stabs are an uncommon, yet often fatal, form of brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective audit of 597 patients with transcranial stab injuries admitted to our unit over a 12-year period (January 1987 to December 1998) identified 17 patients (2.85%) with brainstem stab injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The computed tomographic scans of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were analyzed, and a detailed autopsy examination of the skull and its contents was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stepwise linear regression analysis was used to formulate a predictive model of outcome for the entire series of 597 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The majority of the patients were males (16 patients), and the study group had a mean age of 28.65 +/- 9.59 years and a mean Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score of 8.59 +/- 2.76 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Knives (82%) were the most common instruments of penetration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography identified 3 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo>, and autopsy revealed an additional 4 patients with vascular injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Emergency ventriculostomy was performed in 10 patients for obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four of the 17 patients survived (76.5% mortality) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Factors significantly predictive of outcome in patients with transcranial stab injuries were the Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score (F = 43.7), the occurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> (F = 22.8), the type of associated lesion (intracranial bleed, vascular abnormality, or brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>) (F = 5.9), and the number of operations (F = 3.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score is the most significant predictor of outcome in low-velocity transcranial stab injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Brainstem stab injuries have a great propensity for vascular damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Survivors are incapacitated by severe, fixed neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
