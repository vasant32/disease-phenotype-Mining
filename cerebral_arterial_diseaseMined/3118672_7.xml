<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative neuroangiography was performed on 53 occasions in 43 patients using a portable imaging system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two procedures were performed for diagnostic purposes after resection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo>, clipping of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, or carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unexpected problems were disclosed in seven cases and were surgically remedied immediately in four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, angiography was used as a therapeutic tool in 21 cases to facilitate intraoperative embolization of a vascular lesion or to enable the angioplasty of a vessel inaccessible without direct surgical exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that by allowing a combined interventional neuroangiographic and neurosurgical approach, intraoperative angiography opened new avenues for treatment of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
