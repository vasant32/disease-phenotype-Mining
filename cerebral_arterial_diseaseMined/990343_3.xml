<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A feedback method for testing the reactivity of the occipital-parietal EEG in selected brain-lesioned patients revealed abnormalities of (a) insufficient reactivity, (b) bilateral differences in reactivity, and (3) asynchrony </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities were more evident during feedback stimulation than in the baseline conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The utility of feedback method for detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>EEG abnormalities</z:hpo> rests on the increased stability or decreased "noisy" variation in the EEG during feedback </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The EEG becomes more predictable even to the "on-line" human observer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This makes it easier to detect aberrations or deviations from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some effects can only be seen with feedback such as the bilateral differences which occur when the left side controls the feedback compared to when the right side controls it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results show that feedback EEG is a useful tool in clinical research and indicate that a clinical diagnostic test could be developed with more research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the feedback EEG method is not yet a proven diagnostic technique </plain></SENT>
