<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report our experience with endovascular treatment of posterior circulation fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of our prospectively maintained database identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> posterior circulation fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated by endovascular approach over a 6-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical charts, procedural data, and angiographic results were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From March 2004 to March 2010, 31 patients were identified: 11 asymptomatic patients, 9 who presented with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, 6 with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and 5 with a mass effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but 1 patient (97%), who died before being treated, were successfully treated by parent <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (n = 10), stenting plus coiling (n = 10), or stenting alone with conventional or flow-diverting stents (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients showed a good or an excellent outcome (73%); 3 had a fair or a poor outcome (10%); and 5 patients died (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These 8 patients initially presented with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> or mass effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Procedure-related morbidity includes only one patient who kept a worsening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no definitive procedure-related morbidity or mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immediate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> occlusion was incomplete in 20 cases (67%) and complete in 10 cases (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up of 20 months in 23 patients showed 12 further thromboses, 9 stable results, and 2 flow reductions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Final results included 19 complete occlusions (83%) and 4 incomplete occlusions (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Posterior circulation fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> may be treated by different endovascular approaches with satisfying clinical and anatomical results in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, patients who present with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> or mass effect still have a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
