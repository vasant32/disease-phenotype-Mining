<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Findings were as follows: The incidence was about double that so far published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Small ID, usually triangular in shape, tended to become round as it grew larger (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Large ID favored young age (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In internal carotid-posterior communicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (IC-P com An) cases, a high incidence of ID was noted as compared to other An cases (P less than 0.05), and intermediate or large, round ID accounted for high ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> showed a high large ID ratio (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cases with well developed P com A had a high ratio of large, round ID (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In cases with a large divergent angle of ICA and P com A, intermediate or large, round ID was found in high ratio (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aggressive follow-up or treatment was thought necessary in cases which possess the factors mentioned </plain></SENT>
