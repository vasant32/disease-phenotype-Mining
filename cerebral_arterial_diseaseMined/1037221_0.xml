<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>10 mg doses of Cavinton were given as infusion within 4-6 min; circulatory tests were carried out prior to administration of the drug and 3-6 min after </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The principal results showed the following: On Cavinton cerebral vascular resistance was strongly reduced, while cerebral fraction of cardiac output significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> effect of the drug arterial mean pressure slightly decreased but cerebral blood flow nevertheless increased in general </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total vascular resistance also decreased but this decrease was less marked than that registered in cerebral vascular resistance </plain></SENT>
