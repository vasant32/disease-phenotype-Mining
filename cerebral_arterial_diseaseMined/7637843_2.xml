<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was a 79-year-old man referred to our department with an episode of consciousness disturbance and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography scan showed intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> in the left frontal lobe, combined with left frontal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiography revealed dAVM in the left anterior fossa, fed by the bilateral ethmoidal and the bilateral middle meningeal arteries, and draining into the superior and inferior sinuses through the pial veins with vascular sacs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While angiography revealed an occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (M1 portion) good collaterals via leptomeningeal anastomosis had developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T1-weighted magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) images showed an intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> as a low intensity area, and flow-void areas were indicative of vascular sacs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Time-of-flight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography also clearly showed dAVM in the left anterior fossa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Co-existence of an occlusion of an intracranial major artery and dAVM in this location has not been reported previously and it was speculated that this association had occurred by chance </plain></SENT>
