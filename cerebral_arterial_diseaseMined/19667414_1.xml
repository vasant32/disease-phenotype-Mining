<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to identify possible risk factors associated with a lack of response to aspirin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> treatments in patients with coronary or cerebral ischemic artery disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A point-of-care analyzer, VerifyNow (Accumetrics, San Diego, CA), was used to measure <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>-5-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> and platelet P2YI2 receptor blockage to investigate the responses of a group of 197 patients to aspirin and/ or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> therapies (aspirin therapy, 178; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> therapy, 139; both drugs, 144) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these 197 patients, 135 (68.5%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and 72 (31.5%) had ischemic cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aspirin resistance was defined as an ARU (aspirin reaction units) &gt; or =550, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> resistance was defined as platelet inhibition &lt;20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five of 178 aspirin users (14.0%) were resistant to aspirin, and 54 of 139 (38.8%) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> users were resistant to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) level in aspirin users and high systolic and diastolic blood pressures in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> users are significantly related to treatment resistance (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The latter finding is possibly due to the greater adhesiveness and increased aggregability of platelets in hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
