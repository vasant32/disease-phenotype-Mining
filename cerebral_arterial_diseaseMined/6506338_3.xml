<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cerebral arterial gas embolism was induced in 23 dogs that were then treated using one of six routines: no treatment; air at 2.8 bar (60 ft) for 2 min; air at 10 bar (300 ft) for 5 min; oxygen at 2.8 bar for 10 or 20 min; and air at 6 bar (165 ft) for 10 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After decompression they were monitored for a total of 90 min after the time of embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dogs then underwent an autoradiographic study of cerebral blood flow (CBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A number of the air-treated dogs experienced a reduction in cortical evoked potential after decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dogs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, except the untreated group and the dog at 10 bar for 5 min, showed an improved CBF compared with their short-study counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After compression treatment, CBF improved with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Function in 7 dogs deteriorated to a variable small degree in the air-treated groups, while only 3 dogs in the group on oxygen for 10 min deteriorated by around 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CBF of the oxygen groups was close to the undived control values, and their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressures had returned to control levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a dissociation between improving CBF and deteriorating function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is evident that secondary deterioration is a random affair and therefore not easily studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of the four-part series are summarized and discussed </plain></SENT>
