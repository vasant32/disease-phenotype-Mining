<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe clinical and sonographic patterns that are associated with tandem internal carotid artery (ICA) and middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients receiving intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment NIHSS scores and bedside transcranial Doppler (TCD) were obtained for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 95 patients treated with intravenous <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> at 132+/-60 minutes from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On TCD, 48 had isolated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (mean NIHSS 16.8+/-5.8, median 17, range 5 to 28); and 16 had tandem ICA/<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (mean NIHSS 18.8+/-5.8, median 22, range 8 to 29; P=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and tandem ICA/<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion groups, 19% and 11%, respectively, had NIHSS scores &lt;12 points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with the NIHSS scores in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>, forced gaze deviation, and complete neglect, the lower NIHSS scores were attributable to partial arm and/or leg <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp>, gaze preference, and partial neglect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In those patients, TCD showed &gt; or =2 major collateral channels and low-resistance flow at the M1 origin, suggesting perfusion of perforating arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although TCD cannot differentiate between high-grade ICA stenosis or occlusion, collateral flow patterns and stenotic signals at the terminal ICA differentiated tandem lesions from isolated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Tandem ICA/<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion was found on TCD in 17% of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>NIHSS scores were similar in patients with isolated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and tandem occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Lower NIHSS scores were seen in patients with a higher number of major collateral flow channels and higher Thrombolysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain Ischemia</z:e> (TIBI) flow grades at the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> origin </plain></SENT>
