<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is the most frequent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> over 3 cm long, especially, if those <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are localized in the vicinity of cerebral liquor ducts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> exceeding 2 cm develop hemorrhagic complications in 2/3 of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While using modern treatment methods (stereotaxic and intravascular) one should take into account the peculiarities of the structure of large and giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in the brain </plain></SENT>
