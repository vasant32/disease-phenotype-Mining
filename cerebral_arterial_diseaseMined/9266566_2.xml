<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> disappeared spontaneously shortly after performing STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 54-year-old female was admitted to our hospital because of repeated attacks of right hemisensory disturbance and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT scan and MRI images showed the infarcted focus in the left parieto-occipital lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> were undetectable on MRI images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography revealed that the bilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> were occluded in their proximal origin with basal abnormal vascular networks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branches were perfused via the vascular networks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A small <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was detected in the distal portion of the left Heubner's artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no abnormalities in the bilateral internal carotid arteries, the anterior cerebral arteries, and the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The follow-up angiography performed 29 days after admission revealed a growing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with a diameter of 3 mm in the distal enhanced lesion consistent with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> observed in the angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis was performed for improvement of cerebral misery perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission tomography (SPECT) performed 9 days after the bypass operation revealed improvement of cerebral blood flow in the left parieto-occipital lobe, and her <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> attacks disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was undetected in the cerebral angiography performed 24 days after the bypass operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion is a rare condition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cerebrovascular occlusive diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic criteria of the disease includes the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusions or stenosis with basal abnormal vascular networks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Usually the phenomenon is seen unilaterally, which differs from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis must exclude diseases caused by the etiologies such as those of arteriosclerotic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>There have been 24 reported cases of spontaneous <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion including our case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Among them, 9 cases presented <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> located in abnormal vascular networks, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the reported cases presented <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> at their <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The abnormal basal vascular network may be developed as collateral vessels to supply blood to the ischemic regions in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>An increased hemodynamic stress in the abnormal basal vascular network may produce a true <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in the distal portion of the perforating arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis reduced the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> attacks, but also decreased the hemodynamic stress on the abnormal basal vascular network and resulted in reduction in size or <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis can be considered effective to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> located in vessels with increased hemodynamic stress </plain></SENT>
