<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, the authors investigated the feasibility, safety, and short-term outcome of stent-assisted angioplasty for the treatment of intracranial stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-four patients (age range, 12-77 years; mean age, 54 years) with symptomatic intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> and dissections that produced stenosis of more than 50% were selected and treated with stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighteen lesions (53%) were located in the anterior circulation, and 16 (47%) were in the vertebrobasilar complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean stenosis was 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At follow up, 21 patients (62%) improved clinically, 11 (32%) remained stable, and the condition of two patients (6%) deteriorated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, the angiographic degree of stenosis was reduced to less than 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 10 patients (29%), two or more stents were implanted: Two stents were implanted in six patients, and three, in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The transient procedural morbidity rate was 12%, and the transient neurologic morbidity rate was 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient had hemorrhagic transformation due to reperfusion and died, and another patient had a massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> after 5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients were followed up with angiography for at least 6 months, and none required repeat angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endovascular revascularization of intracranial arteries by means of stent-assisted angioplasty is technically feasible, effective, and safe in selected patients </plain></SENT>
