<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The coincidence of hemodynamic and embolic findings in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from large <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> has suggested an interaction of both pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This has emerged into the hypothesis of an impaired washout of emboli in the presence of hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We propose an additional link between both pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF CASE: A 48-year-old woman presented with a recurrent symptomatic severe left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI depicted left hemispheric ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the deep and subcortical white matter and in the cortical border zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One-hour transcranial Doppler monitoring detected 64 microembolic signals distal to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Monitoring also revealed recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation at the stenotic plaque with decline of poststenotic flow velocity followed by embolism with abrupt excessive flow velocity increase and subsequent normalization at the initial baseline level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular reserve in the distribution territory of the stenosed artery as assessed by transcranial Doppler after carbon dioxide stimulation revealed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> reserve capacity in periods with baseline poststenotic flow velocity and an exhausted reserve capacity when flow velocity was decreased due to stenotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our patient, adherent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation resulted in an increasing severity of the stenosis with subsequent vasodilatation and diminution of flow resistance in the depending vascular distribution territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MRI suggested that adherent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were predominantly washed into terminal supply and border zone brain regions, ie, into regions with supposed maximum vasodilatation and least flow resistance immediately before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_625'>avulsion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Preferred wash-in of emboli into regions with low blood flow resistance might be an additional mechanism besides impaired washout in patients with severe large artery disease </plain></SENT>
