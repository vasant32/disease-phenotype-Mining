<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have examined Notch3 mutations in patients with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> with subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> (CADASIL) whose samples were submitted to us in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects were composed of 21 Japanese, 1 Iranian, 1 Korean and 1 Canadian families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the Notch3 gene were found in 7 of 24 families examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These were R133C in two unrelated Japanese families, and R213K, C174F and R169C in each Japanese family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we have found R90C in an Iranian family and C174R in a Korean family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, contribution of Notch3 gene mutations is less than one fourth of Japanese CADASIL families, suggesting the existence of other causative genes in CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is also of interest to know that Notch3 mutant CADASIL exists in other Asian countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We next examined the localization of Notch3 protein in the tissue by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was restricted to the wall of arterioles in the brain and other organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the brain, there was no difference in the staining pattern among arterioles in the cortex, white matter and meninges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The staining was negative in the venule and capillaries as well as in neurons and glial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>From the staining pattern, it was recognized to be expressed in the vascular smooth muscle cells in the adult tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In an autopsy case with R213K mutation, we could see numerous cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and arteriole wall degeneration with deposits of granular osmiophilic material (GOM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, it is interesting to note that occlusion of arterioles was rarely observed and the GOM was negative for Notch3 staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that hemodynamic abnormalities due to smooth muscle cell degeneration may be important in the pathogenesis of CADASIL </plain></SENT>
