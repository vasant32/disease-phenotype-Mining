<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The complement system is the key mediator of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and household processing of injured tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied how complement activation associates with SCAA wall degeneration and rupture to better understand the pathobiology of SCAA wall rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Unruptured (n = 26) and ruptured (n = 32) SCAA fundi resected after microsurgical clipping were studied by immunostaining for complement activation (membrane attack complex [MAC]) and by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> nick end-labeling reaction for related cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complement activation was correlated with clinical and other histological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electromicroscopy and immunoelectron microscopy were used for locating MAC depositions at the ultrastructural level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MAC localized consistently in a decellularized layer in the outer SCAA wall, and was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SCAA samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percentage of MAC-positive area relative to the total SCAA wall surface area (range, 5-77%) was greater in ruptured (n = 25; median, 39%) than in unruptured SCAAs (n = 18; median, 20%; P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It also associated significantly with SCAA wall degeneration (P &lt; 0.001), de-endothelialization(P &lt; 0.001), and CD163+ macrophage (P = 0.023) and T-lymphocyte (P = 0.030) infiltrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> nick end-labeling-positive nuclei and MAC were located at the same wall areas in four out of 14 double-stained samples, but no double-positive cells were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Electromicroscopy and immunoelectron microscopy of an unruptured SCAA showed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the MAC-positive layers in the outer SCAA wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggests that complement activation and MAC formation are involved in SCAA wall degeneration and rupture </plain></SENT>
