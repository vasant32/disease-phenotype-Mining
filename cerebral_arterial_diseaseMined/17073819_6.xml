<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological studies point to a beneficial influence of the female reproductive hormones on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk in that women have a lower incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prior to the menopause compared with men, but this difference weakens with age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk in women rises after the menopause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recent Women's Health Initiative trials in post-menopausal women report an increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk on hormone replacement therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An influence of gender is also apparent on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome in animal models: female rats exposed to transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (middle cerebral artery) occlusion sustain less brain damage than age-matched males, with loss of protection following ovariectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The major hormone thought to be responsible for beneficial influences on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence and outcome is <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi>, and a large preclinical literature now exists where exogenously administered <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> has been studied in male and ovariectomized female rats using a range of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models and outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most of these studies administer <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> prior to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, use a model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischaemia</z:e> followed by reperfusion and report a significant <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi>-induced neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in some studies where the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> is permanently occluded, <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> pre-treatment in ovariectomized female rats has been shown to significantly exacerbate ischaemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore preclinical results demonstrate harmful as well as beneficial influences of <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> on the ischaemic brain, highlighting the need for further study to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for both detrimental and beneficial influences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ultimately, this could lead to the development of new classes of oestrogenic compounds with improved risk/benefit profiles, designed to selectively activate pathways inducing only the beneficial effects of <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> in vivo </plain></SENT>
