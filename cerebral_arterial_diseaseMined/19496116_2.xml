<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi>-Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease study investigators demonstrated that medically managed patients with symptomatic intracranial stenosis experience a 7-11% annual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early treatment efforts utilized balloon-mounted coronary stents, which provided excellent angiographic results (postprocedure stenoses &lt;10%), versus percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) alone (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> of balloon-mounted coronary stents provided limited access to the tortuous cerebrovasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Self-expanding stents became available for intracranial stenosis treatment in 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With increased flexibility, immediate results were encouraging (approximately 30% residual stenosis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, midterm results have demonstrated disappointingly high rates of restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To address these issues, the Pharos Neurovascular Stent System (Pharos, Micrus Endovascular, San Jose, CA) was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Pharos is a balloon-expandable stent mounted on a rapid-exchange <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> catheter especially designed for intracranial endovascular applications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Utilizing the Pharos, we obtained an outstanding angiographic result (0% residual stenosis), with no associated morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patient was discharged home on postprocedure day 1 and remained symptom-free, with no in-stent stenosis, 3 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our experience with the Pharos supports early literature suggesting that this stent may be a valuable treatment option for patients with medically refractory intracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
