<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> occlusions of the large intracranial arteries are relatively resistant to intravenous thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, multimodal approaches combining intravenous thrombolysis with endovascular mechanical recanalization are increasingly being applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this setting, intravenous thrombolysis may facilitate subsequent mechanical thrombectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the influence of intravenous thrombolysis on net intervention time in subsequent endovascular mechanical recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this retrospective single-center analysis, we compared net intervention time with and without preceding intravenous thrombolysis in patients treated by endovascular mechanical recanalization between 01/2003 and 06/2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The net intervention time was defined as the interval between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of endovascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> manipulation and successful vessel recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 65 eligible patients, 35 of whom were treated by intravenous thrombolysis before mechanical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was achieved in 26 patients with (74%) and 23 patients without preceding intravenous thrombolysis (77%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the case of successful recanalization, the net intervention time was significantly shorter in patients with preceding intravenous thrombolysis (24·8 ± 22·8 vs. 44·2 ± 40·5 min; P&lt;0·05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This difference remained significant after restricting the analysis to the patients treated by the Penumbra <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> System(©) (n=32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After three-months, patients with preceding intravenous thrombolysis were more likely to be functionally independent (modified Rankin Scale≤2) than those without (P&lt;0·05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that preceding intravenous thrombolysis may reduce the intervention time in patients treated by endovascular mechanical recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, due to the retrospective design of our study, these findings have to be interpreted with caution and need confirmation in a larger patient population </plain></SENT>
