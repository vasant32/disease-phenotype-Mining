<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Knowledge of the natural history of stenoses due to intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> may be useful for evaluating possible treatments such as angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records over a 7-year period to identify patients with intracranial atherosclerotic stenoses and serial angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quantitative measurements of stenoses were made in a blinded manner, and clinical outcomes were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 21 patients with 45 intracranial stenoses who underwent repeat angiography at an average interval of 26.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average stenosis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> intracranial lesions was 43.9% initially and 51.8% on follow-up (P=.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average stenosis in the intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) was stable (51.2% versus 52.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average stenosis in the anterior cerebral artery (ACA), middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), and posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) progressed from 32.4% to 49.7% (P=.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on a minimum 10% change, 20% of intracranial ICA lesions progressed compared with 61% of ACA, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regression occurred in 14% of the intracranial ICA group and 28% of the ACA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular events were infrequent during this period, with 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial atherosclerotic stenoses are dynamic lesions demonstrating both progression and regression </plain></SENT>
