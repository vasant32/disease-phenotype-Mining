<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether data obtained with the two methods are interchangeable and equally useful for clinical application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 20 infants at an age between 1 day and 2 1/2 months and a body weight between 1.2 and 3.4 kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cw Doppler measurements were performed using an Angiomatic (Medimatic) and pw measurements using a Mark 600 Duplex Scanner (ATL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We applied both methods within an interval as short as possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the data analysis the pulsatility index (PI) was used, a parameter fairly independent of the emission angle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PI was 0.66 +/- 0.06 (mean +/- SD) using the cw and 0.8 +/- 0.08 using the pw method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The linear correlation between the pulsatility indices obtained with the cw and the pw method respectively was statistically significant (r = 0.53, n = 20, p less than 0.0025), the variation around the regression line rather large </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The slope of the regression line differed significantly from that of the identity line (y = 0.391x + 0.54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore the PI values obtained with the two methods are not interchangable and require to be judged according to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both methods, however, yield PI values which correlate and can thus be equally used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The choice of the method rather depends on the goal to be achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The pw method seems to be more suitable for precise momentaneous descriptions and the cw method for continuous monitoring of cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
