<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In 36 patients with angiographically proven middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) stenosis, local cerebral hemodynamics were studied employing angiography, 133Xe inhalation regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measurements and CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> in 8 and completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients with less than 50% stenosis (n = 16) had no hemodynamic abnormality in angiographical and rCBF examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The infarction in this group was small and located in the basal ganglia area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients with 50 to 74% stenosis (n = 9) often revealed a delayed filling of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branches in the angiography, however, they showed no significant rCBF reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The infarction in this group was also small and located in the basal ganglia area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients with 75 to 99% stenosis (n = 11) exhibited a significant flow <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> both in angiographical and rCBF examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three of them had large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in the watershed zone or the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of the present study suggest that the hemodynamic effect of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis begins to manifest at 50% in grade and becomes apparent at 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The danger of hemodynamic crisis as well as the risk of large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> may increase when <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis exceeds 75% in grade </plain></SENT>
