<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A differential outcome results from rapid middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion in young normotensive Wistar (NW) rats as compared to the spontaneously hypertensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone (SHRSP) rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The SHRSP invariably <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>; the NW usually does not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine if segregation at a single autosomal locus explains the difference between strains, a NW male was crossed with several SHRSP females to produce F1 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The segregation of the strain difference was studied in the F2 and backcrosses to the NW and SHRSP parental strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relative frequency of infarcting and noninfarcting animals in the segregating progenies supported a single locus recessive model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> for susceptibility to infarction after sudden occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was largest for SHRSP and proportional to the SHRSP gene dosage in the segregating progenies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Variation in the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> within segregating classes may be attributable to the segregation of polygenes and/or environmental influences during the initial formation of the cerebral anastomoses </plain></SENT>
