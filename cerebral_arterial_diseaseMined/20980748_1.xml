<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine if intracranial atheroma was more common in lacunar than in cortical ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recruited patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and controls with mild cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, confirmed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype with magnetic resonance imaging and used transcranial Doppler ultrasound imaging to record flow velocity and focal stenoses in the basal intracranial arteries 1 month after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared ipsi- and contralateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> mean flow velocities between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes and tested for associations using linear mixed models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Amongst 67 lacunar and 67 mild cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, mean age 64 and 67 years, respectively, we found no difference in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> mean flow velocity between cortical and lacunar patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increasing age and white matter lesion scores were independently associated with lower <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> flow velocities (0.2 cms(-1) fall in velocity per year increase in age, p = 0.045; 3.75 cms(-1) fall in flow velocity per point increase in white matter lesion score, p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found no intracranial arterial stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> atheromatous stenosis is unlikely to be a common cause of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in white populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Falling velocities with increasing white matter lesion scores may reflect progressive brain tissue loss leaving less tissue to supply </plain></SENT>
