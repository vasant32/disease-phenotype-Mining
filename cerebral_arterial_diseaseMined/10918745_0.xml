<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three patients with middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) stenosis, three with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo>, two with vascular malformation, and one healthy volunteer were investigated by 3-D TCCS using a magnetic spatial positioning sensor mounted on the transducer for simultaneous recording of the probe coordinates to create a volumetric data set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional transcranial color-coded sonography enabled good visualization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, it failed to detect morphological details in vascular malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, 3-D TCCS is a promising technique that opens new perspectives in depicting intracranial vessels and provides volume measurement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
