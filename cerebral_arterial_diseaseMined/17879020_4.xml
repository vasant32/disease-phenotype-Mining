<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To detect coexistent CAS in CAD patients, we conducted a study of simultaneous coronary and cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 663 consecutive newly diagnosed CAD patients who had not yet been explored to have CAS, 80 were admitted to undergo angiography of bilateral carotid and vertebral system during the same procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We defined significant <z:mp ids='MP_0005412'>vascular stenosis</z:mp>, either located intracranially or extracranially, as the lesions of diameter stenosis more than 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Association between carotid or vertebral stenosis and their potential risk factors were also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of our patients, 18 (22.5%) had significant extracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0005412'>vascular stenosis</z:mp>, 14 (17.5%) suffered from intracranial stenosis, and 20 (25%) had both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 28 patients (35%) had no significant intracranial or extracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the demographic parameters as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> showed significant differences between the cerebral patent group and the CAS group, except for the number of coronary stenotic vessels (1.71 +/- 0.81 versus 2.69 +/- 0.64, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of coronary stenotic vessels is correlated well to the number of cerebral stenotic lesions (r = 0.562, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Besides, 8 of the cerebral stenotic patients and 2 of the cerebral patent patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude the CAS is coexistent in more than half of the CAD patients in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our study also implies a proportional increase in the severity of CAS to CAD severity </plain></SENT>
