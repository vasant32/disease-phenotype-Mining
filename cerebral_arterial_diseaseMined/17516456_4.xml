<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both patients present with left hemianopia, visual neglect and proprioceptive loss in addition to their alien limb symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lesion subtraction from seven control <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> patients revealed that medial parietal-occipital and thalamic areas were selectively damaged in the alien limb patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We propose that loss of the sense of motor intention and internal model of the current state of the arm, combined with deficient proprioceptive and visual feedback of the moving limb, are critical for genesis of posterior alien limb and discuss how affected regions normally function to ensure awareness of self-generated motor activity </plain></SENT>
