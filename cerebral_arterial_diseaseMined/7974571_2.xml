<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mortality has been declining in the United States for decades, recent trends in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence based on national data have not been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used Medicare hospitalization data to estimate national trends in the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> among Americans aged 70 years or older, and we provide evidence of the validity of the estimate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We defined <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as a principal diagnosis with International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification codes 430 to 434 or 436 to 437 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We excluded many recurrent cases from the analysis by eliminating persons hospitalized for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during the 5 years preceding the index <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We calculated annual adjusted incidence rates and examined trends graphically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of different exclusion periods, trends in in-hospital mortality of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, and trends in out-of-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We examined trends in relation to sex, race, and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The estimated age- and sex-adjusted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence declined 9.5% from 1985 to 1989, then increased 3.3% to 1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pattern did not vary with the length of the exclusion period or when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> listed diagnosis rather than principal diagnoses were used to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Incidence trends resembled the overall trend for both men and women, for 5-year age groups, and for whites; the trend did not change for blacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> incidence declined steadily from 1985 to 1989 and then increased slightly to 1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Several postulated potential sources of bias were investigated and found to be unlikely to account for the incidence decline, although some may have contributed to the subsequent incidence increase </plain></SENT>
