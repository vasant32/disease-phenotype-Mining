<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> increases flow velocities on the upslope of the Spencer's curve of cerebral hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the velocity can decrease with long and severely narrowed vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the frequency and accuracy for detection of focal and diffuse intracranial stenoses using novel diagnostic criteria that take into account increased resistance to flow with widespread lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated consecutive patients referred to a neurovascular ultrasound laboratory with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler mean flow velocities were classified as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (30 to 99 cm/s), high and low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pulsatility index &gt;or=1.2 was considered high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Focal intracranial disease was defined as &gt;or=50% diameter reduction by the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> Aspirin in Symptomatic Intracranial Disease criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diffuse disease was defined as stenoses in multiple intracranial arteries, multiple segments of one artery, or a long (&gt;1 cm) stenosis in one major artery on contrast angiography (CT angiography or digital subtraction angiography) as the gold standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred fifty-three patients (96 men, 76% white, age 62+/-15 years) had previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (n=135) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (n=18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler detection of focal and diffuse intracranial disease had sensitivity 79.4% (95% CI: 65.8% to 93%), specificity 92.4% (95% CI: 87.7% to 97.2%), positive predictive value 75.0% (95% CI: 60.9% to 89.2%), negative predictive value 94.0% (95% CI: 89.7% to 98.3%), and overall accuracy 89.5% (95% CI: 84.5% to 94.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors, transcranial Doppler findings of low mean flow velocities and high pulsatility index in a single vessel were independently associated with angiographically demonstrated diffuse single vessel intracranial disease, whereas low mean flow velocities/high pulsatility index in multiple vessels were related to multivessel intracranial disease (OR: 19.7, 95% CI: 4.8 to 81.2, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Diffuse intracranial disease may have a higher than expected frequency in a select <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> population and can be detected with noninvasive screening </plain></SENT>
