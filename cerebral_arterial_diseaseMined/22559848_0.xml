<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors present clinical and angiographic quantitative outcomes of indirect revascularization for patients with symptomatic intracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients treated for symptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> by indirect revascularization were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient population comprised those in whom medical management had failed and for whom endovascular therapy was unsuitable or had failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS) with or without bur holes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preoperative and postoperative angiograms were evaluated for change in caliber of extracranial blood vessels (superficial temporal artery [STA] and middle meningeal artery [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34840">MMA</z:chebi>]) and for evidence of neovascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen patients underwent EDAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ischemic symptoms ceased within the follow-up period in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, returning in a delayed fashion in only 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No other patients had recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> after the initial postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Donor blood vessels increased in size relative to preoperative sizes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 1 case (average increase of 52% for proximal STA [p=0.01], 74% for midpoint of STA [p=0.01], and 84% for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34840">MMA</z:chebi> [p=0.02]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, 8 of 11 patients demonstrated direct spontaneous anastomoses from extracranial to middle cerebral artery branches, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients demonstrated angiographic evidence of vascular blush and/or new branches from the STA and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34840">MMA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Indirect revascularization appears to be a safe and effective method to improve blood flow to ischemic brain due to intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Neovascularization and enlargement of the branches of the ECA were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and correlated with improvement in ischemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Indirect revascularization is an option for patients in whom medical therapy has failed and who are not suitable for endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
