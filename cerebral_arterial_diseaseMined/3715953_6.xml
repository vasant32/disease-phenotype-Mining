<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifteen male SHR, 10 weeks of age, were divided into control and experimental groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the experimental group, the animals were administered hydralazine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5557">guanethidine</z:chebi> for the following 10 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the age of 20 weeks, mean arterial blood pressure of experimental animals was 177 +/- 9 mm Hg (mean +/- SD), being significantly lower than that of 195 +/- 12 mm Hg in control ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Media thickness of large (external diameter greater than or equal to 200 micron) and medium sized <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (150-200 micron) in treated SHR was 12.3 +/- 2.8 and 6.3 +/- 1.1 micron, respectively, being significantly smaller than that of 14.0 +/- 2.2 and 8.5 +/- 2.6 micron, respectively, in control SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The media cross-sectional area and the ratio of media thickness to external diameter were also significantly reduced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the smaller vessels (75-150 micron), however, vascular morphometry revealed no difference between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Long-term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment during the early phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> attenuates the development of medial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> in large cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
