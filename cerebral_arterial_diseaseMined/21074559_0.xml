<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Swine models for cerebral arterial gas embolism have been used in the past </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, injection of air into the main artery feeding the pig brain - the ascending pharyngeal artery - might be complicated by the presence of the carotid rete, an arteriolar network at the base of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, anastomoses between external and internal carotid territories are present in the pig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to determine the most appropriate vessel for air injection, we performed experiments in which air was injected into either the ascending pharyngeal artery or the external carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We injected 0.25 ml/kg of room air selectively into the ascending pharyngeal artery or the external carotid artery of 35-40 kg Landrace pigs (n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We assessed the effect on cerebral metabolism by measuring intracranial pressure, brain oxygen tension and brain <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> concentrations using cerebral microdialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure and brain oxygen tension changed significantly in both groups, but did not differ between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> increased significantly more in pigs in which air was injected into the ascending pharyngeal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure, brain oxygen tension and brain <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> correlated after injection of air into the ascending pharyngeal artery, but not after injection into the external carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our model is suitable for investigation of cerebral arterial gas embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The ascending pharyngeal artery is the most appropriate vessel for air injection </plain></SENT>
