<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the CEST contrast is dependent upon experimental conditions-particularly, the radiofrequency (RF) irradiation scheme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although continuous-wave RF irradiation has been used conventionally, the limited RF pulse duration or duty cycle of most clinical systems requires the use of pulsed RF irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, the conventional numerical simulation is extended to describe pulsed-CEST MRI contrast as a function of RF pulse parameters (i.e., RF pulse duration and flip angle) and labile proton properties (i.e., exchange rate and chemical shift) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For diamagnetic CEST agents undergoing slow or intermediate chemical exchange, simulation shows a linear regression relationship between the optimal mean RF power of pulsed-CEST MRI and continuous-wave-CEST MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The optimized pulsed-CEST contrast is approximately equal to that of continuous-wave-CEST MRI for exchange rates less than 50 s(-1), as confirmed experimentally using a multicompartment pH phantom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> animals, we showed that pulsed- and continuous-wave-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">amide</z:chebi> proton CEST MRI demonstrated similar contrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, our study elucidated the RF irradiation dependence of pulsed-CEST MRI contrast, providing useful insights to guide its experimental optimization and quantification </plain></SENT>
