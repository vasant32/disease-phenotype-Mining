<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, 3 patients are described who developed symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> after surgery despite a widely patent anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In each patient, postoperative angiography revealed occlusion of a previously demonstrated high-grade stenosis of the intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Occlusion of the stenotic artery was probably related to decreased velocity of blood flow through the narrowed vessel resulting from alterations in flow patterns following anastomosis </plain></SENT>
