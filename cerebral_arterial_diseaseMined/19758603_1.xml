<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared data obtained from transcranial color-coded duplex sonography (TCCD) combined with carotid compression tests to morphometric autopsy data and to results given by a mathematical model of the cerebral macrocirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In 16 moribund patients, anterior and posterior communicating arteries of the circle of Willis were divided into functional and non-functional based on the results of the TCCD combined with carotid compression tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of the patients diameters and lengths of the main intracranial arteries were measured at autopsy and these values were treated with a mathematical model for calculating blood flow and blood pressure in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the segments of the arterial network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diameters and the blood flows through the communicating arteries were found to be significantly higher in the group of functional arteries than in that of non-functional ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, blood flow was also shown to be dependent on other parameters such as the pressure difference between the two ends of the vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that functional ability of the Willisian collaterals depends on morphological and functional parameters, and is therefore better assessed by a functional method, such as TCCD, than by a solely morphological one, such as cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mathematically based circulation modeling, when it will be possible, could be a more comprehensive tool for delineating patients at a higher risk for hemodynamic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0241832" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular insufficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
