<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study, which was not a randomized controlled trial but a case cohort study with historical control, was to determine whether pretreatment with a novel free radical scavenger, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi>, could prevent occurrence of cerebral hyperperfusion after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty patients with ipsilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (&gt;/=70%) underwent CEA with administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> before internal carotid artery clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preoperative cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> were assessed with single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow also was measured immediately after CEA and on the 3rd postoperative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cerebral hyperperfusion (cerebral blood flow increase &gt;/=100% compared with preoperative values) was revealed by SPECT performed immediately after CEA in only one patient (2%), who also exhibited reduced preoperative CVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of post-CEA hyperperfusion as revealed by SPECT in the control group (51 CEA patients without administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi>) was significantly higher (16%) (P = 0.0310, control versus treatment group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, in a subgroup of patients with reduced preoperative CVR, the incidence of post-CEA hyperperfusion as revealed by SPECT in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> group (7%) was significantly lower than that in the control group (67%) (P = 0.0029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that reduced preoperative CVR and absence of pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> were significant independent predictors of post-CEA hyperperfusion as revealed by SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> can prevent occurrence of cerebral hyperperfusion after CEA </plain></SENT>
