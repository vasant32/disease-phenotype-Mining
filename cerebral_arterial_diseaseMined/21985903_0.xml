<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Identification and rating of CMBs on MRI images may be facilitated by semi-automatic detection, particularly on high-resolution images acquired at high field strength </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For these images, visual rating is time-consuming and has limited reproducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present the radial symmetry transform (RST) as an efficient method for semi-automated CMB detection on 7.0 T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images, with a high sensitivity and a low number of false positives that have to be censored manually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The RST was computed on both echoes of a dual-echo T2*-weighted gradient echo 7.0 T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> sequence in 18 participants from the Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease (SMART) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Potential CMBs were identified by combining the output of the transform on both echoes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each potential CMB identified through the RST was visually checked by two raters to identify probable CMBs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The scoring time needed to manually reject false positives was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of 71.2% is higher than that of individual human raters on 7.0 T scans and the required human rater time is reduced from 30 to 2 minutes per scan on average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The RST outperforms published semi-automated methods in terms of either a higher sensitivity or less false positives, and requires much less human rater time </plain></SENT>
