<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the prevalence and distribution of subcortical lacunar lesions (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLLs</z:e>) in patients with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> with subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> (CADASIL), to determine whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLLs</z:e> are an abnormal finding by studying their prevalence in healthy subjects, and to assess whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLLs</z:e> occur in other conditions associated with small vessel disease and white matter areas of high signal intensity (WMH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLLs</z:e>, their location, and their relation to other abnormalities were assessed on magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) images (T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery) obtained in 34 CADASIL patients and 20 healthy family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three additional control groups of healthy volunteers, elderly patients with vascular risk factors, and patients with another hereditary small vessel disease were also screened for the presence and location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity of the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLLs</z:e> for the diagnosis of CADASIL were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLLs</z:e> were found in 20 (59%) of CADASIL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLLs</z:e> increased with age (20%, &lt;30 years; 50%, 30-50 years; 80%, &gt;50 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLLs</z:e> invariably occurred in the anterior temporal lobes and in areas where diffuse WMH expanded into arcuate fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From the anterior temporal lobe, the lesions could extend dorsally into the temporal lobes and rostrally into the frontal lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lesions were not found in the parietal and occipital lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the control subjects had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Specificity and sensitivity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLLs</z:e> for CADASIL were 100% and 59%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLLs</z:e> are an abnormal finding at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging that frequently occur in CADASIL patients </plain></SENT>
