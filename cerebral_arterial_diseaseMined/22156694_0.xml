<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The implementation of uniform nomenclature and classification in adult arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (AIS) has been critical for defining outcomes and recurrence risks according to etiology and in developing risk-stratified treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, current classification and nomenclature in childhood AIS are often overlapping or contradictory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to develop a comprehensive consensus-based classification system for childhood AIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using a modified-Delphi method, members of the International Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Study (IPSS) developed the Childhood AIS Standardized Classification And Diagnostic Evaluation (CASCADE) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two groups of pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> specialists from the IPSS classified 7 test cases using 2 methods each: (1) classification typical of the individual clinician's current clinical practice; and (2) classification based on the CASCADE criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group 1 underwent in-person training in the utilization of the CASCADE criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group 2 classified the same cases via an online survey, including definitions but without training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inter-rater reliability (IRR) was assessed via multi-rater unweighted κ-statistic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In Group 1 (with training), IRR was improved using CASCADE criteria (κ=0.78, 95% CI=[0.49, 0.94]), compared with typical clinical practice (κ=0.40, 95% CI=[0.11, 0.60]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In Group 2 (without training), IRR was lower than among trained raters (��=0.61, 95% CI=[0.29, 0.77]), but higher than current practice (κ=0.23, 95% CI=[0.03, 0.36]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A new, consensus-based classification system for childhood AIS, the CASCADE criteria, can be used to classify cases with good IRR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These preliminary findings suggest that the CASCADE criteria may be particularity useful in the setting of prospective multicenter studies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011463'>childhood-onset</z:hpo> AIS, where standardized training of investigators is feasible </plain></SENT>
