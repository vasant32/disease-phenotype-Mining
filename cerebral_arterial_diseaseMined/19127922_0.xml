<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: to investigate the influence of acupuncture parameter on acupuncture effect and to probe the optimum stimulation parameter for Shuigou (GV 26) in Xingnao Kaiqiao needling method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The rat model of middle cerebral artery obstruction (MCAO) was replicated and "Shuigou" (GV 26) was stimulated by 9 acupuncture parameters combined by two factors at 3 levels, i. e. frequency 1, 2, 3 times/second, and needling duration 5 s, 60 s, 180 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of acupuncture at "Shuigou" (GV 26) with the 9 different acupuncture parameters on cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the MCAO rat were investigated by orthogonal test, factor analysis and one-way ANOVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Acupuncture effect was influenced by acupuncture frequency, acupuncture duration and their combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among them, the acupuncture duration was the most important factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The best acupuncture effect could be attained by using as long acupuncture duration as possibly with the fastest acupuncture frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the Xingnao Kaiqiao needling method, acupuncture at "Shuigou" (GV 26) with fastest frequency and enough long duration can get the best acupuncture effect, which are the optimum stimulation parameters for "Shuigou" (GV 26) </plain></SENT>
