<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Severe stenosis of the right internal carotid artery and occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) were revealed by cerebral angiography, and a hypoperfused area in left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory and crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) on I-123 IMP SPECT was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, IMZ SPECT showed symmetric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the carotid endoarterectomy, the hypoperfused area in left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory on <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> SPECT and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> had improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is thought that IMZ SPECT can be a useful tool for the prediction of improvement of cerebral perfusion and the clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
