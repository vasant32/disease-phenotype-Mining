<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The angle of insonation cannot be assessed with conventional transcranial Doppler sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Findings in healthy control subjects suggest that the angle is relatively small in routine clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data regarding the angle in middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) stenosis are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, the angle and its effect on flow velocity measurements were assessed with transcranial color Doppler sonography in patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen patients (median age, 53 y; age range, 22-72 y) who satisfied qualifying criteria (eg, angiographically revealed unilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis of &gt; or =50%) were selected from 149 consecutive patients enrolled in a prospective study of transcranial color Doppler sonography and cerebral digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had active neurologic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The angle of insonation and peak systolic and mean flow velocities in both <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> were measured from videotapes generated at sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean angle of insonation was 47 +/- 11 degrees (range, 19-64 degrees ) on the stenotic side and 34 +/- 18 degrees on the contralateral side (P &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Angle-corrected velocities were higher than uncorrected ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Differences between angle-corrected and uncorrected peak systolic and mean flow velocities on the stenotic side were 46.6% and 45.9%, respectively, of uncorrected values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Differences between corrected and uncorrected peak systolic and mean velocities were larger on the stenotic side compared with those on the contralateral side (P &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with moderate or severe <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis, the angle of insonation can be substantial and cause large errors when flow velocities are measured without angle correction </plain></SENT>
