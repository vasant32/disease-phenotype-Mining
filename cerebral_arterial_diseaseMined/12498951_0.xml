<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 15 patients with insufficient Doppler signal due to inadequate transtemporal acoustic bone window were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Signal from the middle cerebral artery was recorded during the IV infusion of Levovist (300 mg/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increment of signal enhancement in dB, time to signal enhancement appearance, time to clinically useful signal enhancement appearance, and duration of clinically useful signal enhancement were assessed during two infusions at the rate of 1 and 0.66 mL/min, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increment of signal enhancement was similar at the rate of 1 and 0.66 mL/min (p = 0.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean time to signal enhancement appearance and mean time to clinically useful signal enhancement appearance were not significantly different with the two rates of infusion (p = 0.9 and p = 0.3, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of clinically useful signal enhancement was significantly higher with the infusion rate of 0.66 mL/min as compared to 1 mL/min (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Levovist injected at the infusion rate of 0.66 mL/min prolonged the mean duration of signal enhancement, maintaining its effectiveness </plain></SENT>
