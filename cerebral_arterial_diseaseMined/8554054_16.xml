<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A genetic linkage analysis conducted in two large families recently allowed us to map the affected gene on chromosome 19 in a 12-cM interval bracketed by D19S221 and D19S215 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, these first 2 families and 13 additional ones, including a total of 199 potentially informative meiosis, have been genotyped with eight polymorphic markers located between D19S221 and D19S215 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> families were linked to chromosome 19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The highest combined lod score (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2955">Zmax</z:chebi> = 37.24 at theta = .01) was obtained with marker D19S841, a new CAn microsatellite marker that we isolated from chromosome 19 cosmids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The recombinant events observed within these families were used to refine the genetic mapping of CADASIL within a 2-cM interval that is now bracketed by D19S226 and D19S199 on 19p13.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data strongly suggest the genetic homogeneity of this recently identified condition and establish the value of its clinical and neuroimaging diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Besides their importance for the ongoing positional cloning of the CADASIL gene, these data help to refine the genetic mapping of CADASIL relative to familial hemiplegic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> and hereditary paroxysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo>, conditions that we both mapped within the same chromosome 19 region </plain></SENT>
