<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The practical interest in such pathology concerns: the risk of a fall in blood pressure during general anesthesia which may result in occlusion of a narrowed artery; the need to estimate the pathological state of one or several arteries passing by a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> which must be removed; and the possibility of providing an extra-intracranial arterial bypass if necessary </plain></SENT>
