<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine whether a decrease in the BZRs in the non-infarcted cerebral cortex is associated with poor performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), which assesses executive functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors measured the BZRs using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography and (11)C-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5103">flumazenil</z:chebi> in 60 non-disabled patients with unilateral atherosclerotic ICA or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease and no cortical infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using three-dimensional stereotactic surface projections, the abnormally decreased BZR index (extent (%) of pixels with Z score &gt;2 compared with controls Ã— average Z score in those pixels) in the cerebral cortex of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory was calculated and found to be correlated with the patient's score on the WCST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On the basis of the WCST results, 39 patients were considered abnormal (low categories achieved) for their age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The BZR index of the ACA territory in the hemisphere affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> was significantly higher in abnormal patients than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The BZR index of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory differed significantly between the two groups when patients with left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> (n=28) were analysed separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In atherosclerotic ICA or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease, selective neuronal damage that is manifested as a decrease in BZRs in the non-infarcted cerebral cortex may contribute to the development of executive dysfunction </plain></SENT>
