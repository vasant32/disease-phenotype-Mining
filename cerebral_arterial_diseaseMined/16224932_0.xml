<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety of adjuvant intravenous use of abciximab in balloon angioplasty for symptomatic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seven patients with symptomatic stenosis at the main trunk (n=5), or proximal post-trifurcation portion (n=2) of the middle cerebral artery, were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A bolus dose of abciximab (0.15 mg/kg) was given intravenously immediately before the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The immediate morphologic results as well as the presence of hyperacute <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> after angioplasty were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical evaluation was performed 1 day and 1 month following angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Oral antiplatelets were administered during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up angiography was performed after 7 to 14 (mean 10.4) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stenosis of a vessel greater than 50% was considered as restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The procedure was technically successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immediate residual stenosis was insignificant in 4 and mild (less than 50%) in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1708549" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intimal dissection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mild gum <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was noted in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> study patients were clinically stable at follow-up without newly developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurological abnormality</z:hpo> even though there was one case of occlusion and one case of restenosis on follow-up angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Angiographic patency rate was 71% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In performing proximal middle cerebral artery balloon angioplasty, abciximab may be safely used to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The mid-term patency of the vessels was also acceptable </plain></SENT>
