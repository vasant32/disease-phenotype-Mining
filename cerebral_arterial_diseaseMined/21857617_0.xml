<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a descriptive, analytic, follow up study we prospectively studied 201 patients undergoing elective and isolated CABG surgery during a 12 month period from October 2003 to September 2004 at Madani Hospital of Tabriz Medical Sciences University, Iran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurologic examination, intracranial cerebral arterial study using transcranial Doppler (TCD) and carotid duplex were performed preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative and postoperative complications were followed up for one month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred and one patients (158 male, 43 female) with a mean age of 57.29+/-9.67 were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Out of these, 131 patients had 3 coronary vessels disease, 64 had 2 vessels, 5 had one vessel, and one patient had diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A TCD was performed in 183 patients and disclosed abnormalities in 22 patients and was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 161 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The total number of involved arteries was 34 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among 154 carotid duplex studied patients, 102 had plaque, inducing &lt;50% stenosis in 99, 50-74% stenosis in one, and 75-90% stenosis in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative neurologic complication occurred as follows: 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 7 delirium, and 3 amnesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One of the operated patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nine of 161 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> TCD (5.6%) and 5 of 22 (22.7%) with intracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial disease</z:e> (ICAD) showed central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) complications (p=0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were significant correlations between number of involved cerebral arteries and post CABG <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> complications (p=0.0001), including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (p=0.007), and between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> history with these complications (p=0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that lCAD is an independent risk factor for <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> complications after CABG surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Hence, we recommend pre-CABG evaluation of the cerebral arteries by TCD, for the risk assessment of CABG surgery </plain></SENT>
