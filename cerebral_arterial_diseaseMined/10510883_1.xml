<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preoperative low perfusion areas detected by cerebral blood flow SPECT (CBF-SPECT) were divided into two parts on BZR-SPECT images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the low perfusion areas where the BZR were preserved, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) increased on postoperative CBF-SPECT, but where the BZR were not preserved, rCBF did not increase on postoperative CBF-SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On visual inspection, the SPECT images of postoperative CBF-SPECT appeared similar to those of preoperative BZR-SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For evaluation of the ischemic brain condition itself, instead of the cerebral metabolism, the distribution and activity of cerebral neurons indicated by BZR-SPECT with IMZ might be utilized </plain></SENT>
