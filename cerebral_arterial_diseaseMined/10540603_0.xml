<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 4-D imaging, electrocardiography-triggered data acquisition of consecutive phases during the heart cycle are stored to form a multiphase 3-D data set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The option of color-coded data gives a new insight into such hemodynamic information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the past, 3-D reconstructions were simple unicolor images, as in power mode, and the color-coded hemodynamic information was lost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These new options are presented here, along with color-coded data in examples of angiographically controlled pathologic results in extracranial and intracranial vessels </plain></SENT>
