<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Inflammatory stenoses of cerebral arteries cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with florid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, diagnosis is often difficult even with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to establish the value of contrast-enhanced MRI, proven to be sensitive to extradural <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo>, for the identification of intracranial vessel wall <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005318'>cerebral vasculitis</z:hpo> affecting large brain vessels were retrieved from the files: 8 children (2-10 years, 7 female, 1 male) and 19 adults (16-76 years, 10 female, 9 male) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was based on histological or serological proof of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> or on clinical and imaging criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> MRI examinations included diffusion-weighted imaging, time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (TOF-MRA) and contrast-enhanced scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRI scans were assessed for the presence of ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e>, arterial stenoses, vessel wall thickening and contrast uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ischemic changes of the brain tissue were seen in 24/27 patients and restricted diffusion suggestive of recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in 17/27; 25/27 patients had uni- or multifocal stenoses of intracranial arteries on TOF-MRA and 5/6 had stenoses on DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vessel wall thickening was identified in 25/27, wall enhancement in 23/27 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Wall thickening and intramural contrast uptake are frequent findings in patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0005318'>cerebral vasculitis</z:hpo> affecting large brain arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further prospective studies are required to determine the specificity of this finding </plain></SENT>
