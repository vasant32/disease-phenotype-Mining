<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> occlusive lesions of the intracranial major arteries seen in conventional angiograms were revealed clearly with MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However MRA had its practical limitation in the evaluation of the leptomeningeal anastomosis (collateral circulation) probably due to the deterioration of contrast in its slow flow and saturation effect of the magnetization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to that, MRA often exaggerated the severity of the stenotic lesions, mostly in severe cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The post-operative state of collateral flow and the patency of EC/IC bypass could be evaluated as properly with MRA as with conventional angiography, although MRA was limited in spatial resolution and evaluation of flow direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, MRA was considered t be a reliable non-invasive modality as a screening examination for the evaluation of the carotid occlusive disease and as the follow-up study of the post-operative patients with EC/IC bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
