<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic value of a new 1-MHz probe for TCD was compared with a standard 2-MHz probe in patients with an insufficient ultrasonic window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From a total population of 514 consecutive patients, the study involved only patients in whom a bad or absent temporal bone window was revealed during 2-MHz TCD examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients (39 women and 11 men) with a mean age of 71 +/- 9 y were investigated with a 2-MHz probe and subsequently with a 1-MHz probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using the 2-MHz probe, 18 patients (group I) lacked a temporal insonation window bilaterally, while 12 had an absent bone window unilaterally (group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (group III) had bilateral bone windows, but with insufficient detection of the anterior and posterior cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In four of the 18 patients in group I (22%), the circle of Willis could be demonstrated with the 1-MHz probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 11 of the 12 patients in group II (92%), it was possible to demonstrate the contralateral vessels through the ipsilateral bone window with the 1-MHz probe, while this was only possible in 25% with the 2-MHz probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 20 patients of group III could be successfully examined with the 1-MHz probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 1-MHz probe provides an opportunity to perform TCD studies in older patients presenting with absent or insufficient temporal bone windows for examination with 2-MHz probes </plain></SENT>
