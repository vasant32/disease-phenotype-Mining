<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated that distal branches of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) are joined by interarterial anastomoses to rami of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Wistar rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Arteries of 36- and 56-day-old animals were dilated with papaverine and injected with Vultex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vultex arrived at corresponding ACA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> collaterals simultaneously as determined by microscopy through a skull window and photography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were about 29 ACA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> junctions per hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Junction density was nearly constant along the frontal-occipital axis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The anastomoses were most numerous between 2 and 3 mm lateral to the midline and were less than 120 micron in internal diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found between total numbers of junctions for right versus left hemispheres or between age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most evident collateral pattern was characterized by two ACA end rami joining two <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> end branches to form a closed, diamond-shaped collateral unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Considerations were given to alternate routes of blood flow into the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> tissue field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude abundant dorsal anastomoses exist in 36- and 56-day-old rats and are the prime potential source for ACA collateral supply to the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> tissue field </plain></SENT>
