<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As for a variety of signs and symptoms presented, alien hand syndrome (AHS) can be easily overlooked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: In this report, we present a patient with a mixed types of AHS coexistence secondary to the corpus callosum infarction, including a motor type of AHS by intermanual conflict (callosal type AHS) and a sensory type of AHS by alien hand and left hemianesthesia (posterior AHS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our case may contribute to the early recognition of AHS and to explore the abnormal neural mechanism of AHS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, rare reports have ever documented such mixed AHS coexisting secondary to the callosal lesion, based on advanced neuroimaging methods as in our case </plain></SENT>
