<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Many anomalies and variants in vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> have been reported in relation to the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We encountered an apparently novel anomaly in a 30-year-old man admitted for disturbance of consciousness following a traffic accident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography revealed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: No <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> related to the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> were detected by conventional angiography, so we concluded that the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was of traumatic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anomalous origin of the ACA was disclosed incidentally, with both A1 segments arising from the right internal carotid artery; no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> A1 segment of the left ACA was visualized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We discuss possible bases for this anomalous origin </plain></SENT>
