<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The latter consisted of vasospasm, vasodilatation, and organic stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A marked change in the caliber of the cerebral arteries was demonstrated 3 times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm, the stimulus phenomenon, was produced by the surrounding purulent material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vasodilatation, the paralytic phenomenon, was presumably due to decreased contractile energy in association with myonecrosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Organic stenosis, the repair process, was due to the organization of subendothelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> with resultant intimal thickening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evidence of increased endothelial permeability, subendothelial proliferation of smooth muscle cells, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of the latter in the media is presented in both light and electron micrographs </plain></SENT>
