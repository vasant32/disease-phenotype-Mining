<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the accuracy of three-dimensional, Fourier transform, time-of-flight magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) angiography in the detection of intracranial steno-occlusive diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred thirty-one patients (62 male and 69 female patients, aged 6-77 years [mean, 53 years 8 months]) underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and conventional angiography for evaluation of possible intracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 502 arteries were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight projections and a collapsed image postprocessed by means of a maximum-intensity projection algorithm were reviewed by five observers in a blinded manner, with conventional angiography as the standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 32 steno-occlusive lesions were available for review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic analysis from the pooled data revealed overall sensitivities of 85% and 88% and specificities of 96% and 97% for the internal carotid artery and the middle cerebral artery, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography is useful as the primary diagnostic tool for evaluating suspected intracranial steno-occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
