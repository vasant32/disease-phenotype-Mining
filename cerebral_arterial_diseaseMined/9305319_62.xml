<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In administrative databases the International Classification of Diseases, Version 9, Clinical Modification (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9-CM) is often used to identify patients with specific diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, certain conditions may not be accurately reflected by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 codes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the accuracy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 coding for cerebrovascular disease by comparing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 codes in an administrative database with clinical findings ascertained from medical record abstractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We selected patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 diagnostic codes of 433 through 436 (in either the primary or secondary positions) from an administrative database of patients hospitalized in five academic medical centers in 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Medical records of the selected patients were reviewed by trained medical abstractors, and the patients' clinical conditions during the admission (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, asymptomatic) were recorded, as well as any history of cerebrovascular symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results of the medical record review were compared with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 codes from the administrative database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More than 85% of those patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 code 433 were asymptomatic for the index admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More than one-third of these asymptomatic patients did not undergo either cerebral angiography or carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 code 434, 85% of patients were classified as having a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 code 435, 77% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For code 436, 77% of patients were classified as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Limiting the identifying <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 code to the primary position increased the likelihood of agreement with the medical record review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 coding scheme may be inaccurate in the classification of patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Its limitations must be recognized in the analyses of administrative databases selected by using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 codes 433 through 436 </plain></SENT>
