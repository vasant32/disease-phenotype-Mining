<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that when these patients used the hand contralateral to the hypoperfused hemisphere they would show unique activation in motor-related areas of the normally perfused hemisphere, that is, ipsilateral activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> performance of two motor tasks was associated with increased ipsilateral hemispheric activation in the patients compared with age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, although task difficulty had an effect on ipsilateral activation, the increased ipsilateral activation seen in patients was not dependent on task difficulty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrate that hemodynamic compromise alone is sufficient to cause atypical ipsilateral activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This activation may serve to maintain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> motor performance </plain></SENT>
