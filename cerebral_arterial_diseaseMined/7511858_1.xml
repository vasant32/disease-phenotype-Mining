<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The parasystolic rhythm causes changes of systemic arterial blood pressure, which are comparable to the hemodynamic effects of frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because a reduction of cerebral blood flow induced by frequent premature ventricular beats can be assumed by the results of the laboratory investigations, cerebral blood flow was determined in a clinical study in 19 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> patients and in 11 healthy, age-adjusted volunteers using the 133Xenon-inhalation method, in order to investigate the effect of ventricular ectopics on cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously Holter monitoring was performed during cerebral blood flow measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was estimated by the initial slope index, which is calculated from the early decay of the clearance curve, and by the mean cerebral blood flow index, which is calculated by the stochastic method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Grey matter blood flow is estimated by the two-compartment analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> patients is reduced versus controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The initial slope indices were 45.2 +/- 5.1 s-1 and 57.4 +/- 7.2(-1), respectively (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with frequent ventricular ectopic activity (739/h) an additional reduction of cerebral blood flow was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The initial slope index was 42.6 +/- 6.3 s-1 (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The reduction of cerebral blood flow in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> patients is partially due to the coincidence of coronary and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Frequent <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular premature contractions</z:mp> might cause an additional reduction </plain></SENT>
