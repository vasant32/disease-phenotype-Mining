<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, since the AIF is commonly measured in a major artery, there can be perfusion measurement errors associated with bolus delay/dispersion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although methods to account for delay-related errors have been proposed, the effect of dispersion is more difficult to deal with and is usually left uncorrected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study presents an assessment of the delay-dispersion relationship in a group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although a significant correlation was observed with one of the bolus delay definitions used, the estimation of the dispersion from the degree of delay was unreliable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the dispersion observed in many patients was sufficient to result in substantial perfusion errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results are compared with previous numerical simulations, and their implications for the assessment and management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are discussed </plain></SENT>
