<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis is made by proof of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath> in the vessel wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A case of recurrent and multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> after head injury is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 74-year-old female was referred to our hospital because of head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CT scan showed traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and intraventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Her consciousness was clear but slight <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo> was recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conservative therapy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the course subcortical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> occurred five times and during the second one, right frontal and right parietal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> occurred simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Her consciousness deteriorated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The second subcortical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was especially complicated by a ventriculoperitoneal shunt operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A biopsy of the cortex was performed and pathological examination revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath> in the walls of small pial and cortical vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Occasional duplicated wall, obliterative intimal proliferation and disappearance of elastic lamina were recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The patient sank into a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917808" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vegetative state</z:e> due to recurrent and multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CAA results in two possibilities, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and ischemic cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>When lobar or subcortical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> is encountered in a normotensive elderly patient, the possibility of a CAA-related <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> should be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The author carefully emphasizes that there is indication for neurosurgical treatment in CAA patients and proposes that therapy for ischemic cerebrovascular disease should be given special attention </plain></SENT>
