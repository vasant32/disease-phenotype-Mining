<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have examined the incidence and size of infarction after occlusion of different portions of the rat middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) in order to define the reliability and predictability of this model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We developed a neurologic examination and have correlated changes in neurologic status with the size and location of areas of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was surgically occluded at different sites in six groups of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 24 hr, rats were evaluated for the extent of neurologic deficits and graded as having severe, moderate, or no deficit using a new examination developed for this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After rats were sacrificed the incidence of infarction was determined at histologic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a subset of rats, the size of the area of infarction was measured as a percent of the area of a standard coronal section </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Focal (1-2 mm) occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> at its origin, at the olfactory tract, or lateral to the inferior cerebral vein produced infarction in 13%, 67%, and 0% of rats, respectively (N = 38) and produced variable neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, more extensive (3 or 6 mm) occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> beginning proximal to the olfactory tract--thus isolating lenticulostriate end-arteries from the proximal and distal supply--produced infarctions of uniform size, location, and with severe neurologic deficit (Grade 2) in 100% of rats (N = 17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurologic deficit correlated significantly with the size of the infarcted area (Grade 2, N = 17, 28 +/- 5% infarction; Grade 1, N = 5, 19 +/- 5%; Grade 0, N = 3, 10 +/- 2%; p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We have characterized precise anatomical sites of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> that when surgically occluded reliably produce uniform <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in rats, and have developed a neurologic grading system that can be used to evaluate the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> rapidly and accurately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The model will be useful for experimental assessment of new therapies for irreversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
