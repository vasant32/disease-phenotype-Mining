<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography literature, markedly hypometabolic brain tissue (oxygen metabolism &lt; 1.3 to 1.7 mL.100 g-1.min-1) has often been equated with irreversible damage in the human brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By serial <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography measurements, we investigated the temporal evolution of the volume of severely hypometabolic brain tissue after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in anesthetized baboons with, as a perspective, the development of rational therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven anesthetized and ventilated baboons underwent sequential <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography examinations with the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="36932">15O</z:chebi> steady-state technique before and 1, 4, 7, and 24 hours and 14 to 29 days after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each baboon the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was calculated by quantitative histological procedures after 19 to 41 days of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sequential measurement of regional oxygen metabolism demonstrated an extension (for &gt; or = 24 hours) of the volume of severely hypometabolic tissue as defined by both absolute and relative metabolic thresholds, and this profile of evolutivity is observed no matter the threshold used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean (+/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) infarction volume of 2.4 +/- 0.6 cm3 was comparable to a tissue volume with oxygen consumption &lt; 40% of contralateral metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The volume of hypometabolic tissue was essentially stable at the 1-, 4-, and 7-hour postocclusion studies, increased markedly at the 24-hour study point, and increased even further in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>-stage study (on average, 17 days after occlusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The tissue that eventually displayed a severely hypometabolic state at the final measurement showed a significant decrease of oxygen metabolism and cerebral blood flow at each time analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In that tissue, the oxygen extraction fraction increased significantly at 1 hour (although not thereafter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The extension of severely hypometabolic volume after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> reinforces the concept of a dynamic penumbra and suggests the existence of a relatively large window of therapeutic opportunity in which it may be possible to develop neuroprotective strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that maximum <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume is determined at some time between 24 hours and 17 days after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in anesthetized baboons </plain></SENT>
