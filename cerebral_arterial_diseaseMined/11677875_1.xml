<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors prospectively identified 120 consecutive patients admitted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and performed both TCCS and MRA with a mean interval of 1 day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TCCS data (sampling depth, peak systolic and end diastolic angle-corrected velocity, mean angle-corrected velocity, and pulsatility index) for middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi>) were compared to MRA data and classified into 4 grades: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (grade 1): <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> caliber and signal; mild stenosis (grade 2): irregular lumen with reduced signal; severe stenosis (grade 3): absent signal in the stenotic segment (flow gap) and reconstituted distal signal; and possible occlusion (grade 4): absent signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cutoffs were chosen to maximize diagnostic accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Interobserver agreement for MRA grading resulted in a weighted-kappa value of 0.776 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of poor temporal window was 37% (89/240) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Doppler signals were obtained in 135 vessels, and the angle-corrected velocities (peak systolic, end diastolic, mean) were significantly different (P = .001, P = .006, and P &lt; .001) among the MRA grades: grade 1 (100, 47, 68 cm/s), grade 2 (171, 72, 110 cm/s), grade 3 (226, 79, 134 cm/s), grade 4 (61, 26, 39 cm/s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, an angle-corrected <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> peak systolic velocity &gt; or = 120 cm/s correlates with intracranial stenosis on MRA (grade 2 or worse) with high specificity (90.5%; 95% confidence interval = 78.5%-96.8%) and positive predictive value (93.9%) but relatively low sensitivity (66.7%; 95% confidence interval = 61.2%-69.5%) and negative predictive value (55.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Elevated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> velocities on TCCS correlate with intracranial stenosis detected on MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An angle-corrected peak systolic velocity &gt; or = 120 cm/s is highly specific for detecting intracranial stenosis as defined by significant MRA abnormality </plain></SENT>
