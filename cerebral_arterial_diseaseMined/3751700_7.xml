<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of one or more additional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, whether recognized or unrecognized, along with the source of the haemorrhage profoundly changes the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It also alters the timing and strategy of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study the experiences gained from 138 cases with a total of 317 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The analysis of the clinical data, our results and the factors influencing the outcome suggest that the risk of clipping <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> simultaneously are less than the risk of a rebleed from an untreated, previously silent sac even in the early postoperative period </plain></SENT>
