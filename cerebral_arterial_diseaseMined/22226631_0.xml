<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0010138'>arterial inflammation</z:mp> in subjects with recent ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and controls with prior cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0010138'>arterial inflammation</z:mp> was prospectively measured by (18)F-fluorodeoxygluose <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography in 11 cases with recent ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, and 11 sex matched controls with prior cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hot spots (both carotid and non-carotid) of localised (18)FDG uptake were found in more than half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with either recent (n = 6) or prior (n = 8) cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the total number of hotspots, or hotspots at specific sites, in cases compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean standard uptake values (SUV) were similar in the carotid arteries and aorta of cases and controls, and showed a trend toward higher values in the femoral arteries of the controls (median 1.8; IQR 1.6-2.2) compared to cases (median 1.5; IQR 1.4-1.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:mp ids='MP_0010138'>Arterial inflammation</z:mp> was common, and appeared similar, in patients with recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, and controls with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> more than two years previously </plain></SENT>
