<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present morphological findings in a further German family affected by CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The index case showed the typical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi>-Schiff-positive granular degeneration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in cerebral vessels, which did not react with antibodies against various immunoglobulins or complement factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructurally, granular osmiophilic material (GOM) covered the VSMC in different cerebral regions as well as in extracerebral organs (muscle, nerve, skin, small and large intestine, liver, kidney and heart) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Skin biopsy samples from other family members of the last two generations also revealed GOM irrespective of the clinical symptomatology (CADASIL, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> only or asymptomatic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in the third generation had higher amounts of GOM in skin vessels than did asymptomatic or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> patients in the fourth generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that skin biopsy is a useful and less invasive screening method for the differential diagnosis of CADASIL </plain></SENT>
