<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler studies showed an increased mean flow velocity at rest (p less than 0.05) in the middle cerebral artery on the side of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and a decreased vasomotor response to CO 2 (p less than 0.001) on the same side compared to control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biomagnetic measurements of somatosensory evoked fields of 11 patients and 11 control subjects in this study did not demonstrate differences between migraineurs and the control group in current flow or latency measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data from this study tend to support the hypothesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> as a primary underlying deficit in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
