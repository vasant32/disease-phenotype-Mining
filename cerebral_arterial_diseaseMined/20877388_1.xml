<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the association of decreases in cortical BZRs with hemodynamic compromise and the effect of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) on these receptors in patients whose atherosclerotic ICA or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease is asymptomatic, we measured BZRs using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography and (11)C-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5103">flumazenil</z:chebi> in 79 patients with asymptomatic atherosclerotic ICA or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease and no cortical infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional stereotactic surface projections were used to calculate the BZR index, a measure of abnormally decreased BZRs in the cerebral cortex within the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis showed this index to be positively correlated with the value of oxygen extraction fraction, with the presence of silent subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and with the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, whereas it was negatively correlated with the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> with ARBs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In asymptomatic atherosclerotic ICA or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease, hemodynamic compromise is associated with selective neuronal damage manifested as decreases in cortical BZRs in the noninfarcted cerebral cortex, whereas ARBs are associated with preservation of cortical BZRs </plain></SENT>
