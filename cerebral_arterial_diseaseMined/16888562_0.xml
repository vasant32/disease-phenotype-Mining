<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to focus for the first time on the operative management of a direct vertebral artery (VA)-posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) end-to-end anastomosis in a partially thrombosed giant VA-PICA-complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and to underline its usefulness as an additional treatment option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The operative technique of a direct VA-PICA end-to-end anatomosis is described in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The VA was entering the large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> sack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Distally, the PICA originated from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> sack-VA-complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The donor and recipient vessel were cut close to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas the VA was cut in a straight manner, the PICA was cut at an oblique 45-degree angle to enlarge the vascular end diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vessel ends were flushed with heparinized saline and sutured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The thrombotic material inside the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> sack was removed and the distal VA clipped, leaving the anterior spinal artery and brainstem perforators free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patient regained consciousness without additional morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed a completely decompressed brainstem without infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The postoperative angiograms demonstrated a good filling of the anastomosed PICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite the caliber mistmatch of these two vessels the direct VA-PICA end-to-end anastomosis provides an accurate alternative in addition to other anastomoses and bypass techniques, when donor and recipient vessels are suitable and medullary perforators do not have to be disrupted </plain></SENT>
