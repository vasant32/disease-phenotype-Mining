<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence, case fatality and risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> complicated by multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0342953" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">organ dysfunction syndrome</z:e> (MODS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in 830 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, among whom 89 also developed MODS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of MODS in these patients was 10.7% with case fatality of 58.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of concurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and increased number of organ involved both resulted in higher case fatality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The preceding health status, number of failing organs and score of neurologic impairment were the main fetal factors according to logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MODS usually occurs in two weeks after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prevention of MODS involves rigorous treatment of the compromised organs and comprehensive systemic therapy in addition to the management of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
