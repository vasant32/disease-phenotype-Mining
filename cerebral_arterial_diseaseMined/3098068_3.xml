<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and CT, we studied 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> and a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and compared these findings with those of 10 sickle cell patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose was to determine if <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> could visualize the large vessel vasculopathy previously seen on angiography and to estimate the incidence of asymptomatic abnormalities in the nonstroke group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> consistently demonstrated the major intracranial arteries and showed three cases with occlusion and three with stenosis of either the internal carotid or middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Infarctions were better delineated on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> but were also seen on CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven cases with and two without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had high-signal white matter lesions on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further research using cranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> to develop noninvasive means of identifying sickle cell patients at risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is warranted </plain></SENT>
