<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the PAD negative group the ratio alpha 2-antiplasmin/antithrombin III activity is significantly higher 1.11 +/- 0.3 in the patients with an abnormal exercise ECG typical of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects 1.02 +/- 0.2 (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the PAD positive group antithrombin III concentration is higher in patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> exercise ECG than in patients with abnormal exercise ECG (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The same is true for alpha 2-antiplasmin but not for the antithrombin III activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fibrinogen and VIIIR:Ag are higher in patients with a previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, however, the age is also significantly different as compared to the group without previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disturbance of the cerebral arterial circulation is characterized by an elevation of VIIR:Ag and of alpha 2-antiplasmin as compared to the values obtained in patients without this complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There is a general tendency towards higher alpha 2-antiplasmin values with the extension of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
