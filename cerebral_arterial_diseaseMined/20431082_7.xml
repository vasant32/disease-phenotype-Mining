<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is considerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in practice patterns between sedation in the intubated state vs nonintubated state during endovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to compare clinical and radiographic outcomes between these 2 sedation modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to middle cerebral artery-M1 segment occlusion treated with endovascular therapy between January 2006 and July 2009 were identified in our interventional <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Level of sedation was determined as intubated (IS) vs nonintubated (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="53204">NIS</z:chebi>) state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes on follow-up imaging and clinical outcomes at 3 to 6 months were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 126 patients were included (73 [58%] <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53204">NIS</z:chebi> vs 53 [42%] IS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In IS patients, intensive care unit length of stay was longer (6.5 vs 3.2 days, P=0.0008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intraprocedural complications were lower in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53204">NIS</z:chebi> patients compared with IS patients (5/73 [6%] vs 8/53 [15%], respectively), but the difference was not significant (P=0.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In univariate and multivariate analyses, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53204">NIS</z:chebi> was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (odds ratio=0.32, P=0.011), good clinical outcome (odds ratio=3.06, P=0.042), and final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (odds ratio=0.25, P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In endovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy, treatment of patients in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53204">NIS</z:chebi> appears to be as safe as treatment in IS and may result in more favorable clinical and radiographic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our preliminary observations derived from this retrospective study await confirmation from prospective trials </plain></SENT>
