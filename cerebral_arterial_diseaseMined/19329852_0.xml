<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of transcranial color-coded sonography (TCCS) for cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> with digital subtraction angiography used as the gold standard of reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-eight patients who were suspected of cerebrovascular disease were involved in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Major cerebral arteries were observed through the transcranial echo window by TCCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The course, shape of the color blood beam and velocity were given special attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hemodynamic parameter was measured and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings of TCCS were compared with the results of digital subtraction angiography, according to a double-blind design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A 4-fold table was used as the statistical analysis method to evaluate TCCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The indexes included sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and false-positive rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Imaging of TCCS revealed that the blood flow beam narrowed where the artery had stenosis and looked like girdling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The velocity of the foci increased abnormally, while the velocity before and after the foci decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Severe stenosis and the long stenotic segment may show discontinuity of the blood flow beam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The velocity of the foci did not noticeably increase or decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The blood flow beam of the occlusive artery cannot be seen and the frequency spectrum cannot be obtained, but the other artery was well visualized at the same time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the diagnostic value of TCCS according to the 4-fold table included the validity index, with a sensitivity, specificity, false-positive rate, false-negative rate, accuracy, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio and Youden index of 72.9%, 82.9%, 17.1%, 27.0%, 78.2%, 79.4%, 77.3%, 4.3, 0.3 and 0.56, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The reliability index included the agreement rate and kappa value, which were 78.2% and 0.56, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TCCS could be considered a valuable method for the screening diagnosis of cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> or occlusion </plain></SENT>
