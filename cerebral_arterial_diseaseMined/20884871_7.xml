<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to describe the frequency, patterns, and risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhages</z:hpo> in RCVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed prospective data on 89 consecutive patients with RCVS, of which 8 were postpartum and 46 used vasoactive substances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Standard bivariate and multivariate statistical tests were applied to compare patients with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty patients (34%), of which 5 were postpartum and 12 used vasoactive substances, developed at least 1 type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, including cortical subarachnoid (n = 27), intracerebral (n = 11), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hemorrhage</z:hpo> (n=2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> had an older age (46.6 versus 41.6 years, P = 0.049) and were more frequently females (90% versus 51%, P = 0.0017) or were migrainers (43% versus 19%, P = 0.022) than those without <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate testing identified 2 independent risk factors of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in RCVS: female gender (OR, 4.05; 95% CI, 1.46 to 11.2) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> (OR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.06 to 5.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> had a greater risk of persistent focal deficits (30% versus 2%, P = 0.0002), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (13% versus 2%, P = 0.039), posterior reversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> syndrome (17% versus 3%, P = 0.041) at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage, and of inability to resume <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> activities at 6 months (27% versus 0%, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In RCVS, women and migrainers seem to be at higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhages</z:hpo> are frequent in RCVS and are associated with a more severe clinical spectrum </plain></SENT>
