<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unilateral superior cervical ganglionectomy was performed in spontaneously hypertensive rats at 4 weeks of age, and wall-to-lumen ratios of cerebral arteries were determined at 5 weeks, 2 months or 5 months after denervation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To estimate the thickness of the vessel wall, a freeze substitution technique was used for the preparation of cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Basal mean arterial blood pressure measured through cannulated femoral artery was 127 +/- 2, 146 +/- 7 and 168 +/- 6 mm Hg (mean +/- S.E.M.) at 9 weeks, 3 months and 6 months of age, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The wall-to-lumen ratios in the denervated and innervated hemispheres were 0.124 +/- 0.004 and 0.129 +/- 0.005 at 9 weeks, 0.127 +/- 0.003 and 0.169 +/- 0.004 (P less than 0.02 vs denervated) at 3 months, and 0.194 +/- 0.007 and 0.222 +/- 0.006 (P less than 0.05 vs denervated) at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of denervation was more significant in downstream vessels (diameter less than or equal to 100 microns) than larger ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that wall-to-lumen ratio is correlated well with a rise in basal blood pressure, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> interruption of the sympathetic nerves attenuates <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> occurrence of vascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> during the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
