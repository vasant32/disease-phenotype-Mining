<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcome of 40 cases with middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion was examined in relation to the site of occlusion and the findings on computed tomography (CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated conservatively without surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A few had decompressive craniotomy when necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcome in 7 (18%) was good, in 6 (15%) moderate, and in 15 (38%) severe; 12 (30%) died by the follow-up at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cases with occlusion at the origin of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, hypodensity on CT scan was usually localized to the basal ganglia, presumably because of collateral circulation through the anterior cerebral arteries; the outcome in these patients was not always favorable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases with occlusion of the trunk or branch vessels always showed marked CT hypodensity, and clinical outcome was poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To assess quantitatively the extent of collateral circulation, the conduction time of contrast medium from the intracranial siphon (IC) to the insular portion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (M2) through the anterior cerebral arteries was calculated on serial carotid angiograms obtained within 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An IC-M2 time of 5 seconds was a critical indicator of whether extensive CT hypodensity would develop (the rule of 5 seconds) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this method predicted the appearance and extent of infarction before CT revealed hypodensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The significance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> reconstructive surgery is also discussed </plain></SENT>
