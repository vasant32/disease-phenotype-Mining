<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: A new data acquisition system for transcranial 3 D-ultrasonography was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study examines the evaluation of intracranial cerebral arteries by 3 D-ultrasound and echo contrast agents in comparison to cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten patients, who underwent diagnostic cerebral angiography, were examined without knowledge of the angiographic results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data acquisition through the transtemporal acoustic bone window was performed with a magnetic sensor system to track the spatial orientation of the ultrasound probe while scanning the volume of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used a transcranial duplex system with power mode and stored a 3 D-data set before injection of transpulmonary stable contrast medium and afterwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ipsilateral to the transducer anterior cerebral artery (ACA) in 90%, middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) in 90%, three or more branches of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in 60% and posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) in 40% were analysed without injecting an echo contrast agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the contrast injection ACA, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, branches of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> in 100% were visible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 70% of cases the posterior and anterior communicating arteries were visualised only by means of a contrast agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Application of a transpulmonary stable ultrasound contrast agent in combination with 3 D transcranial duplex ultrasonography significantly enhances the visualisation of intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
