<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-six patients were proved to have a discrete morphologic brain lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pathologic processes were demonstrated by the sequential scanning technique in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In nearly a third of these 46 patients (28%), careful observation of the progressive and subtle changes in radioactivity in the whole sequential scan series was necessary for detection of the lesions: they could not be appreciated on any single static scan when viewed independently </plain></SENT>
