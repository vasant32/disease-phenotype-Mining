<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We carried out this cross-sectional study to explore the association between cerebral large artery lesions and leukoaraiosis in Chinese patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationship between leukoaraiosis and risk factors of cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were prospectively collected from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> within 7 days of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent three-dimensional time of flight magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and contrast-enhanced MRA for evaluating intracranial and extracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Leukoaraiosis grading was performed according to age-related white matter changes rating scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 121 patients (65.4%) had significant stenosis or occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of distinct leukoaraiosis between the mild or no stenosis group and the significant stenosis or occlusion group was not significantly different (odd ratios: 0.97; 95% confidence interval: 0.46-2.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup analysis, distinct leukoaraiosis was more frequently observed in the multiple lesions group than in the single lesion group (odd ratios: 4.15; 95% confidence interval: 1.32-13.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age (odd ratios: 2.659; 95% confidence interval: 1.217-5.809), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (odd ratios: 4.690; 95% confidence interval: 0.947-23.242), smoking (odd ratios: 4.039; 95% confidence interval: 1.340-12.174) and the level of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (odd ratios: 0.438; 95% confidence interval: 0.215-0.891) were independently associated with distinct leukoaraiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is a lack of a relationship between cerebral large <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and leukoaraiosis, but multiple large artery stenoses may increase the risk of leukoaraiosis </plain></SENT>
