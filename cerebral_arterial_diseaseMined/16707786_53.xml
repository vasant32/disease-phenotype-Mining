<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>APP transgenic mice receiving either anti-Abeta (2H6) or deglycosylated anti-Abeta (de-2H6) showed significant improvement in radial arm water maze performance compared with mice receiving a control antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both groups receiving anti-Abeta antibodies showed significant reductions in total Abeta immunochemistry and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34653">Congo red</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significantly fewer vascular amyloid deposits and microhemorrhages were observed in mice administered the de-2H6 antibody compared with those receiving unmodified 2H6 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Deglycosylated anti-Abeta antibodies may be preferable to unmodified IgG because they retain the cognition-enhancing and amyloid-reducing properties of anti-Abeta immunotherapy, while greatly attenuating the increased vascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath> and microhemorrhage observed with unmodified IgG </plain></SENT>
