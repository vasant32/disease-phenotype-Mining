<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the chromosomal localization of the gene, 20 human-rodent somatic cell hybrids and a full-length cystatin C cDNA probe were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Southern blot analysis of BamHI digested cell hybrid DNA revealed that the probe recognizes a 10.6 kb human specific fragment and that this fragment cosegregates with human chromosome 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the human cystatin C gene (CST3) was assigned to chromosome 20 </plain></SENT>
