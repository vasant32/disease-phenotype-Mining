<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunts</z:hpo> (RLS) can be identified by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) as well as by transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) using contrast agents, such as Echovist-200 or Echovist-300 in conjunction with a Valsalva maneuver (VM) as provocation procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both Echovist preparations are in use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently, the appropriate timing of the VM is still under debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-four patients were investigated by both TEE and bilateral TCD of the middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following protocol was applied in a randomized way: (1) no VM, (2) VM for 5 s starting with the beginning of Echovist-300 injection, (3) VM for 5 s starting 5 s after the beginning of Echovist-300 injection, (4) VM for 5 s starting 10 s after the beginning of Echovist-300 injection, and (5) VM for 5 s starting 5 s after the beginning of Echovist-200 injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 27 patients, an RLS was demonstrated by both TEE and contrast TCD (shunt-positive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients were negative in both investigations, no patient was positive on TEE but negative on TCD, 15 patients were only positive on at least one TCD investigation but negative on TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tests 3 and 5 were the most appropriate ones; test 3 was slightly superior to test 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TCD using Echovist-300 or Echovist-200 is a sensitive method to identify TEE-proven cardiac RLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To achieve the best diagnostic accuracy, the VM should be performed for a duration of 5 s starting at 5 s following the beginning of contrast injection </plain></SENT>
