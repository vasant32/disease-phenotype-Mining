<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective chart analysis and radiologic studies were performed in 24 patients (aged 20-87 years) with a dural AVF treated with percutaneous transvenous embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lesions were located in the transverse and/or sigmoid or superior sagittal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up was 3-44 (mean, 10.8) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After percutaneous transvenous embolization of 24 dural AVFs, there was complete occlusion in 17 patients, important flow reduction in three, and moderate flow reduction in four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients were clinically cured, 17 with complete occlusion and three with important flow reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with moderate flow reduction, clinical improvement was good in two and moderate in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient remained clinically unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A transient complication was seen in one patient, and a permanent complication was seen in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient, whose preexisting clinical status was poor, died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During long-term follow-up, the condition of two patients worsened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Percutaneous transvenous embolization appears to be effective in the treatment of dural AVFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>More experience is needed to evaluate long-term results </plain></SENT>
