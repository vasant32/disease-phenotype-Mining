<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is realized that the CVR improves or worsens when measured periodically during the clinical course in medically treated patients with occlusive cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these patients, we investigated the possible relationship between the interval change in CVR and that in systemic blood pressure (BP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-two patients (14 females and 28 males, mean age +/- SD: 65.3 +/- 8.8 years) with severe stenosis or occlusion of the common carotid, internal carotid, or middle cerebral arteries repeatedly underwent single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies using 123I-iodoamphetamine to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) distribution and CVR at a more-than-6-month interval (mean +/- SD: 18.5 +/- 8.8 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CVR was separately estimated in cerebral hemispheres ipsilateral and contralateral to the most severe vascular lesion as the % increase in CBF after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> loading to CBF at rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Systemic BP was measured four times at enrollment and the follow-up SPECT studies during resting and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> loading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Average BP at each SPECT study was an average of BP measurements during resting and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> loading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interval changes in CVR were correlated with those in average systolic BP, average diastolic BP, and average mean arterial BP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The interval changes in CVR were significantly correlated with those in average diastolic BP in the ipsilateral hemisphere (y = 0.71x + 1.43, r2 = 0.11, p &lt; 0.05) and in the contralateral hemisphere (y = 0.88x - 0.46, r2 = 0.16, p &lt; 0.05) but not with those in average systolic BP or average mean arterial BP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In medically treated patients with steno-occlusive carotid artery or middle cerebral artery lesions, the interval change in CVR to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> by means of 123I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> SPECT was influenced by the diastolic BP at the SPECT studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Monitoring diastolic BP is important to evaluate interval change in CVR </plain></SENT>
