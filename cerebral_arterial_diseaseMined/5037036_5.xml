<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first case was that of massive pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> due to an occlusion of the basilar artery trapped in the fracture of the clivus, 13 days before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The second case, also with a pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, survived for two and two-thirds months; the trauma was probably similar, but the presence of the basal skull fracture and the occlusion of the basilar artery can be surmised only in retrospect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The third case was one of delayed rupture of the basilar artery occurring three to four weeks after the injury, which caused aneurysmal formation in the left posterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
