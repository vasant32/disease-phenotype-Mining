<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe here the cloning and characterization of a rat homolog of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The predicted amino acid sequence of rat CXCR3 contains 367 amino acid residues, sharing 96 and 87% amino acid sequence identity to the murine and human CXCR3, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among a large panel of chemokines tested, only interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), interferon-gamma-induced monokine, and interferon-inducible T cell alpha-chemoattractant demonstrated specific abilities to induce an intracellular calcium mobilization response in human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with rat CXCR3 expression vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(125)I-IP-10 competition binding studies to the CXCR3-transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells demonstrated that human IP-10 and interferon-inducible T cell alpha-chemoattractant are more potent ligands than human interferon-gamma-induced monokine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following our previous observation for the induced expression of IP-10 in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we demonstrate here the time-dependent up-regulation of CXCR3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the rat ischemic cortex after permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in (125)I-IP-10-specific binding to ischemic cerebral cortical samples was obtained and paralleled the increase in CXCR3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The changes in receptor expression and ligand binding correlate highly with known changes in leukocyte accumulation, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> occurred after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that CXCR3/IP-10 may be a potential novel therapeutic target in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the cloning of rat CXCR3 provides an important tool for the investigation of the pathophysiological role of CXCR3 in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035801" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rodent disease</z:e> models </plain></SENT>
