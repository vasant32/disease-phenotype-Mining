<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The balloon catheter technique is being utilized in various intravascular procedures and transluminal angioplasty, but the type of morphological changes which take place in intracranial vessels after balloon inflation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> are still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study reports on morphological changes in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> canine basilar arteries after transluminal angioplasty (TA) with 1.5 Atmospheres of inflation pressure and 30% <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histological changes 1 h after TA consisted of denudation of endothelial cells, deposition of fibrin which covered the denuded endothelium, stretching and focal dehiscence of internal elastic lamina and altered myocytes in media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These morphological changes were more prominent when the balloon was inflated longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven days after TA, however, the endothelium had been regenerated almost completely, while slight <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> changes still remained in the internal elastic lamina and media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiographical and morphometrical analyses did not disclose any significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This report proposes that under some conditions intra-arterial inflation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the intracranial arteries causes reversible changes, which are noted mainly in the endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, a new in vivo experimental model which could be of use for physiological or pathophysiological investigations of intracranial arteries is introduced </plain></SENT>
