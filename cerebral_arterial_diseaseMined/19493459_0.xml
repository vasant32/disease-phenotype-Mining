<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the this study was to report the incidence of fenestration in the proximal segment of the anterior cerebral artery and to delineate its configurations on cranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) was performed in 762 patients using 1.5 T imagers during the period July 2007 through September 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> images were obtained by the three-dimensional time-of-flight (3D TOF) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Volume rendering (VR) images in the horizontal rotation view were displayed stereoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of fenestration in the proximal segment of the anterior cerebral artery was identified and evaluated retrospectively by MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six patients (four men and two women, 15 to 63 years of age, median age 50 years) had proximal ACA fenestration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The appearance rate of ACA fenestration was 0.8% (6/762) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 6 fenestrations were located at the A1 segment: three of them were with a slit-like shape and three were with a convex-lens-like shape, 5 of the right A1 segment, 1 of the left A1 segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Recognizing ACA fenestration is important to interpret cranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiographys and helpful to make a plan for neurosurgical procedures or neurological intervention </plain></SENT>
