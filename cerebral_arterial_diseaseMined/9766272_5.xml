<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentation was a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, that is the sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> while she was driving her car </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> symptoms disappeared in about a week </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuroradiological investigations showed the association between the two distal AICA malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At surgery it was possible either to clip the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> or to remove the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This association is rare at the AICA level </plain></SENT>
