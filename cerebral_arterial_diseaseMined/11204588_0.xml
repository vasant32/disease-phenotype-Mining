<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Knowledge of the costs of oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (AC) treatment may be relevant for resource allocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Also, the incremental costs may be compared with other treatments for health care policy decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, we have assessed actual costs of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy in anticoagulation clinics (AC-clinic) in three different settings in the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Costs of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> drug supply and costs as a result of INR-adjustment procedures were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared the total costs of treatment in patients treated after minor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Prevention in Reversible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> Trial (SPIRIT) and in patients treated because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306889" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">peripheral arterial occlusive disease</z:e> in the Dutch Bypass Oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> or Aspirin Trial (BOA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Costs of monitoring ranged between Euro 6.44 and Euro 9.87 per visit for monitoring at the AC-clinic and at home, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The annual costs of administering <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> drugs ranged between Euro 83 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50438">phenprocoumon</z:chebi>) and 107 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53766,53768,53769">acenocoumarol</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Variation in the overall actual annual costs of AC treatment was caused by the number of monitoring visits, the distribution of home and clinic visits and, to a lesser extent, the medication used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Annual costs of AC therapy for patients in SPIRIT was Euro 239 and for patients in BOA Euro 312 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall costs of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy were about 3 to 4-fold higher than standard treatment with aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the actual costs of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy may be substantially higher than that of other antithrombotic therapies, its cost-effectiveness depends highly on efficacy </plain></SENT>
