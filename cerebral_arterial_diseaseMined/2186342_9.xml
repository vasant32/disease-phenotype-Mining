<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Substantial pitfalls may result from: A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Physics of sound waves and Doppler instruments (errors due to high pass filter cut off, aliasing, rapid image update) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quality and adjustment of the Doppler instrument (errors due to low sensitivity, inappropriate adjustment of Doppler controls, inadequate wall filter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Examination technique (errors due to an unfavourable angle of incidence or due to transducer-induced pressure: decrease predominantly in diastolic flow velocity-increase in maximum flow velocity in the straight sinus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamics (errors due to spatial or temporal variations of the flow profile, pulsatility, non-uniform distribution of cerebral blood flow/CBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cerebral vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> (errors due to an unfavourable probe position as related to the three-dimensional arrangement of vessels, inadequate separation of closely adjacent vessels) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>F </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Interpretation (flow velocity or Resistance Index/RI is taken to equal CBF, RI is taken to equal peripheral vascular resistance, one artery is taken to represent the cerebral circulation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Pitfalls may be avoided by using adequate means (low wall filter adjustment, high Doppler frequency, critical assessment of velocity spectra) to reduce the likelihood of errors occurring </plain></SENT>
