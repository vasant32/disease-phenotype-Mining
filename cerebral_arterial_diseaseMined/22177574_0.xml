<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the causes to insufficient blood supply is cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the feasibility of bioimpedance for monitoring such stenosis was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Simulations were conducted on a realistic numerical model of the head, focusing on the left middle cerebral artery (LMCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissues were assumed to act as linear isotropic volume conductors, and the quasi-static approximation was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electrical potentials were calculated by solving Poisson's equation, using the finite volume method (FVM) and the successive over relaxation (SOR) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The best sensitivity found was 0.471 Î¼V/% stenosis, using this electrode configuration: one injector near the left eye and the other injector near the right ear, one measurement position near the left eye and the other one in the right ear, keeping a distance of at least 2.5 cm between measurement and injection positions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The maximal sensitivity achieved in the numerical model under the applied assumptions supports the feasibility of bioimpedance technique for monitoring cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, according to sensitivity [1/m(4)] maps, calculated for the preferable electrode configurations, the measurements' specificity to the stenosis degree might be inadequate and should be further studied </plain></SENT>
