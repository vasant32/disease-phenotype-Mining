<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, our purpose was to determine the clinical utility of MSCTA in evaluation of extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven (4 men and 7 women; mean age, 46 years; age range, 19-68 years) consecutive patients who underwent MSCTA and DSA after EC-IC bypass surgery were evaluated retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent DSA within 3 weeks of MSCTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The indications for EC-IC bypass were severe stenosis or occlusion of intracranial arteries in seven patients and therapeutic occlusion of intracranial artery for unclippable giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten patients underwent superficial temporal artery (STA)-middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) bypass and one patient underwent occipital artery-posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypasses in six patients were patent on MSCTA which were confirmed on DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypasses and one occipital artery-posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) bypass were occluded in three patients on MSCTA and DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In one patient, minimal stenosis of the STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass was identified on MSCTA and DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 1 patient, STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass was not well seen on MSCTA and suspected for occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DSA identified the occlusion of bypass on this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MSCTA seems to be a very promising noninvasive technique in evaluation of EC-IC bypass </plain></SENT>
