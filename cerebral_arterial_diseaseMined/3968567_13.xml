<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the natural history and utility of SEP's during experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and infarction, SEP's were measured in 17 adult cats at 24 hours and 1 hour prior to right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion, and again immediately afterward and at either 6 hours (five cats) or 24 hours (six cats) post-occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before occlusion of the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, the SEP's were identical in the right and left hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After occlusion, there was a significant slowing of the interpeak latency of the first positive peak (P1) in the right hemisphere (3.53 +/- 0.6 msec before compared to 3.99 +/- 0.6 msec after occlusion, p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Maximal slowing in right hemisphere P1 latency was seen in those animals in which the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> extended into the thalamus (4.38 +/- 0.1 msec) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was significantly slower than left hemisphere values (3.92 +/- 0.32 msec, p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ipsilateral cortical components of the SEP's, the second positive peak (P2), and the major negative deflection (MN) were slowed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cats immediately after right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion compared to preocclusion measurements (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the mid-suprasylvian and posterior ectosylvian gyri (including the somatosensory cortex) resulted in a greater slowing of the latency of MN compared to less severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in that region (20.6 +/- 3.9 msec versus 16.4 +/- 1.1 msec, p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a precipitous decrease in the amplitude or voltage of the ipsilateral P2-MN complex immediately after occlusion (5.32 +/- 0.4 microV before compared to 0.98 +/- 0.3 microV after occlusion, p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the central latencies and cortical amplitudes of the SEP's are sensitive experimental tools as indicators of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and extent of a cerebral ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
