<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine changes of cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen metabolism, and vascular reserve capacity associated with severity of WML in patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we used a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighteen lacunar patients were divided into two groups according to the severity of WMLs, assessed by Fazekas classification; grades 0 to 1 as mild WML group and grades 2 to 3 as severe WML group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rapid dual autoradiography was performed with (15)O-labeled gas-PET followed by (15)O-labeled water-PET with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> (ACZ) challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with the mild WML group, the severe WML group showed lower CBF (20.6±4.4 versus 29.9±8.2 mL/100 g per minute, P=0.008), higher oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) (55.2±7.4 versus 46.7±5.3%, P=0.013), and lower cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO(2)) (1.95±0.41 versus 2.44±0.42 mL/100 g per minute, P=0.025) in the centrum semiovale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the ACZ reactivity between the two groups (48.6±22.6% versus 42.5±17.2%, P=0.524) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lacunar patients with severe WMLs exhibited reduced CBF and CMRO(2), and increased OEF in the centrum semiovale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ACZ reactivity was preserved in both patients with severe and mild WMLs in each site of the brain </plain></SENT>
