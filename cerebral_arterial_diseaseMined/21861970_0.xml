<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To seek evidence of neurovascular compression of motor cranial nerves (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17514">CNs</z:chebi>) in otherwise idiopathic neuropathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000486'>strabismus</z:hpo> using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, observational case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: High-resolution, surface coil orbital MRI was performed in 10 strabismic patients with idiopathic oculomotor (CN III) or abducens (CN VI) palsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relationships between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17514">CNs</z:chebi> and intracranial arteries were demonstrated by 0.8-mm thick, 162-μm resolution, heavily T2-weighted MRI in fast imaging using steady-state acquisition sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Images were analyzed digitally to evaluate cross-sectional areas of extraocular muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In one patient with CN III palsy, an ectatic posterior communicating artery markedly flattened and thinned the ipsilateral subarachnoid CN III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cross-sections of the affected medial, superior, and inferior rectus muscles 10 mm posterior to the globe-optic nerve junction were 17.2 ± 2.5 mm(2), 15.5 ± 1.3 mm(2), and 9.9 ± 0.8 mm(2), significantly smaller than the values of 23.6 ± 1.9 mm(2), 30.4 ± 4.1 mm(2), and 28.8 ± 4.6 mm(2), respectively, of the unaffected side (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients with otherwise unexplained CN VI palsy, ectatic basilar arteries contacted CN VI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean cross-sections of affected lateral rectus muscles were 24.0 ± 2.3 mm(2) and 29.8 ± 3.1 mm(2), significantly smaller than the values of 33.5 ± 4.1 mm(2) and 36.9 ± 1.6 mm(2), respectively, in unaffected contralateral eyes (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nonaneurysmal motor CN compression should be considered as a cause of CN III and CN VI <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>neurogenic muscle atrophy</z:hpo> when MRI demonstrates vascular distortion of the involved CN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Demonstration of a benign vascular cause can terminate continuing diagnostic investigations and can expedite rational management of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000486'>strabismus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
