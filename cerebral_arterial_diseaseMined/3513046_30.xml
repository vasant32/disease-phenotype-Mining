<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The time course of vasospasm as evaluated by this technique was similar to that reported in angiographic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 82% of the patients an increase in intracranial velocities to 120 cm/s or more was found during the second or third week after <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Arterial narrowing giving rise to velocities above 200 cm/s was classified as severe spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This occurred in 42% of the cases, and a significant decrease in flow velocity in the extracranial carotid artery was found in this group </plain></SENT>
