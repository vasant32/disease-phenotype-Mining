<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients had follow-up visual field examinations, the average follow-up period being 6.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in prognosis of the ocular course between patients with Po/C equal to or greater than 100 and those with Po/C less than 100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of splinter <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> at the optic disk (10% of affected eyes) or of systemic arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (diastolic blood pressure greater than 100 mm Hg) was associated with progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defects</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> or associated hemodynamic events (33% of the total patients) had a more favorable prognosis regarding stability (lack of progression) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defects</z:hpo> than those without such an event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extension of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defects</z:hpo> across the macula was a common finding (25% of affected eyes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No firm evidence was obtained to indicate that treatment of the low-tension <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> improved the prognosis of the ocular course </plain></SENT>
