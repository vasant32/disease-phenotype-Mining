<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>Air embolism</z:mpath> to the cerebral artery circulation is a rare complication previously associated with surgery, scuba-diving, induced abortion, angiography, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> secondary to a ruptured air <z:mp ids='MP_0008854'>bulla</z:mp> during commercial air travel has rarely been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We report a patient who became unconsciousness 30 minutes after her plane took off </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patient was found to have an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in a watershed distribution secondary to multiple, bilateral, intraparenchymal air bubbles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further investigation revealed a large lung <z:mp ids='MP_0008854'>bulla</z:mp> with an air-fluid level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>Air embolism</z:mpath> was due to rupture of the lung <z:mp ids='MP_0008854'>bulla</z:mp> into the pulmonary venous outflow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whether the rupture was spontaneous or due to a stretch injury from a change of air pressure resulting in pulmonary barotrauma occurring during commercial air travel is uncertain </plain></SENT>
