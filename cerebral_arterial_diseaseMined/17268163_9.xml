<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An investigation of 101 consecutive patients with sudden-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> due to a single or multiple lesions on DWI, corresponding to 8.7% of 1,160 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of lesions of the cranial arteries was sought by magnetic resonance angiography and reviewed with a three-dimensional rotating cineangiographic method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>Dysarthria</z:hpo> was mostly associated with a supratentorial lesion (63%) and with a classic lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> syndrome in 45% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lacunar lesions on DWI were found in 69 (68%) patients, while only 45 of the patients (65%) with a lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> presented a classic lacunar syndrome with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pure <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> occurred in 15% of patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> + pure motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> in 14%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> + ataxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> in 11%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> + clumsy hand syndrome in 7%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> + pure sensory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 3%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> + central facial <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> in 8% and lingual <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> occurred in 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lesions were due to small-artery disease in 41%, large-artery disease in 15%, cardioembolism in 10% and a mixed etiology in 3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was not identified in 17 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lesions on DWI were found mainly in the <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata (n = 18), middle cerebral artery territory, including the motor cortex and/or insular cortex (n = 13), striatocaudate nuclei (n = 11), primary motor cortex (n = 10), internal capsule (n = 7), pons (n = 25), pontobulbar junction (n = 5) and the thalamomesencephalic junction (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarctions</z:e> (n = 6) or associated brainstem lesions (n = 6) affected mostly the superior cerebellar artery or the posterior inferior cerebellar artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cortical involvement was more frequent in patients with pure <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> than those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> and additional neurological signs, while the frequency of pontine involvement was higher in patients with additional neurological signs than those with pure <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One third of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> had multiple lesions on DWI, and the most common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was small-artery disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pure <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> with lingual <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> with clumsy hand and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> with facial <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> had predictive value for lacunar lesions </plain></SENT>
