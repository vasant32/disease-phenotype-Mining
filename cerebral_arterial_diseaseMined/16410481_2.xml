<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">Positron</z:chebi> emission tomography was used to investigate 40 patients with major cerebral artery occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ratio of cerebral blood volume to cerebral blood flow (CBV/CBF) and vasoreactivity in response to <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> (%CBF(<z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp>)) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> (ACZ) stress (%CBF(ACZ)) were measured to evaluate circulatory reserve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) was measured to evaluate metabolic reserve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To detect relationships between circulation reserve and OEF, cerebral hemispheres were grouped into 5 or 6 stepwise groups based on reduction of circulation reserve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: OEF was significantly elevated in hemispheres with CBV/CBF &gt; or =0.11 minutes and in hemispheres with %CBF(<z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp>) &lt;0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OEF was significantly increased according to %CBF(ACZ) in hemispheres with %CBF(ACZ) &lt;15% and plateaued at levels below -15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic reserve consumption began at CBV/CBF &gt; or =0.11 minutes, CBF(<z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp>) &lt;0%, and CBF(ACZ) &lt;15% </plain></SENT>
