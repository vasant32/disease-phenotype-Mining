<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed 47 examinations with a 1.5-T system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used coronal 3D fast imaging with steady precession (FISP), axial 3D tilted optimised nonsaturating excitation (TONE) and 2D fast low-angle shot (FLASH) for the carotid bifurcation, axial 3D TONE with or without magnetisation transfer (MT) for intracranial arteries, and axial 3D FISP or TONE for the aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evaluation included visual assessment of image quality and grading of stenoses near the carotid bifurcation; digital subtraction angiography was used as the reference method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Axial 3D TONE gave superior image quality at the carotid bifurcation, MT-TONE intracranially, and 3D FISP for the aortic arch vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, sensitivity and specificity for detection of significant stenoses were similar with coronal 3D FISP (96.3%, 94.0%), axial 3D TONE (92.6%, 92.5%) and axial 2D FLASH (96.3%, 86.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Image quality at the aortic arch needs further improvement </plain></SENT>
