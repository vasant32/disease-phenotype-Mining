<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to demonstrate the macrovascular disease in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-induced diabetic rats and assess any possible differences between the histopatholological changes of the coronaries and cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hearts and brains were obtained after 4 weeks (short-term experimental <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 10 rats) and 12 weeks (long-term experimental <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 10 rats) of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sham injected, control rats were studied in parallel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Muscular-type arteries of 0.10-0.15 mm were examined and semiquantitatively classified either as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, or slightly, or moderately, or severely thickened by light microscopy: While the arterial wall appeared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sham-injected rats, a varying degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> of the muscular layer and deposition of fibrinoid material resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> was prominent in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-injected rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the group of short-term <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> there was a slight thickening of the cerebral arteries in the majority of the rats (8/10 rats), while thickening of the coronaries was moderate (9/10 rats) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further progression of arterial wall thickening in both cerebral and coronary arteries was observed in the long-term diabetic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean severity of lesions was significantly higher in the coronaries than in cerebral arteries, both in the short-term (p &lt; 0.0005) and long-term <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, by paired statistics within individual animals, we confirmed that wall thickening was significantly more severe in coronaries than cerebral arteries in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest an accelerated progress of macrovascular disease in the heart as compared to the brain in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-induced diabetic rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although histopathological changes in humans do not always mirror clinical severity, the differences in the macrovascular disease between heart and brain in experimental <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be relevant to the higher relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> for people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, as compared to people without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
