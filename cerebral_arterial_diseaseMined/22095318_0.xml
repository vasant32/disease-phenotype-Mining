<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to determine whether early and late/early images on 123I-iomazenil (IMZ) single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) correlate with cerebral blood flow (CBF) images and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) images on PET, respectively, in the cerebral cortex of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> unilateral middle cerebral artery or internal carotid artery occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and in 68 patients, CBF and OEF were assessed using <z:chebi fb="2" ids="36932">15O</z:chebi>-PET, and brain SPECT scans were initiated immediately after (early images) and 180 min after (late images) the administration of 123I-IMZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A region of interest was automatically placed in the middle cerebral artery territory in both cerebral hemispheres using a three-dimensional stereotaxic region of interest template, and the ratio of the value in the affected side to that in the contralateral side was calculated in each image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among patients, a significant positive correlation was observed between PET-CBF ratios and the SPECT-early IMZ ratios (r=0.797, P&lt;0.0001) as well as between the PET-OEF ratios and the SPECT-late/early IMZ ratios (r=0.679, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When an abnormally elevated PET-OEF ratio was defined as a value greater than the mean+2 SD obtained in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> participants, the SPECT-late/early IMZ ratios yielded 100% sensitivity and 93% specificity, with 76% positive-predictive and 100% negative-predictive values for detecting abnormally elevated PET-OEF ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early and late/early images on 123I-IMZ SPECT correlate with CBF images and OEF images on PET, respectively, in the cerebral cortex of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> unilateral major cerebral artery occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
