<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated no benefit of bypass surgery for such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this light, outcome in patients with misery perfusion has regained interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether misery perfusion is still a predictor of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> despite recent improvements in medical treatment for secondary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and if so, whether the predictive value of misery perfusion has changed in recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We prospectively studied 165 non-disabled patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery occlusive diseases who underwent <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography from 1999 to 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Misery perfusion was defined as decreased cerebral blood flow, increased oxygen extraction fraction and decreased ratio of cerebral blood flow to blood volume in the hemisphere supplied by the diseased artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed up for 2 years until <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bypass surgery was performed in 19 of 35 patients with and 16 of 130 patients without misery perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 2-year incidence of ipsilateral ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was six and four patients with and without misery perfusion, including two and one after surgery, respectively (P &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Total <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred in nine patients with misery perfusion and 12 patients without (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The relative risk conferred by misery perfusion in whole sample was 6.3 (95% confidence interval 1.7-22.4, P &lt; 0.005) for ipsilateral ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 3.5 (95% confidence interval 1.4-8.9, P &lt; 0.01) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, while the respective values in medically treated patients were 12.6 (95% confidence interval 2.7-57.8, P &lt; 0.005) and 4.7 (95% confidence interval 1.3-16.3, P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence in patients entering the study from 2004 to 2008 (4/72) was significantly lower than in those entering from 1999 to 2003 (17/93; P &lt; 0.02), although the prevalence of misery perfusion or bypass surgery did not differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Between these periods, patients without misery perfusion demonstrated a decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate (from 16.2% to 0%), but patients with misery perfusion did not (26.3 and 25.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In symptomatic major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral artery disease</z:e>, misery perfusion remains a predictor of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, although the recurrence rate was lower than the previous study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In patients without misery perfusion, the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was reduced over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thus, identification and stricter management of patients with misery perfusion are essential to further improve prognosis </plain></SENT>
