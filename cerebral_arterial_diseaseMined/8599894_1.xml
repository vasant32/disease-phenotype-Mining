<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with and without unilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> of the vertebral artery (VA) lumen were identified and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were further divided into two groups: with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subjects underwent a BAEP examination in three head positions: neutral position, extreme right and extreme left rotation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and unilateral VA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath>, and following the rotation away from the non-hypoplastic vessel a statistically significant decrease in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> wave amplitude and prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> wave latency was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Head maneuvers in subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood pressure or in hypertensive patients with symmetrical VA did not cause significant changes in BAEP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results document the effect of head rotation in subjects with potentially impaired collateral flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An increase in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> wave latency and decrease in its amplitude may reflect subtle changes in the brainstem perfusion in hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These changes maybe due to a reduced capacity to compensate for dynamic obstruction of VA following the head rotations </plain></SENT>
