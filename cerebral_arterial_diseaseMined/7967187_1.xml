<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the pre and post-operative perfusion reserve using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690,31163">Diamox</z:chebi> 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT in 7 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> occlusive cerebral arteries and then compared the results with PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis was performed on 5 patients, while a carotid endarterectomy was done on 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cerebral blood flow, the vascular response to <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690,31163">Diamox</z:chebi>, the oxygen extraction fraction and transit time (CBV/CBF) were measured by PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the pre-operative state, the visual evaluations for hypoperfusion area at rest were agreed in 5 out of 7 patients in HMPAO SPECT and PET studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 2 patients, hypoperfusion areas were only detected in the PET study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pre-operative evaluation of perfusion reserve was agreed in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 5 patients, 3 patients showed definite positive(++) in PET and positive(+) in HMPAO SPECT, and one patient showed positive (+) in PET and negative (-) in HMPAO SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The post-operative change of hypoperfusion areas was well agreed in HMPAO SPECT and PET studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the change of perfusion reserve was underestimated in HMPAO SPECT compared with PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the semiquantitative and quantitative analyses, the count rate ratios (affected/unaffected side) in HMPAO SPECT were apparently higher than those of CBF in PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The postoperative change of the count rate ratios in HMPAO SPECT were smaller than those of CBF in PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between the change in the ratio of the HMPAO SPECT after the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690,31163">Diamox</z:chebi> and the oxygen extraction fraction, and it was thus thought to be impossible to predict the areas with an increased oxygen extraction fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690,31163">Diamox</z:chebi> HMPAO SPECT may underestimate the areas of hypoperfusion or decrease in perfusion reserve when compared with PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We should consider these limitations in the evaluation of pre and post operative cerebral hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
