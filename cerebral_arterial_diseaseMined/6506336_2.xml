<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was confined to the recovery of cortical evoked potentials (CEP) while at pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was confirmed that this was a very severe model; few dogs achieved full recovery and three failed to show any recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Injecting 0.4 ml of air into the right internal carotid artery was seen to be as effective in suppressing function in the left hemisphere as in the right </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The level of recovery with compression treatment as a percentage of control was directly related to the level to which CEP was suppressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No other physiological correlates were found with either the degree of CEP suppression or the degree of recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nor was any improvement observed in the rate or maximum amount of recovery at any time out to 20 min as a result of pressures greater than 2.8 bar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, no treatment surpassed oxygen at 2.8 bar </plain></SENT>
