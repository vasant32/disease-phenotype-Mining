<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CARASIL <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> is histopathologically characterized by intense <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> without the deposition of granular osmiophilic materials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Until now, the obliterative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> is the presumptive cause of subcortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in CARASIL; however, a detailed vascular pathology leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0006994'>diffuse leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined two autopsied CARASIL brains in comparison with an autopsy case of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> with subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> (CADASIL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intensity of arterial sclerotic changes of CARASIL was evaluated by sclerotic index analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical investigations were performed using a battery of primary antibodies, which recognized vascular cellular and extracellular components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a result, sclerotic changes were disclosed to be mild and infrequent in CARASIL, in contrast to CADASIL that showed severe obliterative arterial changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In CARASIL, conversely, most of the arteries were centrifugally enlarged and some were collapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We further revealed that arterial medial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in patients with CARASIL were extensively lost, even in arteries without sclerotic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Arterial adventitia in CARASIL was conspicuously thin and immunoreactivities for type I, III, and VI collagens and fibronectin were appreciably weak in this region, indicating a reduction in the mural extracellular matrix (ECM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because of the medial and adventitial degeneration, CARASIL brains likely receive marked fluctuations in blood flow because of deviations in the structural and functional basis of autoregulation mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We thus consider that <z:hpo ids='HP_0006994'>diffuse leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> in CARASIL may be caused by arterial medial SMC loss with mural ECM reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We speculate that the abnormalities in the ECM are causatively related to the SMC degeneration, since the ECM is a crucial signal determining the biophysiological properties of arterial SMCs </plain></SENT>
