<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The drug was given i.p. once or several times a day from 1 week after occlusion for 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A single administration of TRH (1 and 10 mg/kg) did not affect the neurological deficits, but recovery of the deficits was accelerated by multiple administration (7 times a day) of TRH and single administration (once a day) of YM-14673 (N alpha-[[(S)-4-oxo-2-azetidinyl]<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi>]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29979,32514">L-histidyl</z:chebi>-L-prolinamide dihydrate), a new TRH analogue with a longer half-life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both YM-14673 and single (1 and 10 mg/kg) and multiple administration of TRH ameliorated the disturbance of passive avoidance learning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>Neuronal degeneration</z:mp> in the cerebral cortex and striatum was not influenced by the administration of TRH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, we found that neurological deficits and disturbance of passive avoidance learning behavior in middle cerebral artery-occluded rats could be ameliorated by administration of TRH </plain></SENT>
