<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Intracranial vertebral endarterectomy was performed on six patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar insufficiency</z:e> in whom medical therapy failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients underwent operations for stenotic plaque in the intracranial vertebral artery with the opposite vertebral artery being occluded, hypoplastic, or severely stenosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In four of the patients, the stenosis was mainly proximal to the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this group, after endarterectomy, the vertebral artery was patent in two patients, and their symptoms resolved; in one patient the endarterectomy occluded, but the patient's symptoms improved; and in one patient the endarterectomy was unsuccessful, and he continued to have symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one patient, the plaque was at the origin of the PICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The operation appeared technically to be successful, but the patient developed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> and died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one patient the stenosis was distal to the PICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During endarterectomy, the plaque was found to invade the posterior wall of the vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The vertebral artery was ligated, and the patient developed a Wallenburg syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of superficial temporal artery to superior cerebellar artery anastomosis are better than those for intracranial vertebral endarterectomy for patients with symptomatic intracranial vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The use of intracranial vertebral endarterectomy should be limited to patients who have disabling symptoms despite medical therapy, a focal lesion proximal to the PICA, and a patent posterior circulation collateral or bypass </plain></SENT>
