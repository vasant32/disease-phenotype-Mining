<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of stent-assisted angioplasty (SAA) for symptomatic intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, and to evaluate preliminarily the significance of classification of location, <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and access (LMA classification) of intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> in SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-two patients with symptomatic intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (diameter reduction: 50% - 74%, n = 15; &gt;or= 75%, n = 27), located in middle cerebral artery (n = 27), intracranial internal carotid artery (n = 4), intracranial vertebral artery (n = 7) and basilar artery (n = 4) respectively, refractory to medical therapy were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LMA classification: 23 of the forty-two lesions (54.8%) located at the site of bifurcation, which were classified according to the location into type A (n = 8), B (n = 11), C (n = 2), D (n = 1) and F (n = 1) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Type A, B and C lesions were 19, 19 and 4 respectively in the light of morphologic classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type I, II and III accesses were 15, 23 and 4 respectively in the light of access classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Technique: The technical successful rate of SAA was 95.2% (40/42) for the group overall, and 100% (15/15), 94.7% (22/23), and 75% (3/4) for type I, II, III accesses, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of periprocedural complication and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 9.5% (4/42), including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusion (n = 1) and high perfusion syndrome (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After emergency measures, 3 patients were cured completely, and the remaining one with severe <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> trunk stenosis of type C lesion died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (2.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During a clinical follow-up period ranging from 1 to 18 months (median 8 months), 39 patients receiving SAA have been still free from ischemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no restenosisfound angiographically 6 months (n = 7) and 12 months (n = 4) after SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that under rigorous control of procedural and periprocedural measures, SAA appears to be a safe and effective therapy for symptomatic intracranial stenoses of type A and B lesions, but it is not risk-free for type C lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The LMA classification is helpful for predicting the results of SAA and to design the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, further study is needed </plain></SENT>
