<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects were nine patients with unilateral obstruction of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The signal ratio (SR16/8) of two images with different TIs (1,600 ms and 800 ms) was calculated, and the cerebral blood flow reserve (CFR) was evaluated by the increase in the ratio of cerebral perfusion after administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> in the SPECT study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A reversed linear correlation ( r=0.75) was found between SR and CFR, indicating that differences of FAIR images with changes of TI will be affected by cerebral flow reserve </plain></SENT>
