<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In rat middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion models with an intraluminal nylon monofilament, lesion volume and its reproducibility vary among laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These variations may be caused by differences in the properties of nylon monofilaments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed the present study to compare the effects of two different types of 4-0 nylon monofilament on neurological and morphological outcomes in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We randomly and blindly used two types of 4-0 nylon monofilament (Ethilon, n = 15, and Nitcho, n = 15) to permanently occlude the ostium of the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> intraluminally in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological outcome and lesion size were compared 24 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diameter, tensile strength, and extensibility of each filament were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neurological outcome was not different between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mortality within 24 hours was 13% (2/15) in the Ethilon group and 0% in the Nitcho group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Total lesion volume in the former was 295.9 +/- 97.2 mm3 (mean +/- SD), significantly larger and more reproducible than that in the latter (190.3 +/- 144.7 mm3, P = .026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Ethilon filament had a significantly larger diameter (Ethilon, 0.193 +/- 0.001 mm; Nitcho, 0.180 +/- 0.001 mm; P &lt; .0001), poorer tensile strength, and better extensibility than the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Exact diameter and quality are not always the same among nylon monofilaments, even if they meet the standard for the designation 4-0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present study indicates that slight differences of filament characteristics significantly affect lesion volume and its reproducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This result may explain some conflicting observations in this <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion model </plain></SENT>
