<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine prospectively the frequency and predictors of recovery of impaired haemodynamics as demonstrated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> (ACZ) reactivity on single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vasoreactivity was measured by (123)I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> SPECT with an ACZ challenge, in 37 medically treated patients with unilateral occlusive disease of the internal carotid or middle cerebral artery at an interval of 1-2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each ACZ challenge test was analysed semiquantitatively by calculating the degree of increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF) asymmetry after ACZ administration (DeltaAI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vasodilatory capacity was abnormal initially in 20 patients (65 %); eight of whom (40 %) exhibited spontaneous normalisation on follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between patients with or without increase in reactivity, logistic regression analysis revealed that the initial DeltaAI (P &lt; 0.05) and the type of vascular lesion (stenosis or occlusion) (P &lt; 0.05) correlated significantly with a return towards <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> of reduced ACZ reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous improvement of impaired vasodilatory capacity may not be a rare phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that mild reduction in the initial ACZ reactivity and a stenosis, but not complete occlusion, were independent factors contributing to normalisation of impaired cerebral haemodynamics </plain></SENT>
