<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Histopathologic analysis of experimental brain damage has traditionally been performed by measuring areas of infarction and/or selective neuronal alterations on a section-by-section basis in individual animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For series containing multiple replicate animals, quantitation of tissue injury is typically performed at similar coronal levels throughout an experimental group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A means of facilitating pictorial group comparisons of these histopathologic alterations between different series of replicate studies is highly desirable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We introduce a newly designed approach to achieve this goal, based on a linear affine transformation that is used to map corresponding sections at the same anatomic level into a common template to yield a frequency distribution map depicting the aggregate data set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have applied this approach to compare the histopathologic features of two models of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion in rats: (1) photothrombotically induced permanent distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and (2) temporary <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion by intraluminal suture in Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The brains of SHR rats with permanent distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion showed a high frequency of infarction involving the dorsolateral and lateral portions of the ipsilateral neocortex, whereas Wistar rats with 90-minute <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> suture occlusion showed a zone of infarction largely concentrated in the dorsolateral portion of the ipsilateral caudoputamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> frequency distributions for the two animal groups were compared statistically at three corresponding anatomic levels by Fisher's exact test; the resulting statistical parametric maps are shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: With the use of frequency distribution maps, the pattern of trends within a group can be observed coronally or three-dimensionally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One can directly access data as to numbers of rats with infarction for any point on the map </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Studies performed under different experimental conditions can also be compared with one another by means of the generated data sets </plain></SENT>
