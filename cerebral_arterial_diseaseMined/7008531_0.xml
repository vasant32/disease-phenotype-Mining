<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors present one case of a 42 years old male patient who had a small right paraventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At operation the patient was placed in the Talairach's stereotactic frame and, after performing a right carotid angiogram to locate the lesion exactly, a flexible cannula was inserted stereotactically, through a previous trephine hole, until the tip reached the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a microsurgical technique and through a 1-2 cm corticotomy the cannula pathway was followed easily reaching the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total removal of the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> was confirmed by a carotid angiogram, the patient was discharged without symptoms 7 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors propose that due to the special design of the Talairach's stereotactic frame, its application as a locating system for small and deep <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>'s would greatly facilitate their removal using microsurgical techniques </plain></SENT>
