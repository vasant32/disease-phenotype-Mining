<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study reports the case of a 42-year-old man who suffered a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the anterior communicating artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>His memory capabilities were assessed after a considerable recovery period during which many of his <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e> ameliorated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>His scan revealed a left frontal lesion and many of his deficits were characteristic of frontal impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He was impaired on temporal discrimination, and he showed marked source forgetting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He also performed badly on the Brown-Peterson task, and we suggest that this is another task that may be characteristic of frontal impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the patient showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> performance on some memory tasks but not on others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the patient's frontal signs are similar to those found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0349464" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Korsakoff's Syndrome</z:e>, but that his <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> is qualitatively different from that encountered in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002625" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
