<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 53-year-old male complained of frequent left motor-sensory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> for 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On admission, he demonstrated mild right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo>, and right hemisensory disturbance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography demonstrated complete occlusion of the left internal carotid artery just above the origin of the ophthalmic artery and a stenotic lesion at the horizontal segment of the right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Renal angiography showed severe stenosis of the right renal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systolic blood pressure was over 200 mmHg and marked circadian variation of blood pressure was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum renin was 4.0 ng/ml/hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four months after superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis, left carotid angiography showed good patency of the bypass and the ischemic symptoms completely disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed increased cerebral blood flow (CBF), especially in the left hemisphere after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six months after the bypass surgery, he complained of mild right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> again </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Shortly after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) for renal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo>, his <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> was improved and the systolic blood pressure stabilized to 150-170 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SPECT showed the CBF had also recovered in both hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The improvement in ischemic symptoms and increased CBF after <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> were probably related to stabilization of the systemic blood pressure or inhibition of serum renin-angiotensin </plain></SENT>
