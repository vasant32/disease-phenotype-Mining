<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is established that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> causes various systemic micro- and macro-vascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little has been, however, studied on the differential effects of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on the large artery diseases (LAD) or small artery disease (SAD) in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine an association of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on the incidence of underlying LAD versus SAD in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively collected 523 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients without cardioembolic causes or other determined causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using brain MRI, the cerebral LAD (extracranial and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> of 50 % or more) and the cerebral SAD (old <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e>, microbleeds and leukoaraiosis) findings were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Information regarding vascular risk factor was also collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the patients (male, n = 342; <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, n = 200), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was not associated with the presence of LADs or SADs in female subjects, but strongly with the presence of intracranial LAD in male subjects (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association remained significant (OR 2.09, 95 %CI 1.25-3.51) after adjusting for major confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A similar association was also found in intracranial LAD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was, however, no significant association of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with SAD in male nor in female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with the frequency of intracranial LAD, especially in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Out study may be regarded as evidence of differential biological effects of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on cerebral vasculature </plain></SENT>
