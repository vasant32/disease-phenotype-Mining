<SENT sid="1" pm="?"><plain>When a post-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurs, the question is: is it a brain protection failure, a technical fault or an ill-advised indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, apart from massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, other significant disorders may occur especially affecting higher functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied a series of 126 patients with a mean age of 68.4 years who underwent 140 carotid repairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average clamping time was 21.8 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain protection always consisted of: general anesthesia and heparinization, hyperoxygenation, light <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> without shunting or monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> (2.1%) were due to an incorrect indication or technical error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three resolving neurological events were related to clamping intolerance (2.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>What appears to be responsible, in case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, is not so much clamping but technical errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also observed disturbances of higher functions in 25 patients (17.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A study using psychometric tests performed preoperatively and at a convenient time from the operation is proposed in order to demonstrate carotid clamping effects on higher functions </plain></SENT>
