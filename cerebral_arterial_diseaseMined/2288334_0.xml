<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first step still is to recognise SAH, so that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> misleading clinical aspects of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture do not misguide, or even fail to do the right diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If so, rebleeding still remains a real danger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among biological patterns, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>hyponatremia</z:hpo> is an important factor of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular symptoms are represented by a sudden and transient arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> which can drive to a diagnostic error and electrocardiographic abnormalities, which are directly related with the degree of vasospasm; their evolution is completely regressive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Main intracranial consequences are early <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, worsening of consciousness and progressive ventricular distension on CT scan and vasospasm, which occurs between the 4th and the 12th day, may be asymptomatic or symptomatic, responsive for delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, followed by deterioration of consciousness and focal neurological signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The main factors responsible for the vasospasm are a high amount of blood in basal cisterns on CT scan; an increase of substances released by the lysis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> in CSF; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>hyponatremia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011106'>hypovolemia</z:hpo>, and decrease in cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consequences of these disorders have to be well known in the medical treatment before and after operation </plain></SENT>
