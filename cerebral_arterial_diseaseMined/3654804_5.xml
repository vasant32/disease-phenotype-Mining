<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These variables were measured in 11 cats after a sham operation, in five after a 1-h occlusion, in two after a 2-h occlusion, in five after a 4-h occlusion, and in four after a 16-h occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The time course of the cerebral tissue radioactivity [Ci* (t)] was monitored by external coincidence counting during a programmed infusion of [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>]2-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arterial plasma concentration [Cp* (t)] of tracer was kept constant during the first 45 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparison of k2* and k3* in the sham-operated group, estimated by external coincidence counting, and by the ratio of extraction fractions of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>]2-FDG, demonstrated no significant difference between these rate constants in these two groups of animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate and lumped constants were also estimated from Ci* (t) and Cp* (t), as well as from the ratio of extraction fractions of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>]2-FDG, respectively, in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant decrease in k3* was observed after 1 h of occlusion (20% lower than in the sham operation, p less than 0.05); in k1* decrease occurred within 4 h of occlusion (21% lower than in the sham operation, p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, decrease in k2* was observed only after 16 h of occlusion (26% lower than in the sham operation, p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Namely, decrease of rate constants occurred first in k3* then in k1* and k2*.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
