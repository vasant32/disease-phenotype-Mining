<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the come up of Computerized Tomography (CT) which often is done without the strong indications as postulated for the conventional neuroradiologic examinations, asymptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> in the elderly population may be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since May 1977 4 asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> were diagnosed in our institution using CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2 of these patients had severe degenerative changes of the great cerebral vessels and an unusual collateral circulation developed probably because of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0853404" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">steal-phenomenon</z:e> in the vascular malformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These 2 cases allow to study <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> possibilities of cerebral collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Uncommon in one of the cases was a capillary anastomotic network through the thalami, in the other case an extensive dural rete mirabile developed </plain></SENT>
