<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Various clinical subtypes of patients presenting with sudden-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> have been recognized, but classification of those types is not simple </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified various patterns of perfusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiographic findings in hyperacute <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> with relation to clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve patients with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> due to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> underwent perfusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography within 6 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Perfusion-weighted imaging was performed with a conventional dynamic contrast-enhanced T2*-weighted sequence, and cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps were then created </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CBV maps and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiographic findings were compared with 99mTc-HMPAO brain SPECT scans, short-term outcomes, and follow-up imaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The combined CBV and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiographic findings were classified into three patterns: <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> and decreased CBV (n = 8), <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> and increased CBV (n = 2), and no <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CBV (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These three patterns were strongly related to SPECT findings, short-term outcomes, and follow-up imaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Perfusion on SPECT decreased markedly in the affected regions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with the first pattern, decreased slightly in the second pattern, and was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the third pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Symptoms were not significantly changed at 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in any of the patients with the first pattern, but resolved completely in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with the latter two patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up imaging showed large infarctions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with the first pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Initially, no infarction was seen in the second pattern, but watershed infarction developed later in one of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hyperacute <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> may be differentiated into three imaging patterns with different clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The combined use of perfusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography may play a substantial role in guiding the choice of treatment of this disease </plain></SENT>
