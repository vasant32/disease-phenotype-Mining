<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four polymorphisms in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor (GR) gene have been reported to alter <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> sensitivity and have been associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies on the relationship between these GR variants and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) risk, however, have yielded conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether haplotypes based on functional polymorphisms in the GR gene influenced susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> in a high-risk population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a multicenter cohort study, 1830 patients with heterozygous familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> were genotyped for the functional ER22/23EK, N363S, BclI, and 9beta variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the combined effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> GR variants by constructing haplotypes and using a Cox proportional hazards regression model with adjustment for year of birth and smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The analyses were stratified for sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> defined as coronary, cerebral, and peripheral artery disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 359 men (40.8%) and 224 women (23.6%) had a cardiovascular event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In men, the BclI haplotype was associated with a 34% higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk (confidence interval 1.02-1.76; P = 0.03) and the 9beta haplotype with a 41% higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk (confidence interval 1.02-1.94; P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In women, none of the GR haplotypes was significantly related with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We did not find differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> between GR haplotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of high-risk individuals, two common haplotypes in the GR gene modified <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> susceptibility among men </plain></SENT>
