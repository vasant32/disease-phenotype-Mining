<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the diagnostic implications of the recurrence pattern after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 210 consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonographic (US), neuroimaging and cardiologic data were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 90 day follow-up, 14 patients (6.7%; 95% CI: 3.3-10.1) among 209 suffered an ischemic infarction (II), 9 (4.3%; 1.5-7.1) a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and 6 (2.9%; 0.6-5.1) a cardiac ischemic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 13 patients (6.2%; 2.8-9.6) among 210 with a seven-day follow-up had an II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses only identified the presence of intracranial stenoses (HR, 23.29; 95% CI, 3.49 to 23.57; p&lt;0.018) as independent predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> within the first 7 days, and large-artery occlusive disease (HR, 9.07; CI, 3.49 to 23.57; p&lt;0.001) as a predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence at 90 day follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A new diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was observed in 21 subjects (10.0%), and it was documented in the baseline ECG in 62% cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> diffusion abnormalities were identified in 81 (44,5%) of 182 patients, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ischemic lesions were observed in 110 (60.4%) on MRI vs 56 (26.7%) among 210 on CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Due to very early recurrence, the routine use of ultrasonography within the first hours after an index <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> will be useful to identify those patients at high risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prognostic usefulness of diffusion-weighted studies will be only achieved if it is performed early </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Routine noninvasive cardiac rhythm monitoring has a low detection rate </plain></SENT>
