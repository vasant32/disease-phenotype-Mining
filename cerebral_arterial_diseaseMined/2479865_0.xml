<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) is not commonly applied to the carotid artery because of the risk of cerebral embolization and the uncertainty concerning the long-term results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test its effectiveness and safety, the author performed <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> in dogs with experimentally induced carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under general anesthesia, one carotid artery was exposed by midline incision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two vascular tourniquets were applied to the artery, 2 to 5 cm apart, and the blood between them was replaced with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> for 5 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The drug was then removed and the tourniquets released </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiography revealed the formation of stenotic lesions within 1 to 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histological examination showed the source of stenosis to be <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> adhering to the vessel wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> was performed 1 week or 3 to 6 weeks after induction of stenosis using either Gr√ºntzig or Dotter catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immediately after <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>, considerable enlargement of stenotic areas was angiographically observed, and no emboli were detected in distal arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histological findings included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depressions</z:hpo> in the intima, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, and stretching of the internal elastic membrane and tunica media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Angiograms obtained 3 and 6 months after <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> disclosed persistence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the carotid lumen and diminution of the inner surface irregularities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six months after <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>, the histological features included intimal proliferation and rarefaction of the tunica media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, stenotic arteries not subjected to <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> were totally occluded by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> and intimal proliferation 6 months after induction of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is apparent that <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> was effective not only in bringing about <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the carotid artery but also in arresting the progression of stenosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
