<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Transcranial Doppler sonography is useful for the diagnosis of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the previous studies have focused on the elevated mean flow velocity (MFV) or asymmetry of MFV, the lack of clinical correlation might limit diagnostic accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We try to develop and validate a new diagnostic model including more comprehensive clinical and sonographic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)-verified <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis were included, and compared with control subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The age, sex, corresponding symptoms (CS) to sonographic side, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were included for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As sonographic parameters, MFV (cm/<z:chebi fb="63" ids="30000">sec</z:chebi>), asymmetry index (AI,%), and difference of pulsatility index (DeltaPI) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical-sonographic index (CSI) model was built with significant parameters by multivariate logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and seven patients (M:F = 53:54, age: 61.6 +/- 11.6 years), and 100 control subjects (M:F = 49:51, age: 54.9 +/- 14.5 years) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In logistic regression, MFV (odds ratio [OR], 1.057; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.030-1.084), AI (OR, 1.067; 95% CI, 1.031-1.104), DeltaPI (OR, 41.754; 95% CI, 2.771-626.999), CS (OR, 15.904; 95% CI, 5.055-50.042), and DM (OR, 3.949; 95% CI, 1.132-13.783) were independent predictors of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CSI was simplified for clinical use, CSI = MFV(cm/<z:chebi fb="63" ids="30000">sec</z:chebi>) + 3 * AI (%) + 180 *DeltaPI + 90 * CS(presence = 1, absence = 0) + 30 * DM (presence = 1, absence = 0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis versus MFV, DeltaPI, AI, and CSI was .641, .668, .865 and .953 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>According to ROC curve, cut-off point for <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis was suggested as CSI &gt; 180 (sensitivity: 87%, specificity: 92%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CSI might be useful to enhance diagnostic accuracy </plain></SENT>
