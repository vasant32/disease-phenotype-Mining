<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four groups of eight rats each underwent microsurgical MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two groups were treated with a PEMF generator for 2 h following the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and were sacrificed at 4 and 24 h following the MCAo respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The other two groups were also sacrificed at the same time intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regional brain <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>, and calcium tissue contents were determined by atomic spectrophotometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As distinct from results found in spinal cord <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp>, no significant difference between the PEMF-treated groups and the non-treatment groups was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PEMF treatment did not alter the 300% rise in calcium tissue dry weight content observed at 24 h following MCAo in the infarcted tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regional brain water content was determined by the dry weight method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A regionally inconsistent reduction in brain water content was noted in the PEMF-treated rats </plain></SENT>
