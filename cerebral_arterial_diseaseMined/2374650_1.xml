<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report two cases of asymptomatic occlusion of the main trunk of the cerebral artery associated with subcortical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in the area fed by collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first patient, a 51-year-old female who had suffered from untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> for 20 years, was hospitalized in a state of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography (CT) revealed a subcortical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in the right parietal lobe as well as subdural and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhages</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography disclosed occlusion of the right internal carotid artery at its origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The region normally supplied by the right anterior (ACA) and middle cerebral (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) arteries was supplied instead by the posterior cerebral artery via leptomeningeal anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> was removed and the patient was discharged 1 month later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second patient was a 54-year-old female who had suffered from uncontrollable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> for 27 years and was hospitalized after sudden development of stupor, right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002427'>motor aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CT demonstrated a subcortical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in the left parietal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography disclosed occlusion of the left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> at its origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The area normally fed by the left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was supplied instead by the ACA by way of leptomeningeal anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One month after operation the patient was transferred to another hospital for rehabilitation of right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both of these middle-aged women had long-standing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> were thought to result from rupture of the leptomeningeal anastomosis, which had developed as collateral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is probable that the relatively weak leptomeningeal anastomosis could no longer withstand the increased blood flow brought on by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
