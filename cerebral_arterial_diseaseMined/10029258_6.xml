<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A retrospective review of conventional cerebral angiograms of 46 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comparison was made with findings on magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography where available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six children (78%) underwent magnetic resonance angiography in addition to conventional cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebral angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance angiography was diagnostic in 25 of 28 patients with large vessel occlusion, stenosis, or moya-moya syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conventional angiography was abnormal in four of nine patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conventional angiograms also had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> magnetic resonance angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conventional angiography, either diagnostic or yielding further information, altered management in five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo>, one patient with large vessel occlusion, one patient with large vessel stenosis, and four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the basis of this experience, a clinical algorithm for the use of conventional cerebral angiography in the investigation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in children is proposed </plain></SENT>
