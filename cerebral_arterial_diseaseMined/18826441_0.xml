<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Comparison was performed between unilateral and bilateral power M-mode transcranial Doppler to detect right-to-left circulatory shunt (RLS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Recorded Doppler data from 87 patients with confirmed RLS referred for transcatheter closure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> were reanalyzed for embolic tracks (ET) counted from left and right temporal bone windows during bubble study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unilateral counts were obtained by multiplying each side by 2; bilateral counts were obtained by summing left and right ET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both unilateral and bilateral ET were converted to a 6-point logarithmic grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sex and age group subanalyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At rest, significantly more ET were detected with bilateral versus unilateral detection (P= .01), but not following Valsalva (P= .13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unilateral and bilateral detection were equally able to detect large RLS (grades IV or V) following Valsalva (P= 1.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the group aged &gt; or =55 years, the right-hand side yielded greater ET than the left-hand side (mean difference 9%+/- 37; 95% confidence interval -3 to 21%) at rest (P= .01), but not following Valsalva (mean difference 1%+/- 25; 95% confidence interval -7 to 9%, P= .10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral detection of ET by power M-mode transcranial Doppler is equivalent to bilateral detection to assess RLS </plain></SENT>
