<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stenoses of the great craniocervical vessels were found in 11 patients (28.9%), but there was not a single case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A correlation between the localization of the stenosis, the localization of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and the presumed region of the transient cerebral function disturbance was found only in a few patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Concerning the morphological changes of the small intracranial arterial branches, there was hardly any difference between clinically affected and non-affected territories of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The angiograms of the 38 cases of complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> were compared with the angiograms of 40 patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in the young and those of 49 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were remarkably fewer stenoses or occlusions in the great craniocervical arteries of patients suffering from complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> (28.9%) than in the vessels of cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the young (52.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the incidence was comparable with the results in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> (34.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The degree of morphological changes in the small intracranial arterial branches is likely to depend primarily on the patient's age and less on the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that in almost 30% of patients with complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>-even at juvenile age-stenoses of the great craniocervical vessels might be found.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
