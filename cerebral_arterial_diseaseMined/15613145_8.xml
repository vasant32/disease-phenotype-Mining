<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-nine patients with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, six patients with venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (confirmed by computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> were selected for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine subjects with no past history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MTHFR genotypes were determined by PCR using specific primers, followed by restriction digestion and gel analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of the mutated homozygous and heterozygous C677T MTHFR genotype in the patients with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 1.4% (one of 69) and 31.88% (21 of 69), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There frequency was 16.6% (one of six) and 33.3% (two of six) in venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The genotyping results from controls showed that there was only one heterozygote out of the 49 studied (2.08%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference between the control and the patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Odds ratio for the probability of the C677T MTHFR gene mutation in the patients versus control group was 22.29 (95% CI 4.89-98.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This indicates that C677T MTHFR mutation is strongly associated with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> especially in young adults </plain></SENT>
