<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether abnormalities of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> are present in very young children with sickle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-nine children with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> SS between the ages of 7 and 48 months were examined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No child had a history of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, although 3 had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (2 neonatal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients underwent developmental testing with the Bayley or McCarthy Scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall prevalence of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> abnormalities in asymptomatic children was 4 of 36 (11%, confidence interval 3, 26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient had a silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> observed on MRI and a stenotic lesion on MRA; 3 other patients had stenotic lesions on MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 3 patients who had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had lesions consistent with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the asymptomatic patients who had psychometric testing, 1 of 18 was developmentally delayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One of 3 with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> had mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Very young children with sickle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (and no history of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) have infarction in the brain and/or stenosis of major cerebral arteries, similar to those reported in older children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate a need for larger studies to define the incidence of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> lesions in this age group and to determine the need for early therapeutic intervention to prevent <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> sequelae of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
