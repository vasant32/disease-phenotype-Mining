<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results show that by placing a 0.4 mm needle through the intracranial internal carotid artery and percutaneously removing it the following day, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is regularly present five days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There has been no mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of two monkeys followed with serial angiograms suggest that spasm first appears four days following the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and lasts at least eleven days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> experiments show that the most affected vessel in each experiment is reduced to 62% of control diameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm involves cerebral arteries both ipsilateral and contralateral to the site of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and extends to the most distal vessels which can be measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, a neurological defect has been regularly demonstrated on the side contralateral to the site of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
