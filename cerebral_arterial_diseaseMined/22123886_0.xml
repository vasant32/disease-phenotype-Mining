<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Neonatal arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (AIS) has emerged as a leading cause of perinatal brain injury, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo>, and lifelong disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis is poorly understood, which limits the development of treatment and prevention strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multicenter studies must define epidemiology, risk factors, treatment practices, and outcomes to advance clinical trials and improve the adverse outcomes suffered by most survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The International Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Study is a global research initiative of 149 coinvestigators (30 centers in 10 countries) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with clinical and neuroimaging confirmation of symptomatic neonatal AIS were enrolled (2003-2007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Standardized, Web-based data entry collected clinical presentations, risk factors, investigations, treatments, and early outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We examined predictors of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> characteristics and discharge outcome by using multivariate logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred forty-eight neonates were studied (57% male, 10% premature) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most of them presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> (72%) and nonfocal neurologic signs (63%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MRI was completed for 92% of the infants, although &lt;50% had vascular imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> preferentially involved the anterior circulation and left hemisphere and were multifocal in 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Maternal health and pregnancies were usually <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Neonates often required resuscitation (30%) and had systemic illnesses (23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Cardiac and prothrombotic abnormalities were identified in &lt;20% of the infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Antithrombotic treatment was uncommon (21%) and varied internationally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Half (49%) of the infants had deficits at discharge, and data on their long-term outcomes are pending </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Newborns with AIS are often systemically sick, whereas their mothers are usually healthy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Definitive causes for most neonatal AISs have not been established, and large-scale case-control studies are required to understand pathogenesis if outcomes are to be improved </plain></SENT>
