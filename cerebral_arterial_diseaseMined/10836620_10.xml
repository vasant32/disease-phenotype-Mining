<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is important to distinguish these from pure <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> resulting from small-vessel disease because the investigations and examinations differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the differences on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) between small subcortical "lacunar-like" <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> resulting from large-vessel disease and pure lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirteen subjects with small lacunar-like <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (size &lt; 2 cm), resulting from large-vessel disease, and 30 subjects with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (&lt; 2 cm), without large-vessel disease were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We measured infarction size using a 1.5-T MRI device and evaluated silent subcortical hyperintensity lesions using the modified Scheltens' score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Large-vessel lesion was confirmed by conventional angiography, duplex carotid scan, and magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the mean age of the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular risk factors and atherosclerotic complications were also comparable for the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was more common in the lacunar-like infarction group than in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> group (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Scores for periventricular hyperintensity, white matter hyperintensity, basal ganglia hyperintensity, and total subcortical hyperintensity scores were significantly higher in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> group than in the lacunar-like infarction group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The difference in basal ganglia hyperintensity scores was remarkable (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The enlargement of the perivascular space was also significantly greater in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> group than in the lacunar-like infarction group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings seem to reflect differences in the pathogenesis of infarction between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Silent subcortical hyperintensity lesions and enlargement of perivascular space are useful for between distinguishing small lacunar-like <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> resulting from large-vessel disease and pure <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This may have significant implications for the management of patients with lacunar-sized infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It suggests that the pathogenesis of lacunar-sized infarction is variable </plain></SENT>
