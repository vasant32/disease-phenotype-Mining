<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pathologically the disorder is characterized by multiple, solitary or continuous foci of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> or softening), varying in size and stage, predominantly involving the bilateral cerebral cortices and to a lesser degree cerebral white matter, basal ganglia, brainstem and cereblum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the lesions does not correspond to vascular territories, suggesting that they are not due to usual thrombotic or embolic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The exact nature and pathogenesis of these lesions with characteristic distribution pattern remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied systematically cerebral blood vessels from two autopsied patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MELAS</z:e> by electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the main cerebral arteries including anterior, middle and posterior cerebral, basilar and vertebral arteries were examined at their proximal portions at the cerebral base and at their peripheral portions at the cortical surface as well as within brain parenchyma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found marked accumulation of mitochondria in the cell bodies of smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells and numerous smooth muscle cells showing degeneration or <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, sporadically or in clusters in the tunica media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities were most prominent in the walls of pial arterioles and small arteries up to 250 mu in diameter, and less frequent and severe in the larger pial arteries and intracerebral arterioles and small arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These vascular changes are different from any of those described in various disorders known to involve the cerebral blood vessels and are thus characteristic to the cerebral blood vessels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MELAS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We think that these peculiar vascular changes called <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> are caused by primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction in the vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells themselves, as is the same in the skeletal and cardiac muscles in this disease, and that they constitute the pathogenic base of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> with unusual distribution pattern and nature in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MELAS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
