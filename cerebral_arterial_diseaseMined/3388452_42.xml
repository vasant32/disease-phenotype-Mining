<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mean time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms to start of infusion and mean dosage of urokinase were 4.5 hours and 927,000 units, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immediate recanalization was achieved in 10 patients (45%) after urokinase therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with successful recanalization, rapid amelioration of symptoms followed the restoration of blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thrombolytic recanalization was associated with reduction of neurologic deficits and of computed tomography-demonstrable infarction volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reduction of infarction volume and functional outcome correlated highly with the degree of reflow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic transformation of infarction occurred in four patients and controllable extracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in three patients </plain></SENT>
