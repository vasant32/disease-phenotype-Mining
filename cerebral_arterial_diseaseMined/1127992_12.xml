<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No filling impairment was detected with 90 minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and only slight impairment was detected with 3 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Severe microcirculatory obstruction was found after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> longer than 3 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The obstruction appeared to be at the capillary level and seemed partly the result of narrowing of cappillary channels by perivascular glial swelling and developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the developing microcirculatory obstruction and the distribution and severity of the neuronal alterations was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of this investigation using the same experimental model suggest that obstruction of parenchymal vessels does not play a major role in the production of an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in areas of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
