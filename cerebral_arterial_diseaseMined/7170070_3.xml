<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Now we present an autopsy case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 53-year-old female was admitted to our hospital on May, 22, 1978, two hours after an apparent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002329'>drowsiness</z:hpo>, nuchal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002427'>motor aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Left carotid angiogram showed an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery at its origin with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011834'>moyamoya phenomenon</z:hpo>, but did not demonstrate an occlusion and/or stenosis of the intracranial internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore right carotid and bilateral vertebral angiograms were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The hospital course was progressively uphill, and she did not have any focal neurological deficits at discharge </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that the stenotic arterial wall of the left middle cerebral artery might be a congenital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
