<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have studied patients with bilateral SCA infarctions to provide data on clinical findings, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> distribution and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We collected data of 8 patients with bilateral SCA infarctions recognized by computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common clinical presentation of patients with bilateral SCA infarctions were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> (6 patients), often associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> (5 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further symptoms were variable and depended on additional <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in other vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> were often partial or scattered with equal distribution between the medial and lateral branches of the SCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete infarction within the SCA area occurred in less than half of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome was either benign (full recovery in 3 patients) or fatal (5 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Predictors for a good clinical recovery were young age, few vascular risk factors, only partial involvement of the SCA territory without involvement of other vascular territories, and absent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003690'>limb weakness</z:hpo> on clinical presentation </plain></SENT>
