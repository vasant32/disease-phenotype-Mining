<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, quantitation of injured brain cells and inflammatory cells after MCAo has not been determined in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transient (2 h) MCAo was therefore induced in male Wistar rats by means of an intraluminal monofilament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical and histochemical procedures performed at 46 h after MCAo were used to identify specific cellular populations in ischemic and control rats (n = 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic core of the lesion, approximately 24.7% of cells disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-four point eight percent of parenchymal cells consisted of intact (13.0%) or reversibly injured swollen (7.6%) and scalloped/shrunken dark (24.2%) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of irreversibly damaged cells was 55.2%, and included 49.9% necrotic cells (10.5% red and 39.4% ghost) and 5.4% apoptotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the inner boundary zone of the lesion, 15.9% of cells disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Viable cells constituted 62.0% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> remaining cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neutrophils and macrophages were localized to this area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the outer boundary zone of the lesion, 9.0% of cells disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Viable cells constituted 91.6% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> remaining cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The ratio of apoptotic to necrotic cells was 1:9, 1:6, 1:13 in the ischemic core, inner and outer boundary zones, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest the presence of three zones within the ischemic lesion: the core, and inner and outer boundaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At 46 h after 2 h of MCAo the ischemic lesion is highly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> containing relatively large percentages of morphologically intact cells, suggesting the possibility of an extended window of therapeutic opportunity </plain></SENT>
