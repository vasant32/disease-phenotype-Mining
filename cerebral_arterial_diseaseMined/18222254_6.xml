<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of intracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral artery disease</z:e> is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to determine whether a therapeutic strategy based on perioperative detection of intracranial and extracranial occlusive cerebrovascular disease and atheromatous aorta could reduce perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 485 patients who underwent isolated CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The control group was 247 patients who underwent standard-protocol CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 238 subjects in the intervention group underwent preoperative magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck and intraoperative epiaortic scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral hemodynamics were evaluated by single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> tests in patients with significant occlusive cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgical outcomes were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the intervention group, magnetic resonance angiography detected significant intracranial or extracranial occlusive cerebrovascular disease, or both, in 40 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic cerebrovascular interventions were performed in 7 patients who had disturbed cerebral hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Aorta no-touch off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) was chosen intraoperatively in 37 patients with moderate to severe atheromatous aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was 0.42% in the intervention group vs 2.8% in the control group (p = .068) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis revealed that the perioperative interventional protocol was the most powerful predictor of reduced risk of perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (odds ratio, 0.023; 95% confidence interval, 0.001 to 0.469) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic cerebrovascular interventions and the selective use of aorta no-touch OPCAB can significantly reduce the incidence of perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Careful vascular evaluation before and during CABG can improve surgical outcomes </plain></SENT>
