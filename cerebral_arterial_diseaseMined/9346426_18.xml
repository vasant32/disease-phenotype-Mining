<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The unaffected side of 37 studies with unilateral vascular lesions and 45 studies without apparent vascular lesions showed 132 +/- 17% and 140 +/- 15% increase of mean CBF (mCBF), respectively, under Acz administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparing these values, the Acz-activated rCBF increases of less-affected and affected hemispheres of 23 studies with bilateral vascular lesions (116 +/- 13% and 113 +/- 12%, respectively) was lower with high statistical significance (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
