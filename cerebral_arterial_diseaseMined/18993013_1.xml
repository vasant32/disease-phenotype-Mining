<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Occasionally divers will suffer an injury from barotrauma, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011119" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">decompression sickness</z:e> or an arterial gas embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The history and physical examination are important when determining the etiology of the injury and its subsequent treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This article will help readers identify key components of the history and physical examination in a patient to help differentiate between and injury caused by barotrauma or arterial gas embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: This is a case of a diver that was initially felt to have an arterial gas embolism after scuba diving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After obtaining further history and performing a detailed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065,C0031809" disease_type="Health Care Activity;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">physical exam</z:e> it was determined that his <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> was due to barotrauma from his mask </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was confirmed by an orbital computed tomography (CT) scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: Scuba diving is a very safe sport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When injuries occur it is important to obtain a careful history and physical examination to determine the exact cause of the injury because treatments vary according to the type of injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this case, the history and physical examination showed that the only neurologic sign the patient had was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo>, which is not consistent with a diagnosis of arterial gas embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The CT scan helped with the diagnosis because it proved the patient had an orbital <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> causing his <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>proptosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>double vision</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
