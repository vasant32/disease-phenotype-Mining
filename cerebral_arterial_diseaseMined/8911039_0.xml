<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> over 75% to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">complete obstruction</z:e> were categorized as the significant stenosis group and the others as the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> findings group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 89 cases, 19 (21.1%) showed significant stenosis, among which six patients were found to have complete occlusion of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (7.9%) developed postoperative neurological complications, with four patients having single or plural significant stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiograms of three of those four patients revealed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">complete obstruction</z:e> of their internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The stenotic group showed a tendency toward neurological complications in comparison with the non-stenotic group although the incidence was not significant (p = 0.054) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However analysis of the group with complete occlusion of the internal carotid artery indicated significant increased risk for cerebral complication (p &lt; 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Besides the 89 patients studied, an additional 479 patients who had not undergone preoperative angiography were subjected to this study whether the patient's age, previous history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and extracorporeal circulation (ECC) time or aortic cross-clamp time were of the risk factors for postoperative cerebral complications or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was significant correlation between age (p = 0.044) and/or the previous history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> (p &lt; 0.001) and neurological complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although there was no correlation between either the duration of ECC or aortic cross-clamp time and neurological problems within the whole study population, when only the patients over 70 years old and/or having history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> were studied, an increased tendency towards neurological complications was seen when the ECC time was longer than 120 minutes (p = 0.045) </plain></SENT>
