<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our previous studies show that long-term <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> treatment augments vascular tone under physiological conditions and exacerbates endotoxin-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> can be metabolized by aromatase to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>, evoking a balance between androgenic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">estrogenic effects</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the effect of the nonaromatizable <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16330">dihydrotestosterone</z:chebi> (DHT), on the inflammatory nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB) pathway in cerebral blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral arteries were isolated from orchiectomized male rats treated chronically with DHT in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, pial arteries were isolated from orchiectomized males and were exposed ex vivo to DHT or vehicle in culture medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DHT treatment, in vivo or ex vivo, increased nuclear NFkappaB activation in cerebral arteries and increased levels of the proinflammatory products of NFkappaB activation, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Effects of DHT on COX-2 and iNOS were attenuated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5132">flutamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In isolated pressurized middle cerebral arteries from DHT-treated rats, constrictions to the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS398 or the selective iNOS inhibitor L-nil, [L-N6-(Iminoethyl)lysine], were increased, confirming a functional consequence of DHT exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, activation of the NFkappaB-mediated COX-2/iNOS pathway by the selective <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, DHT, results in a state of <z:mp ids='MP_0001863'>vascular inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This effect may contribute to sex-related differences in cerebrovascular pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
