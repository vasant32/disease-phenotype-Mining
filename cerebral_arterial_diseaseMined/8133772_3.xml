<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> anesthesia, the right eye was enucleated, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> dissected and a suture looped around the vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A short segment of thicker suture was set horizontally on the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The looped suture was then tied and the segment suture removed, resulting in partial stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The knot could be easily removed, restoring blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Perfusion and diffusion-sensitive magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) images were obtained over the next 6 hours to document cerebral blood flow abnormalities and developing ischemic changes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Laser-Doppler was performed to further document reduced flow through the ipsilateral hemisphere following <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histopathologic sections were assessed for ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results show this to be a reliable model of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis and reperfusion, which is suitable for the evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral perfusion abnormalities resulting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
