<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery was occluded distal to the striatal branches in male spontaneously hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 7, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 min; 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 h and 7 days later the animals were sacrificed and the brains were stained for zinc-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15138">sulfides</z:chebi>, cell bodies and AChE-positive cholinergic fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The density of zinc positive terminals significantly decreased in the neocortical ischemic zone 7 min after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the neocortical layers II and III most zinc positive neuronal terminals disappeared at 7 min after MCAO whereas the zinc positive terminals in layers V and VI remained positive at least 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Beginning at 1 h after MCAO and progressing to 24 h a significant decrease in the density of zinc positive terminals was observed in the dorsolateral striatum, and ventrobasal thalamic nucleus, both major projection areas of the sensorimotor cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The disappearance of zinc positive neuronal terminals in the ischemic neocortex and related areas, is most likely due to a neuronal release of vesicular zinc in response to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The high extracellular concentration of zinc is thought to be both neuroprotective by blocking the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor and neurotoxic by activating neuronal influx of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> through voltage gated calcium channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It seems evident that the latter effect of zinc is contributing to the neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
