<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In 13 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> in patients with carotid or middle cerebral artery occlusive disease, the HUT test was used to determine whether or not the symptoms appear during induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> before investigating cerebral hemodynamics with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three of the 13 patients showed focal symptoms such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and limb <z:mp ids='MP_0000745'>shaking</z:mp> during the HUT test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 patients, the oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) increased beyond 53.3% (ie, misery perfusion), whereas only 2 of the other 10 patients without focal symptoms showed an increase in OEF during HUT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The HUT test was highly useful for screening patients with cerebral hemodynamic insufficiency in carotid occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
