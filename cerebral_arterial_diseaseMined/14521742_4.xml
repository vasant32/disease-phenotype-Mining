<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-eight patients with symptomatic intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> were treated by transluminal stent-assistant angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of them, 40 cases were selected because they had recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> or mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> despite of antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy; 8 cases with high-grade stenosis after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral artery theromblysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lesions involved <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (17/48); Basilar artery (8/48); intracranial vertebral artery (18/18); and distal ICA (5/18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For 46 of 48 cases the flexible coronary stent were successfully deployed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average stenosis reduced from 83% to 5%, short-term follow-up showed good clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complications include vessel rupture (1/18); <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> within stent (1/48); <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> of cortical artery (1/18) and perforate vessel occlusion (1/18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Stent-assistant angioplasty are effective for treatment of symptomatic intracranial stenosis, the higher rate of complications may be because of the limited experiences of this technique. it need further practise and long term follow-up study </plain></SENT>
