<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Interleukin-1 beta is a proinflammatory cytokine produced by blood-borne and resident brain inflammatory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to determine if interleukin-1 beta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was produced in the brain of rats subjected to permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rat interleukin-1 beta cDNA, synthesized from stimulated rat peritoneal macrophage <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction and cloned in plasmid Bluescript KS+, was used to evaluate the expression of interleukin-1 beta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in cerebral cortex from spontaneously hypertensive rats and normotensive rats subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-1 beta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was quantified by Northern blot analysis and compared with rat macrophage <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To correct for gel loading, blots were also analyzed with cyclophilin cDNA, which encodes an abundant, conserved protein that was unchanged by the experimental conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Interleukin-1 beta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> produced in the ischemic zone was significantly increased from 6 hours to 120 hours, with a maximum of 211 +/- 24% of interleukin-1 beta reference standard, ie, 0.2 ng stimulated rat macrophage <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> compared with the level in nonischemic cortices (4 +/- 2%) at 12 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (P &lt; .01; n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-1 beta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> at 12 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was markedly elevated in hypertensive rats over levels found in two normotensive rat strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits were also apparent only in the hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Brain interleukin-1 beta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is elevated acutely after permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and especially in hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that this potent proinflammatory and procoagulant cytokine might have a role in brain damage following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
