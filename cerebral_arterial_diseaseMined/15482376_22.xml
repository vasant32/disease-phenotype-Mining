<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to assess the signaling pathway of the neuroprotective action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> in the cerebral ischemic injury evoked by subjecting rats to 2-h occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) followed by 24-h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats received 17 beta-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> (1, 4 and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) 24 h before and 5 min after the completion of 2-h <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area was consistently observed in the cortex and striatum of the left hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells and DNA fragmentation in the penumbral zone were significantly reduced by 17 beta-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In line with these results, 17 beta-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> significantly increased Akt and cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> response element binding protein (CREB) with increased Bcl-2 protein in the ischemic area, whereas the elevated the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome10 (PTEN) phosphorylation was significantly reduced with decreased Bax protein and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of DNA fragmentation, PTEN phosphorylation, and Akt activation by 17 beta-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> were antagonized by iberiotoxin, a maxi-K channel blocker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, it is suggested that suppression of cerebral ischemic injury by 17 beta-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> may be ascribed to the maxi-K channel opening-coupled downregulation of PTEN phosphorylation and upregulation of Akt and CREB phosphorylation with resultant increase in Bcl-2 protein and decrease in Bax protein and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release </plain></SENT>
