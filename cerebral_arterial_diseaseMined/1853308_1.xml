<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Chronological changes in plasma or serum concentrations of various fibrinolytic parameters, such as tissue-type plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor, fibrinopeptide B beta 15-42 and FDP, were examined in 31 healthy volunteers before and after venous occlusion to determine a suitable time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277919" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">venous stasis</z:e> and a good parameter for use in a simplified venous occlusion test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277919" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">venous stasis</z:e> for 5 min, a significant increase in the serum concentration of FDP (from 38.3 +/- 21.1 to 100.9 +/- 87.2 ng/ml (n = 24)) was observed, and the increase was parallel with changes in the plasma concentrations of other fibrinolytic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The serum FDP level after 10 min VO was not significantly higher than that after 5 min VO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant decrease in <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-induced platelet aggregation was observed after venous occlusion when measured by the impedance method, but not by the turbidimetric method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, as a simplified test, the change in the serum concentration of FDP after VO for 5 min was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of this simplified test was evaluated in fourteen patients with stenosis of cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean percentage change in serum FDP concentration after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277919" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">venous stasis</z:e> in the patients, 34.5 +/- 54.8%, was significantly less than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, 156.5 +/- 90.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained on changes in plasma responses of other fibrinolytic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Measurement of increase in serum FDP concentration after venous occlusion for 5 min should be useful as a screening tests for the hypofibrinolytic or thrombotic state due to vascular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
