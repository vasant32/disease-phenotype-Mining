<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transcranial Doppler (TCD) sonography is useful to evaluate intracranial arteries, however, interpretation of the TCD results in anterior cerebral artery (ACA) is difficult because of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We try to define useful TCD indices and cut-off values to determine the variations of ACA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent TCD and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with cerebrovascular abnormality or inadequate temporal windows were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ACA status was classified as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (NL), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> (HP), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> (AP) according to MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TCD indices of mean flow velocity (MFV), pulsatility index (PI), ACA/middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) flow velocity ratio (ACA/<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FVR</z:e>), and asymmetry index (AI) of ACA were blindly compared with MRA between three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-one patients were included, and 193 patients (80%) were classified as NL, 34 (14%) as HP and 14 (6%) as AP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MFV was significantly lower in HP and AP (p&lt;0.001), however, PI and ACA/<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FVR</z:e> were not different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AI was significantly different between NL and HP (21.5% vs. 50.4%), NL and AP (21.5% vs. 105.2%) (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MFV of ACA should be interpreted with caution for its frequent anatomical variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>AI is useful to differentiate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ACA with optimal criteria </plain></SENT>
