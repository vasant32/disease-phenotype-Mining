<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Reduced extracellular matrix is a prominent feature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> (CAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported excessive ECM degradation in CA walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined collagen biosynthesis in CA walls and the molecular mechanisms underlying it in CA progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry showed reduced expression of procollagen type I, III, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32568">lysyl</z:chebi> oxidase (LOX) in CA walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with the LOX inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27413">beta-aminopropionitrile</z:chebi> resulted in enhanced progression of CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of procollagen type I, III, and LOX was inhibited by interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs) in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) was activated in IL-1beta-stimulated RASMCs, and treatment with NF-kappaB decoy oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) restored reduced expression of procollagen type I, III, and LOX in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NF-kappaB decoy ODNs ameliorated the expression of procollagen type I, III, and LOX in CA walls in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Collagen biosynthesis was significantly inhibited at the transcriptional level and in the posttranscriptional enzymatic modification in CA walls through upregulated expression of IL-1beta and the NF-kappaB pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reduced collagen biosynthesis may contribute to CA progression, and inhibition of this process may lead to the prevention of the progression and rupture of CAs </plain></SENT>
