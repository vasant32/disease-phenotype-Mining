<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: CT angiography (CTA) is a noninvasive technique for evaluating intracranial arterial stenoses and for following up on intracranial stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed a series of patients to assess the capabilities of CTA with respect to preinterventional und postinterventional diagnostic imaging for stent-assisted intracranial angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined 8 patients with 9 symptomatic intracranial arterial stenoses before and after stent placement with CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT angiographies were compared to the periprocedural conventional angiography with regard to the quality of the visualization as well as the dimensions of the identified stenoses and the implanted stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The extent of the preinterventional intracranial stenoses identified with CTA differed between -15% to + 12% from conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In any case we were able to assess stent position, expansion, and perfusion with postinterventional CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean residual stenosis after stent placement was 33% (13 - 48%) measured with conventional angiography and it was accurately estimated with a difference of +/- 15% in 5 of 9 stents by CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>4 residual stenoses were underestimated or overestimated between -20% and + 26% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further CTA controls of several patients showed good visualization of in-stent neointimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CTA is useful for stent planning and follow-up of symptomatic intracranial stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intracranial stents and their lumina are adequately visualized by CTA, especially in vertebrobasilar vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, residual stenosis and restenosis especially in the intracranial internal carotid artery and in the presence of calcified plaques may be incorrectly estimated by CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In case of doubt patients must undergo invasive angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In summary the use of CTA is a possibility for the primary follow-up of intracranial stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It cannot generally prevent further diagnostics, but it is a potential method for reducing invasive angiography </plain></SENT>
