<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors selected from this group 8 cases described in greater detail in which there was an evident temporal relationship between trauma and the development of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The severity of the sustained trauma was without a significant influence on the development of post-traumatic <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical Manifestations increased in intensity usually within the first 48 hours and in only one case they appeared 2 weeks after trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the clinical status of the patients of considerable interest was usually absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004372'>disturbances of consciousness</z:hpo> with presence of serious signs of focal central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of decisive diagnostic significance was cerebral angiography which localized the site of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and excluded presence of post-traumatic intracerebral haematoma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 7 cases <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> affected the main trunk or branches of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prognosis as to survival of such patients is generally good but in most cases disability of different degree developed following <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
