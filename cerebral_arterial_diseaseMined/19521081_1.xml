<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The characteristics and fate of intraluminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> (IT), which may incidentally be detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, are not well known and the optimal treatment strategy for IT remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We have identified patients with IT in either the extracranial or intracranial artery and followed up on their clinical courses and imaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We categorized it based on its <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and investigated clinical outcomes and fate of IT in those patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 495 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, 9 (1.9%, 8 men, age range of 61-84 years) were identified with IT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with IT could be categorized into three groups: a filling defect (4) during digital subtraction angiography (DSA), a stenosis-mimic lesion on DSA (3), and a mobile mass on carotid duplex (2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had follow-up vascular imaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete or partial resolution of IT was seen in 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients developed transient or minor ischemic symptoms, which were potentially related to IT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stenosis-mimic lesions and IT adjacent to atherosclerotic plaques appeared to be associated with unstable clinical courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IT can be categorized according to its morphological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The outcome may depend on the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and location of the IT </plain></SENT>
