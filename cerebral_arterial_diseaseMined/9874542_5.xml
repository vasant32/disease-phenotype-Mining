<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND &amp; PURPOSE: This study was performed to determine the usefulness of transcranial color-coded real-time sonography (TCCS) in detecting stenosis in the horizontal portion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using TCCS and the incident angle correction technique, we measured the peak-systolic flow velocity in bilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> in 45 consecutive patients in whom cerebral angiography was carried out within 1 week before or after TCCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three patients had a stenosis of 75% or greater and four had a unilateral occlusion of the extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) (the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICS</z:e> and ICO groups, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had a stenosis of 50% or greater (one bilateral and seven unilateral) (the M1S group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four patients had unilateral distal occlusion of the horizontal portion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (the M1O group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients had no significant extra- or intracranial stenosis on the ipsilateral or contralateral side (the control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean peak-systolic flow velocity on the affected side was 83.0 +/- 20.8 cm/s in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICS</z:e> group, 59.8 +/- 23.2 cm/s in the ICO group, and 62.3 +/- 33.7 cm/s in the M1O group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the control group, the mean peak-systolic flow velocity was 116.0 +/- 31.5 cm/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the M1S group, however, the mean peak-systolic flow velocity (334.2 +/- 35.7 cm/s) on the affected side always exceeded 180 cm/s (mean value +/- 2 SD in the control group), and was significantly higher than that in the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean peak-systolic flow velocity in the M1S group increased with the grade of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The M1S group members could easily be distinguished from the other group members by their peak-systolic flow velocity in excess of 180 cm/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Measurement of the peak-systolic flow velocity of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> by TCCS may help to identify a significant stenosis in the horizontal portion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
