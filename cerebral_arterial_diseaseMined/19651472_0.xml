<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An 86-year-old, right-handed, hypertensive man suddenly experienced blurring of vision predominating in the left visual field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurological examinations were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, except for left homonymous hemianopsia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Goldmann visual field testing revealed a left congruent incomplete homonymous hemianopsia with macular splitting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI, with a T2-weighted image, demonstrated a lesion of high intensity in the right lateral geniculate body (LGB), as well as the posterior part of the caudate nucleus, posterolateral thalamus, and dorsolateral thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRA revealed severe stenosis at the second segment of right posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SPECT revealed significantly decreased blood perfusion in the striate cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of an isolated, congruent, incomplete, homonymous hemianopsia due to lateral posterior choroidal artery (LPChA) region infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The LPChA possibly supplied the LGB through the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A horizontal, homonymous sectoranopia is typically the hallmark of an LPChA region infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, a homonymous hemianopsia may also occur when the entire LGB has been affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the case of homonymous hemianopsia, LGB damage due to LPChA region infarction should be considered, in addition to lesions of the visual pathway, such as the optic tract, optic radiations, and occipital cortex </plain></SENT>
