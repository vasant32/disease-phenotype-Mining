<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We reported a case of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> caused by a dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> that was successfully treated by intra-arterial fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 38-year-old man suddenly developed left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and became confused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He was transferred to our hospital one hour and 27 minutes after the ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Right carotid angiogram (CAG) revealed aneurysmal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the horizontal portion of the middle cerebral artery and occlusion of the anterior trunk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve million IU of tissue plasminogen activator was injected to fibrinolyze the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> of the occlusion site through a microcatheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After this, the patient became alert and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It took three hours and 30 minutes to gain recanalization after the ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Right CAG obtained the next day demonstrated the patency of the anterior trunk and the characteristic finding of the dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> viz "double lumen" as a result of fibrinolysis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the false lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Right CAG obtained two weeks later demonstrated "string and pearl sign" instead of the "double lumen" as a result of partial <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the false lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up CAG obtained nine months after the ictus demonstrated marked reduction of the aneurysmal size as the result of progressing <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the false lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The characteristic angiographic findings of the dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> such as "double lumen" and "string and pearl sign" seemed to be mostly influenced by the status of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the false lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In case of major cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> caused by the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> from the dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, intra-arterial fibrinolysis seems to be a possible treatment modality, even though it is accompanied by the risk of giving rise to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
