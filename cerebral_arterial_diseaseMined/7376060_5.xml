<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the operations, no reverse flow was detected in the cortical branch of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of postoperative studies were not always in good agreement with those of intraoperative studies and bypass function was relatively not good and labile in patients with only stenotic lesions and in those with "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>" </plain></SENT>
