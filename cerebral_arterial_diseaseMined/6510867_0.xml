<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 20 of these patients, an immunopathy could be verified via the iliac crest biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relevance, reliability and accuracy of iliac crest biopsy is compared with the corresponding properties of other conventional methods of biopsy and neurological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical syndromes of patients with immunovasculitis are analysed and compared with those of a group without detectable immunovasculitis in the iliac crest biopsy sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For immunovasculitides with neurological symptomatology, no typical complex of symptoms was seen compared with the control group which would support a suspected diagnosis of immunovasculitis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four selected case histories are described in keyword style </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It follows from the result of this study that iliac crest biopsy is a low-risk examination method which the patient can be expected to tolerate, which is far more accurate in respect of the specific question of an immunodisease such as immunovasculitis with a strongly predominant neurological syndrome, compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other conventional neurological examination methods including other biopsy methods </plain></SENT>
