<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we included 29 patients with SAH due to aneurysmal rupture, having 36 CT low density areas within the middle cerebral artery territory in whom a total of 56 Xenon-CT (Xe-CT) studies were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Collectively, we evaluated 70 hypoattenuated areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>rCBF levels were measured in two different regions of interest drawn manually on the CT scan, one in the low density area and the other in a corresponding contralateral area of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the low density area (22.6 +/- 22.7 ml/100 gr/min) rCBF levels were significantly lower than in the contralateral area (32.8 +/- 17.1 7 ml/100 gr/min) (p = 0.0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the injured areas deep <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (CBF &lt; 6 ml/ 100 g/min) was present in only 25.7% of Xe-CT studies, suggesting that hypodense areas are not always ischemic, whereas in 43.7% of the lesions/Xe-CT studies we found hyperemic values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with a better outcome had hyperemic lesions, suggesting brain tissue recovery in injured areas </plain></SENT>
