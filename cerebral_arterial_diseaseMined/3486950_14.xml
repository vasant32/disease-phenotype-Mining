<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the cerebellum there is a decrease in activity of 42% from the early [15-45 min postinjection (p.i.)] to the late (210-240 min p.i.) scan, while in the cortex the decrease is 18%, and in the basal ganglia there is no decrease within this time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp> there was no <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> uptake in the early as well as in the late scans, regardless of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> type, perfusion rate, or blood-brain barrier dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 11 of 43 patients with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> a real increase of 123I activity (mean +21%) was seen in the late images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This "filling in" phenomena might be useful in selecting patients for bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In these patients the diaschisis cerebelli, seen in the early scans, disappeared in the late images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The regional distribution of <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> changes with time; spatial ratios might be blurred by temporal changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High-flow areas such as visio-auditory centers can be delineated clearly after stimulation in fast early scans; in these areas the pharmacokinetics of 123I are different from other cortex regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To get the full information from the <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> brain uptake, both spatial and temporal variation must be measured </plain></SENT>
