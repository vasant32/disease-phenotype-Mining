<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In biochemical terms, the amyloid that infiltrates blood vessels in CAA is composed of the A4 or beta <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), a molecule related to gamma trace or cystatin C (seen in patients with hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> in Iceland, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCHWA</z:e>-I), or the PrP characteristic of spongiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036457" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="rida">scrapie</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using antibodies to synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> representing portions of the 4.2-kd Alzheimer A4 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and the gamma-trace <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, we immunostained sections of brain from patients with AD, senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of Alzheimer's type, and CAA with associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated colocalization of the A4 and gamma-trace <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> within arteriolar walls, but only rarely in A4 amyloidotic capillaries or senile plaque cores of amyloid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When gamma-tracelike reactivity was noted in capillary walls, it was sometimes noted within the cytoplasm of pericytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining was always more intense when the anti-A4 antibody was used as the primary antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gamma-trace immunostaining was more prominent on the adventitial component of arteriolar walls, whereas A4 staining was usually seen more diffusely throughout the blood vessel wall, especially in the media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rarely individual pericytelike cells showed prominent gamma-trace immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that A4 and gamma-tracelike molecules may colocalize within arteriolar walls within the brains of patients with AD, and highlight the fact that CAA identified with AD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCHWA</z:e>-I are not as biochemically distinct as was assumed previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore these findings suggest that other peptidases or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitors</z:chebi> may be found within amyloidotic microvessel walls and may contribute to senile brain change and CAA-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, including <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">encephalomalacia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
