<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten patients, studied with diagnostic cerebral angiography, were examined without knowledge of the angiographic results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data acquisition through the transtemporal acoustic window was performed using a magnetic sensor system to track the spatial orientation of the ultrasound probe while scanning the volume of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A color transcranial duplex system with a power Doppler mode was used, and 3D data sets were acquired before and after the injection of transpulmonary-stable ultrasound contrast medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ipsilateral to the transducer, the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) in 90%, middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) in 60%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three or more branches of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in 60%, posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) in 60%, and posterior communicating artery (PCoA) in 60% were successfully imaged without the echo contrast agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the contrast agent, the ACA, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, three or more branches of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>, and PCoA were visible in 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The anterior communicating artery was visualized in 40% without contrast enhancement and in 90% with contrast enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Contralateral to the transducer, the ACA (60%), <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (30%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three or more branches of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (10%), <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> (20%), and PCoA (20%) were successfully imaged without contrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Contrast enhancement improved the imaging success rate for the ACA (90%), <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (80%), three or more branches of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (80%), <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> (100%), and PCoA (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A transpulmonary-stable ultrasound contrast agent used in combination with 3D transcranial duplex ultrasonography can significantly improve the success rate for transcranial color duplex imaging of intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
