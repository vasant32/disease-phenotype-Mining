<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of velocity criteria applied to transcranial Doppler (TCD) signals in the detection of stenosis of the middle cerebral (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), distal vertebral, and basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-five patients who underwent both cerebral angiography and transcranial Doppler examinations in the workup of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed a mean of 7 +/- 5 days (range, 1 to 28 days) after TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interpretation of the angiogram was performed without input regarding the TCD findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TCD interpretation was performed according to standard criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When we used a mean velocity (MV) cutoff of &gt; or = 80 cm/s in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> as the criterion for stenosis, 10 of 12 stenoses of any degree were detected by TCD, with 11 of 87 false-positives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine of 12 MCA stem (M1) stenoses were detected when a cutoff of &gt; or = 90 cm/s was used, with 7 of 87 false-positives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When we used an MV cutoff of &gt; or = 70 cm/s as the criterion for &gt; or = 50% stenosis of the vertebrobasilar system, 5 of 6 stenoses were detected, with 15 of 85 false-positives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most important confounding factor was the presence of &gt; or = 75% stenosis of the extracranial internal carotid artery, resulting in both false-positive (from collateral flow) and false-negative (decreased volume flow from the proximal stenosis without adequate collateral flow) errors in TCD interpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When patients with &gt; or = 75% stenosis of the cervical internal carotid artery were excluded from analysis, a TCD MV cutoff of &gt; or = 80 cm/s identified 9 of 10 M1 lesions with 7 of 61 false-positives, and an MV of &gt; or = 70 cm/s identified 3 of 4 vertebrobasilar lesions causing &gt; or = 50% stenosis with 7 of 56 false-positives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TCD may be an effective screening test for M1 stenosis when velocity criteria alone are used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TCD may less reliably detect intracranial vertebral and basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
