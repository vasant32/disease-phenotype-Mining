<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> controls and patients with either left or right <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> lesions were asked to verify low- and high-imagery sentences and then to verify pictorial representations of the predicates of high-imagery sentences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High-imagery questions concerned either the shape or the color of objects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, perceptual discrimination of shape and color was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with right <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> lesions were impaired on the perceptual discrimination tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Left <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> patients did not significantly differ from controls on low-imagery sentences but scored significantly lower on shape and color questions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their impairment was distinctly more severe with the pictorial than with the verbal versions of shape and color questions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In comparison to patients with occipital left <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> lesions, patients with temporo-occipital left <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> lesions were selectively impaired on verbal and visual color questions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that patients with left <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> lesions lack knowledge about shape and color of objects, but that their ability to convert visual knowledge into mental images is preserved </plain></SENT>
