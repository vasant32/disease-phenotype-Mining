<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured rCBV with 99mTc erythrocytes after rCBF with 133Xe, and calculated rCBV/rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>rCBF and rCBV of the 25 affected hemispheres were classified as (a) patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rCBF [type I (n = 7) and type II (n = 3)]; (b) patients with decreased rCBF [type III (n = 6) and type IV (n = 9)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These two groups then could be subdivided according to findings of rCBV, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and increased blood volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>rCBV/rCBF increased as the cerebral perfusion pressure dropped from type I to type III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In type IV, other situations but cerebral autoregulation could be assumed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>rCBV/rCBF signifies vascular mean transit time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Type III (high rCBV/rCBF) assumed as the increased OEF, misery perfusion as reported in PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose rCBF, rCBV and rCBV/rCBF using SPECT can be an index for cerebral circulatory reserve </plain></SENT>
