<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Conventional CT angiography (CTA) is acquired during only a short interval in the arterial phase, which limits its ability to evaluate the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to compare the image quality and radiation dose of conventional single-phase CTA (SP-CTA) with a multiphase CTA (MP-CTA) algorithm reconstructed from a perfusion CT (PCT) dataset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients undergoing head CTA and PCT in 1 examination were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The PCT dataset was obtained with 40.0-mm-detector coverage, 5.0-mm axial thickness, 80 kilovolt peak (kVp), 180 mA, and 30 mL of contrast medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MP-CTA was reconstructed from the same PCT dataset with an axial thickness of 0.625 mm by using a new axial reconstruction algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A conventional SP-CTA dataset was obtained with 0.625-mm axial thickness, 120 kVp, 350 mA, and 60 mL of contrast medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We compared image quality, vascular enhancement, and radiation dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SP-CTA and MP-CTA of 50 patients (male/female ratio, 31/19; mean age, 59.25 years) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MP-CTA was significantly better than SP-CTA in vascular enhancement (P = .002), in the absence of venous contamination (P = .006), and was significantly higher in image noise (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MP-CTA used less contrast medium than SP-CTA and could demonstrate hemodynamic information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The effective dose of MP-CTA was 5.73 mSv, which was equal to that in conventional PCT, and it was 3.57 mSv in SP-CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is feasible that MP-CTA may provide both CTA and PCT results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Compared with SP-CTA, MP-CTA provides comparable image quality, better vascular enhancement, hemodynamic information, and more noise with less detail visibility with a lower tube voltage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The radiation dose of MP-CTA is higher than that of SP-CTA, but the dose can be reduced by altering the sampling interval </plain></SENT>
