<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined if stenotic disease affects both mechanisms in the posterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with altogether 13 stenosed (â‰¥50%) posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) sides were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, 6 control persons without a <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> stenosis were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow velocity was assessed from both <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCAs</z:chebi> with transcranial Doppler sonography; blood pressure was measured noninvasively via fingerplethysmography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurovascular coupling was assessed by a control system approach using a standard visual stimulation paradigm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral autoregulation dynamics were measured from spontaneous oscillations of blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity by transfer function analysis (phase and gain) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The parameters of neurovascular coupling and cerebral autoregulation did not show relevant differences between controls, nonstenosed sides, and stenosed sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 3 severely stenosed <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> sides showed a trend to a minor functional flow velocity change and attenuation of the neurovascular coupling mechanism in relation to sides with moderate stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Phase and gain were not altered on sides with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in a group of patients with mainly moderate stenosis of the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> neurovascular coupling and dynamic autoregulation dynamics seem to be unaltered </plain></SENT>
