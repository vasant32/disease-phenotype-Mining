<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> in patients hospitalized in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso for <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> to determine the risk factors in this black population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From November 1988 to October 1990, 317 patients (mean age 49 +/- 14 years, 62.5% males) under treatment for <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> or with a diastolic pressure &gt; 90 mmHg without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> therapy were examined at their initial hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into socio-economic groups according to their professional occupation and level of education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Criteria of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e>, including raised serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and blood <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> nitrogen, together with factors related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001095'>hypertensive retinopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebral vascular events</z:hpo> and hypertensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, diastolic pressure &gt; 130 mm Hg was observed in 43% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant inverse correlation between age and diastolic pressure (r = 0.23, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Response to initial anti-hypertensive treatment was good in 88% and proportional to severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hospital mortality was 18.6% (59 patients) including 39 cases during the first two days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mortality was not correlated with blood pressure, age, sex or socio-economic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Renal disease</z:e> was observed in 121 patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> in 117 (44%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> on at least one target organ was observed in 73.2% of the patients and on at least three target organs in 38.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> were younger (p &lt; 0.02) and responded less well to treatment than those without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These clinical observations confirm the high prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> and the gravity of <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> in Black Africans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In Burkina Faso, hospitalization for <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> often leads to the discovery of terminal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
