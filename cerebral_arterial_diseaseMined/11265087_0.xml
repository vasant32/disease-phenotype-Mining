<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 11 patients were prospectively included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and cerebral blood flow reactivity (CBFR) were measured by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomoscintigraphy scans (SPECT) before and after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven patients presented with isolated NHS and four presented with NHS associated with hemispheric symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lesions consisted of either high-grade (&gt;75%) bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> associated with vertebral or subclavian artery lesions or high-grade (&gt;75%) bilateral vertebral or subclavian <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> associated with medium-grade (&gt;50%) carotid lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presented with a functional circle of Willis with no significant intracranial arterial lesions and no corticosubcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 15 procedures were performed for revascularization of 19 arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cumulative morbidity/mortality rate was nil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> revascularizations were patent on postoperative controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results from this study show that multipedicular lesions lead to hemodynamic changes affecting hemispheric and vertebrobasilar territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatment can improve or normalize cerebral hemodynamic abnormalities and relieve NHS </plain></SENT>
