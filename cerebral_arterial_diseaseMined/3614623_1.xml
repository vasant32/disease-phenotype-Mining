<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using DCT and gamma variate curve fitting, mean transit times were determined for the terminal internal carotid arteries, middle cerebral arteries and middle cerebral-supplied Sylvian cortex at the level of the Circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six patients were studied sequentially, four before and after transcranial bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No arterial or tissue delays were found in patients without haemodynamic arterial lesions or cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven of nine patients with haemodynamic, extracranial carotid lesions showed ipsilateral delays in arterial or tissue transit times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tissue delays usually correlated with CT or clinical evidence of infarction </plain></SENT>
