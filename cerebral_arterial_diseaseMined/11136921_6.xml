<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a prospective study to elucidate the relation between ICAD and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> complications after CABG surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively studied 201 patients undergoing nonemergency isolated CABG surgery during a 39-month period (from March 1995 to June 1998) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each patient was evaluated before surgery with neurological examination, transcranial Doppler, and carotid duplex ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance angiography was used to determine the presence and severity of ECAD and ICAD in patients with abnormal findings on clinical examination, carotid duplex ultrasonography, or transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed after surgery and evaluated for the development of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Association between <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> complications and their potential predictors was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred nine patients (54.2%) were found to have ECAD and/or ICAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ECAD alone was found in 48 patients (23.9%), ICAD alone in 33 (16.4%), and both ECAD and ICAD in 28 (13.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one patients (25.4%) had single or multiple <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> complications: 23 (11.4%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011206" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">delirium</z:e>; 18 (9.0%) had hypoxic-metabolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo>; 7 (3.5%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; and 7 (3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>5%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, ICAD was found to have an independent association with the development of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> complications (prevalence OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.04 to 5.01) after controlling for covariates including age, occurrence of intraoperative events, and reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The joint effect of ECAD and ICAD was also statistically significant and stronger than ICAD alone (prevalence OR, 3.87; 95% CI, 1.80 to 6.52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that ICAD may be an independent risk factor for <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> complications after CABG surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results support pre-CABG evaluation of the intracranial arteries for the risk assessment of CABG surgery, at least in black and Asian patients, in whom there may be a higher prevalence of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
