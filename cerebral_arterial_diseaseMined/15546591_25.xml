<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The study aimed at an analysis of the kinetics of protein S100B and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and their relation to the site of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated 32 consecutive patients admitted within 6 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serial venous blood samples were taken hourly between 1 and 6 h, and at 12, 18, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neurovascular status was assessed on admission and monitored by repetitive extracranial and transcranial duplex sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neurological deficit was quantified by the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale score, and functional outcome after 3 months was assessed with the modified Rankin Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> flow velocities in basal cerebral arteries at admission showed significantly less S100B release than those with main stem or multiple branch occlusions (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>S100B cut-off values of 0.15 microg/l (between 6 and 18 h), 0.21 microg/l (between 24 and 48 h) and 0.5 microg/l (from 72 to 120 h) differentiated best between patients with initially <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathological sonographic vessel findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The release of S100B and NSE was highly correlated with the severity of the corresponding neurological deficit as well as with the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>S100B concentrations from 6 h on were associated with the functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>S100B values 48 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> above 0.2 microg/l indicated a poor functional status 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Protein S100B may serve as a monitoring parameter in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, especially with respect to the neurovascular status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, S100B obtains additional information about functional outcome </plain></SENT>
