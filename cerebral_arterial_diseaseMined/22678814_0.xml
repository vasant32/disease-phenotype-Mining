<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Absolute cerebral oximetry has not been studied in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> (SCD), a group at very high risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in whom prevention of brain injury is key </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: We measured absolute Hb saturation in cerebral tissue (S(CT)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>) in children with SCD using near-infrared spectrophotometry and investigated the contributions of peripheral Hb saturation (S(P)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>), hematologic measures, cerebral arterial blood flow velocity, and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> to S(CT)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also assessed the effects of transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We studied 149 children with SCD (112 HbSS/Sβ(0); 37 HbSC/Sβ(+)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>S(CT)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> was abnormally low in 75% of HbSS/Sβ(0) and 35% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HbSC</z:e>/Sβ(+) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>S(CT)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> (mean ± SD) was 53.2 ± 14.2 in HbSS/Sβ(0) and 66.1 ± 9.2% in SC/Sβ(+) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>S(CT)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> correlated with age, sex, Hb concentration, reticulocytes, Hb F, and S(P)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>, but not transcranial Doppler arterial blood flow velocities as continuous measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariable models, S(P)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>, Hb concentration, and age were significant independent determinants of S(CT)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cerebral vasculopathy was associated with ipsilateral cerebral desaturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transfusion increased S(CT)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> and minimized the inter-hemispheric differences in S(CT)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> due to vasculopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral desaturation, a physiologic marker of at-risk brain, is common in SCD, more severe in HbSS/Sβ(0) patients, and associated with peripheral desaturation, more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, and increasing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cerebral oximetry has the potential to improve the identification of children with SCD at highest risk of neurologic injury and possibly serve as a physiologic guide for neuroprotective therapy </plain></SENT>
