<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the alanine/valine (A/V) gene polymorphism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="12071">5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR), one of the key enzymes that catalyzes the remethylation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>, was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The VV genotype is correlated with increased plasma homocyst(e)ine levels as a result of the reduced activity and increased thermolability of this enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the association between the V allele of the MTHFR gene and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in an elderly Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> study patients was confirmed by CT of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The MTHFR genotype was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction followed by HinfI digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 256 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and 325 control subjects, the frequencies of the V allele were 0.45 and 0.32, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals adjusted for the other risk factors were, respectively, 1.51 (1.02 to 2.23) for the AV genotype and 3.35 (1.94 to 5.77) for the VV genotype compared with the AA genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both of these effects were statistically significant (P=0.041 and P&lt;0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in particular, the allele frequency of the V mutation was 0.56, and the association between the V allele and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was highly significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Plasma homocyst(e)ine levels were significantly higher in patients with the VV genotype than in patients with the AA or AV genotype, especially those with low plasma <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The V allele of the MTHFR gene was significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in an elderly Japanese population in a codominant manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The VV genotype may contribute to risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> through a predisposition to increased plasma homocyst(e)ine levels, and dietary <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> supplementation may be of benefit, particularly to patients with this genotype </plain></SENT>
