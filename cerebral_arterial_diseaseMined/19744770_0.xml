<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of frontal lobe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (FLA) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to ascertain whether subcortical ischemic changes were more associated with FLA than with parietal lobe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>) and temporal lobe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (TLA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs) from 471 Chinese <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lobar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was defined by a widely used visual rating scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were divided into non-severe, mild-moderate, and severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobe groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The severity of white matter lesions (WMLs) was rated with the Fazekas' scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical and radiological features were compared among the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequent logistic regressions were performed to determine the risk factors of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of FLA in our cohort was 36.9% (174/471) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Severe FLA occurred in 30 (6.4%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Age, previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and periventricular hyperintensities (PVH) (odds ratio (OR)=1.640, p=0.039) were independent risk factors of FLA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Age and deep white matter hyperintensities (DWMH) (OR=3.634, p=0.002) were independent risk factors of severe FLA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>PVH and DWMH were not independent risk factors of <z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi> and TLA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Frontal lobe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients may be associated with small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The association between WMLs and FLA was predominant over <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the parietal and temporal lobes, which suggests that the frontal lobe may be vulnerable to subcortical ischemic changes </plain></SENT>
