<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>Ectasia</z:mpath> of the carotid siphon has also been postulated as a possible cause of compressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>153 patients, in whom high resolution CT of the orbits and parasellar region had been performed for suspected anterior visual pathway pathology, were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence and severity of calcification and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> of the major intracranial arteries was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a high occurrence of carotid siphon calcification, increasing with age, and independent of sex or race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Calcification was very rare in anterior cerebral, middle cerebral and basilar arteries in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The amount and degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> also increased with advancing age, and was more frequently observed in carotid and basilar than anterior and middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the degree of calcification or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> and ophthalmological or neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
