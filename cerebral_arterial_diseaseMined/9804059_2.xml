<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> without modification by the effect of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anesthetics</z:chebi>, we examined the local and permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model in unanesthetized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The forebrain embolism was induced by intra-arterial infusion of microspheres of 50-microm diameter in freely moving rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From 2 to 48 hr following the injection, the water-, <z:chebi fb="57" ids="29102">Na-</z:chebi> and Ca-contents progressively increased while the K content decreased in the microsphere-injected hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the 3rd day, the water- and Na-contents gradually decreased and returned to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level on the 14th day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the Ca level remained elevated even on the 56th day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The animals showed signs of neurological deficits 24 hr after the injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In histopathological examination, large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas were present in the microsphere-injected hemisphere after 24 to 48 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One to two weeks later, the lateral ventricle was expanded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight weeks after the injection, the ventricle remained expanded and newly developed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas were observed in a scattered pattern around the fibrotic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results show the close correlation between the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and the increase/decrease of Na/K contents from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to the recovery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, and their changes are similar to those in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This model enables us to evaluate not only the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic insult but also the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> changes of the forebrain following the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
