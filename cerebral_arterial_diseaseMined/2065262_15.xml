<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the circumscribed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defects</z:hpo> of 3 patients, increment-threshold spectral sensitivity was measured with a guessing paradigm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine 116', 200 ms narrowband stimuli with maximum transmission between 450 and 660 nm were presented on a white background of photopic or scotopic luminance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity measured in the blind field was compared with that at matched positions in the patients' <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hemifield, and with that at corresponding positions in 2 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results show that spectral sensitivity in the blind field, albeit reduced by up to 1 log unit, shows <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> dependence on adaptation level, reflecting rod activity under scotopic, and cone activity under photopic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Characteristic discontinuities in the spectral sensitivity curve seen under light adaptation are evidence for colour-opponent processes, presumably involving primate beta <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> ganglion cells </plain></SENT>
