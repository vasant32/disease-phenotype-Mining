<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the possibility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurring postprandially has been suggested, no cases have been reported until now </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: A 78-year-old man experienced repeated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> after almost every ingestion of food and showed orthostatic and postprandial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An angiogram revealed occlusion of his left carotid artery and stenosis of his right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Postprandial as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> can be a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with severe occlusive cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
