<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine its accuracy for detection of stenosing or occluding lesions, 133 consecutive patients were studied by both transcranial Doppler sonography and selective cerebral arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis of findings was done separately for various arterial segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High values for sensitivity and specificity were found for detecting obstruction of the carotid siphon and main stem of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic reliability of transcranial Doppler sonography was also confirmed by the calculation of a chance-corrected measure of agreement (kappa), which was close to + 1 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subanalyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler sonography seems to be a valuable tool for noninvasive detection of intracranial lesions of the middle cerebral artery and carotid siphon </plain></SENT>
