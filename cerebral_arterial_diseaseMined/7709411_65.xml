<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> that develop after an artery is occluded evolve from an initial stage of "ischemic injury" (probably reversible) to an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> or an area where most neurons become necrotic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is scant information on the time that must elapse after the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> for neurons to undergo irreversible injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of these experiments was to chart the time course and the topographic distribution of the neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> that follows the occlusion of a large cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred fifty-one adult rats (including 15 controls) were used in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred forty-seven had the right middle cerebral artery occluded for variable periods ranging from 30 minutes to 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After processing the brains for histology, a meticulous structural evaluation of each specimen, including quantitation of necrotic neurons, was followed by a detailed statistical analysis of the neuronal counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Few neurons in isolated sites showed morphological signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> during the initial 4 hours; the first significant increase in the percentage of necrotic neurons (15%) was observed within the territory of the occluded artery after 6 hours (P &lt; .05); 12 hours after the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> most neurons (65%) had become necrotic (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pannecrosis involving neurons, glial cells, and blood vessels was observed at 72 to 96 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, even at this time pannecrosis involved only the preoptic area and the lateral putamen; a few intact neurons remained visible in the cortex, and scattered necrotic neurons could be identified beyond the edges of the "area of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000980'>pallor</z:hpo>," which does not become clearly demarcated until 4 to 5 days after the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a predictable progression in the development of neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> after a permanent <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Irreversible changes appear first in the caudoputamen and then spread to the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The causes for the progression of the lesion are not known; however, therapeutic interventions that start within the first 1 to 2 hours after the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> may alter the histopathologic responses to this form of injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It remains to be determined whether the extent of the neurological deficit induced by an <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> correlates with the number of necrotic neurons </plain></SENT>
