<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is manifestation of generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and this is clearly shown by the high prevalence of coexistence coronary and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial disease</z:e> in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cumulative findings on molecular and cellular biology have dramatically changed our concept of atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has become clear that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is fundamental to the process of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the relation between <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and PAD is not well characterized, the emerging data demonstrated that PAD is a common manifestation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> that is associated with a systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most important risk factors for PAD are similar to those of atherosclerotic disease elsewhere: age, male sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, and hereditary factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of inflammatory markers, especially after exercise, have been found to be higher in patients with PAD than in controls, and associated with prognosis as well as restenosis in patients with PAD after revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the general United States adult population, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is independently associated with PAD in a cross-sectional, nationally large representative sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of those evidences indicate that PAD is one aspect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, a disease rationally connects with <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, which may further change our preventive and therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
