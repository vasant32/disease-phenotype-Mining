<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present investigation was undertaken to study the ultrastructural <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of brain blood vessels during vasospasm following total <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was produced in rats by compression of the cardiac vessel bundle (i.e., <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>) using a metal hook that was introduced into the mediastinum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> lasted for 10 min with blood recirculation for 6, 12 and 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rat brains were perfusion-fixed and regions from the cerebral cortex and associated leptomeningeal vessels were evaluated by scanning and transmission electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We noted three general vasoconstrictive responses in vessels of various sizes including veins and arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These alterations related to the smooth muscle cell arrangement associated with each constricted vessel including a circumferential, and longitudinal arrangement, or a combination of both types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other features in the three types of vasoconstricted vessels included thickening of the vessel basement membranes with increased endothelial microfilaments and vesicular profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our studies present evidence that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of 10-min duration with blood reflow for 6, 12 and 24 h produces profound and variable vasospastic changes in some but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These vascular alterations are thought to be caused in part by vasoactive substances released both by endothelial and blood cells and by perivascular cellular elements in response to the ischemic episode </plain></SENT>
