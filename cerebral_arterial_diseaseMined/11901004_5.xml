<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to determine whether quantification at FAIR imaging can be used to assess regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in a manner similar to [<z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> 123]-iodoamphetamin ((123)I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>) single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT (SPECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine patients with internal carotid or major cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> underwent (123)I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> SPECT and FAIR imaging (single section, different TIs, 1.5 T) at rest and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690,31163">Diamox</z:chebi>) stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FAIR and (123)I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> rCBF values were compared and correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted to detect hypoperfused segments on FAIR images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: rCBF values of normally perfused segments were 41.53 and 51.91 mL/100 g/min for pre- and post-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> (123)I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> studies, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Corresponding values for pre- and post-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> FAIR images, respectively, were 46.64 and 59.60 mL/100 g/min with a TI of 1200 milliseconds and 53.23 and 68.17 mL/100 g/min with a TI of 1400 milliseconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(123)I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> and FAIR results were significantly correlated, with both pre- and post-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity (86%) in detecting hypoperfused segments was significantly higher with post-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> images (TI, 1400 milliseconds), and specificity (82-85%) and accuracy (80-82%) were higher with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pre- and post-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> images (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> TIs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The significant correlation, high specificity and accuracy in detecting hypoperfused segments, similar increases in flow on both post-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> images, and absence of the need for contrast enhancement suggest that FAIR imaging, like nuclear medicine study, is complementary to routine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging in the assessment of cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
