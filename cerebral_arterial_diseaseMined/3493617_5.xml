<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Particular emphasis is paid to the cerebral blood flow (CBF) findings studied with the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">Xenon</z:chebi>-133 inhalation technique using single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a 40-year-old female with right-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, angiography showed multiple segmental narrowings of the intracerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral computer tomography (CT) scans were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CBF studied 11 months after the HZO showed a generalized reduction of flow which, however, was more pronounced in the left hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On re-examination 8 months later both the mean hemispheric flow and regional CBF (rCBF) had increased to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a 66-year-old male with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002357'>dysphasia</z:hpo> and right-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, cerebral CT scans demonstrated two small deep left-sided <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CBF examination showed a generalized reduction of flow in the left hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The flow was slightly increased on re-examination 12 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">Xenon</z:chebi>-133 inhalation method represents a useful way to demonstrate the CBF pattern in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
