<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Conventional and genetic risk factors have been reported to play a role in the pathogenesis of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and differences may explain the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of disease presentation in different populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Chinese, middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) stenosis is the most commonly identified intracranial vascular lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The involvement of renin-angiotensin system (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) gene polymorphisms in this condition has not been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine whether conventional and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> genetic vascular risk factors are associated with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis, asymptomatic Chinese type II diabetic patients with and without <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis matched for age, gender and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Biochemical parameters and the genotype and allele frequencies of three <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> gene polymorphisms, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion, angiotensinogen (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e>) M235T and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) A1166C polymorphisms were then compared between 217 diabetics with and 490 matched diabetic controls without <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis selected from 2,202 diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis was associated with significantly increased systolic blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>, yet diastolic blood pressure and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was an increased prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and use of blood pressure-lowering agents in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>Albuminuria</z:mp> was also more commonly found in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hypertensive status, systolic blood pressure and <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> were strong, independent predictors of the presence of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No differences in the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> polymorphism distributions were observed between patients with and without <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In these asymptomatic type II diabetics, blood pressure indices and <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>, but not <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> gene polymorphism, were closely associated with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
