<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE: Among artifacts on three-dimensional (3D) angiograms, pseudostenosis in vessels adjacent to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> has not been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By using a phantom, artifacts seen in vessels adjacent to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> on volume-rendered 3D angiograms were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a 3D angiography system and a C-arm sweep, digital images were obtained with a 512 x 512 matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rotation was 30 degrees /second, and frame rate was 30 frames/second </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phantom <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were designed to simulate intracranial saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and their parent arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phantoms, consisting of a cylinder (inner diameter, 2 or 4 mm) and spheres, 10, 7, 5, 3, or 2 mm in diameter, were placed at 0 degrees and 45 degrees to the axis of rotation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two radiologists consensually recorded their findings regarding the presence and location of stenosis and its relationship to the angle of rotation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The maximum percentage of stenosis in the pseudostenosis area was measured on multiplanar reconstruction images by using a workstation computer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pseudostenosis was observed in the cylinder adjacent to the sphere at both 0 degrees and 45 degrees angles; it was on a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pseudostenosis was most obvious with 10-mm spheres; it was not seen when spheres were 3 mm or less in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The maximum percentage of stenosis of the pseudostenosis increased with sphere size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: On volume-rendered 3D angiograms, pseudostenosis was seen in the cylinder adjacent to the sphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The artifact lay on a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation, and sphere size affected the artifact </plain></SENT>
