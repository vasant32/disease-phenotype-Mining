<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 450 subjects were classified into 9 groups according to age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In people older than 30 years, calcification in the pineal region including pineal body and habenular commissure was found in about 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0006960'>Calcified choroid plexus</z:hpo> seems to be characteristic of aging process because the rate of its calcification increased in proportion to aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Calcification of the falx cerebri was also found to increase in proportion to aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Calcified cerebral arteries were observed in advanced-aged groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fact that people in the ninth decade had a smaller incidence in calcification of the cerebral artery than those in the eighth decade indicates the possibility that longer-lived people had less incidence of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003207'>arterial calcification</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
