<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are relatively rare, making up 1% to 2% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, most clinical series are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> in nature, with few reports of isolated <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their clinical presentation can vary greatly, and the potential for long-term sequelae during or after treatment remains relatively high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report our recent experience in 9 consecutive patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with a discussion of the unique clinical challenges of their evaluation and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 9 consecutive patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> from November 2003 to February 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their hospital charts and follow-up records were reviewed and summarized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: : We identified 6 male and 3 female patients ranging in age from 7 months to 69 years (median age, 53 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None had any associated trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three presented with intraventricular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The remaining 2 presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> of right-sided numbness, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four underwent endovascular embolization; 2 underwent surgical clipping; and the remaining 3 were managed medically and followed up conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> involved P1 (n = 2), P1-2 junction (n = 1), P2 (n = 4), and P2-3 junction (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At a mean follow-up of 3 months, 6 patients had excellent functional outcome with modified Rankin Scale score of 0 or 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The remaining 3 patients who presented in deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> did poorly (1 died and 2 had severe disabilities) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> pose a unique challenge and have many unresolved issues regarding treatment modalities </plain></SENT>
