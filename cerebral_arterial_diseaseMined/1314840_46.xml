<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present studies, we have investigated CSD activity in the penumbral zone following permanent middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion in the rat (n = 16/group), using double-barreled Ca(2+)-sensitive microelectrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Measurements of CSD activity were made for 3 h in each animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During this time, a varying number of spontaneous CSDs were seen in the control group (total was 30, with a range of 0-7/rat) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These CSDs were of varying duration: "small" (approximately 1 min) and "big" (5-45 min) CSDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During a CSD, the extracellular [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>] decreased to 0.11 +/- 0.07 mM (mean +/- SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 3 h, the extracellular [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>] in the cortex (penumbral zone) was either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (10/16 rats) or lowered to 0.5 mM (2/16 rats) or to 0.1 mM (4/16 rats) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the caudate nucleus (ischaemic core area), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats had an extracellular [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>] of approximately 0.1 mM when measured after the 3 h recording period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neuropathological evaluation of the brains of the animals, which had been allowed to survive for 24 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, revealed ischaemic damage in the dorsolateral cortex and caudate nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Administration of the noncompetitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, MK-801 (3 mg/kg i.p.), 30 min after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion resulted in 24 and 29% reductions in the volume of hemispheric and cortical damage, respectively, which was highly significant (p less than 0.0001); no protection was seen against caudate damage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
