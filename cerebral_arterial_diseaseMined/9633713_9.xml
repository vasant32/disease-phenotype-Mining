<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Dolichoectasia may cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> by <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, embolism, stenosis, or occlusion of deep penetrating arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The chi-square, Fisher's exact, and logrank tests were used to compare clinical characteristics, survival, and recurrence for patients with and without dolichoectasia among the 387 residents of Rochester, MN, who had brain CT or MRI for first <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> from 1985 through 1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve patients (3.1%) had dolichoectasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with dolichoectasia were more likely to have had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> fitting a clinical and radiographic pattern of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> than those without (42% and 17% respectively; p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dolichoectasia was detected in the vertebrobasilar system in eight patients (66.7%), in the carotid system in two patients (16.7%), and in both circulatory systems in two patients (16.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the following characteristics among those with and without dolichoectasia: age, sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, smoking, and preceding <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with dolichoectasia had better survival (relative risk [RR] for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, 0.26; p=0.04) after first <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> but higher rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence (RR, 2.4; p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dolichoectasia is detected in 38 of patients with first <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and is associated with better survival but higher rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
