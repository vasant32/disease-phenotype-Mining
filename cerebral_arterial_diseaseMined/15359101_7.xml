<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003207'>Arterial calcification</z:hpo> is a process of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, usually taking place within advanced atheromatous plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the coronary arteries, calcification seen on computed tomography (CT) often indicates severe stenosis, and is noted in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with coronary symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Calcification of the cerebral arteries is also frequently observed on brain CT, but its clinical significance has yet to be clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the clinical significance of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003207'>arterial calcification</z:hpo> on brain CT, we investigated the angiographic and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) findings of calcified cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects were 57 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom underwent brain CT, digital subtraction cerebral angiography and TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> subtypes were defined according to TOAST classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two clinicians who were blinded in respect to the patients' clinical history and to each other's interpretation, determined the presence of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003207'>arterial calcification</z:hpo> and the degree of angiographic stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cerebral artery calcification was noted in 23 patients (40%) out of a total of 46 arteries, consisting of 23 internal carotid, 15 vertebral, 5 basilar, 2 middle cerebral and 1 anterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients with calcification were significantly older and more hypertensive than those without calcification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients with calcification showed either large artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> or lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic alterations measured by TCD were rarely observed in <z:mp ids='MP_0006133'>calcified arteries</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The severity and extent of the atherosclerotic changes were significantly greater in the patients with calcification than those without calcification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003207'>arterial calcification</z:hpo> does not directly indicate hemodynamically significant atherosclerotic stenosis involving calcified segments, but indicates the underlying etiology of either large artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> or lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and raises the possibility of a diffuse atherosclerotic process being present in the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
