<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> caused by 70% to 99% stenosis of a major intracranial artery are at high risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on usual medical management, suggesting the need for alternative therapies for this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Stenting and Aggressive Medical Management for Preventing Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Intracranial Stenosis trial is an ongoing, randomized, multicenter, 2-arm trial that will determine whether intracranial angioplasty and stenting adds benefit to aggressive medical management alone for preventing the primary endpoint (any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 30 days after enrollment or after any revascularization procedure of the qualifying lesion during follow-up, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the territory of the symptomatic intracranial artery beyond 30 days) during a mean follow-up of 2 years in patients with recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> caused by 70% to 99% stenosis of a major intracranial artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aggressive medical management in both arms consists of aspirin 325 mg per day, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> 75 mg per day for 90 days after enrollment, intensive risk factor management primarily targeting systolic blood pressure &lt;140 mm Hg (&lt;130 mm Hg in diabetics) and low density cholesterol &lt;70 mg/dL, and a lifestyle modification program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sample size required to detect a 35% reduction in the rate of the primary endpoint from angioplasty and stenting based on the log-rank test with an alpha of 0.05, 80% power, and adjusting for a 2% loss to follow-up and 5% crossover from the medical to the stenting arm is 382 patients per group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Enrollment began in November 2008 and 451 patients have been enrolled as of March 31, 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first randomized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention trial to compare angioplasty and stenting with medical therapy in patients with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> and to incorporate intensive management of multiple risk factors and a lifestyle modification program in the study design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hopefully, the results of the trial will lead to more effective therapy for this high-risk disease </plain></SENT>
