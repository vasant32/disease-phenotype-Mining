<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Traumatic dissections of the middle cerebral artery have been reported while <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is very rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe a case of fatal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the left middle cerebral artery that occurred in the time interval between 2 and 6 hours after an apparently minor head trauma in a motor vehicle accident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 25-year-old woman was in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> health on admission to the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two hours later the patient manifested <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six hours later she was aphasic with right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours later the patient was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A third CT scan performed at that time showed a wide <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> of the left cerebral hemisphere and a hyperdense left middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient died 5 days after the collision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The autopsy confirmed the presence of the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and revealed <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the left middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Microscopically, the transverse rupture of the intima and of the elastic lamina along the whole circumference of the vessel was found at the beginning of the thrombosed tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the blunt head trauma caused a partial rupture of the wall of the left middle cerebral artery with consequent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the vessel and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Based on the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the middle cerebral artery and on the review of the morphological literature we propose that the 2 types of lesion, the dissection and the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, that may follow closed head trauma, might depend on a common denominator that is the primitive rupture of the intima and elastic lamina </plain></SENT>
