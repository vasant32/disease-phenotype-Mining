<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the location and severity of MRI signal abnormalities in cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> with subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> (CADASIL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: One hallmark of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> due to mutations of Notch 3 gene is the presence of MRI signal abnormalities in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MRIs of 75 patients (43 with symptoms) were reviewed by a neuroradiologist masked to their clinical status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After assessing the presence of MRI lesions on T1- and T2-weighted images (T1-WI, T2-WI) in different subcortical regions, the severity of hyperintensities on T2-WI was scored using a global rating scale and a regional semiquantitative scale in the periventricular white matter (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>), deep white matter (WM), basal ganglia (BG), and infratentorial areas (IT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients (90%) had hyperintensities on T2-WI located in the white matter, more frequent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> (96%) and WM (85%) than in the superficial white matter (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hyperintensities also occurred in BG (60%) and brainstem (45%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven patients (62%) presented with hypointensities on T1-WI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one-third of the affected individuals, white matter hyperintensities occurred in the absence of small deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on T1-WI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency and severity scores calculated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>, WM, BG, or IT hyperintensities increase dramatically with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These scores were higher in symptomatic compared with asymptomatic gene carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo>, Rankin score &gt; 1, or both occurred only in the presence of diffuse white matter signal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that different subcortical areas have different vulnerabilities to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The age effect we observed may show an accumulation of lesions with aging during the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A prospective study is needed to investigate if the rating of MRI lesions is of prognostic value in CADASIL </plain></SENT>
