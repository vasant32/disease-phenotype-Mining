<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intracranial mechanical thrombectomy is a therapeutic option for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients failing intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared patients treated by mechanical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> removal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (MERCI) thrombectomy after failed IV tPA with those treated with thrombectomy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We pooled MERCI and Multi MERCI study patients, grouped them either as failed IV tPA or non-IV tPA, and assessed revascularization rates, procedural complications, symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> rates, clinical outcomes, and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated outcomes stratified by the occlusion site and final revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 305 patients, 48 failed, and 257 were ineligible for IV tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nonresponders to IV tPA trended toward a higher revascularization rate (73% versus 63%) and less mortality (27.7% versus 40.1%) and had similar rates of symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and procedural complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Favorable 90-day outcomes were similar in failed and non-IV tPA patients (38% versus 31%), with no difference according to occlusion site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among patients failing IV tPA, good outcomes tended to occur more frequently in revascularized patients (47.1% versus 15.4%), although this relationship was attributable solely to middle cerebral artery and not internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp>, with no difference in mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among IV tPA-ineligible patients, revascularization correlated with good outcome (47.4% versus 4.4%) and less mortality (28.5% versus 59.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risks of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and procedure-related complications after mechanical thrombectomy do not differ with respect to previous IV tPA administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thrombectomy after IV tPA achieves similar rates of good outcomes, a tendency toward lower mortality, and similar revascularization rates when stratified by clot location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Good outcomes correlate with successful revascularization except with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> in tPA-nonresponders </plain></SENT>
