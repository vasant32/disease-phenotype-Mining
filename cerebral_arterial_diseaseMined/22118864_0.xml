<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> outcome by the National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Score (NIHSS) and heart rate variability (HRV) by power spectral analysis were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The LAA group had lower high-frequency power (HF, P=0.017), lower normalized HF (P=0.002), higher normalized low-frequency power (LF%, P=0.016), and higher ratio of LF to HF (P=0.003) than both the LAC and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression analysis in the LAA group showed that HF significantly correlated with early outcome (standardized coefficient=-0.486, P=0.016), and HF less than 3.9 [ln(ms(2))] was an independent risk factor for NIHSSâ‰¥4 at seventh day after admission (odd ratio=6.00, 95% confidence interval 1.02-35.37, P=0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between any HRV parameter and early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome in the LAC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were different autonomic function properties between LAA and LAC groups, and depressed parasympathetic modulation was associated with worse early outcome in patients with LAA </plain></SENT>
