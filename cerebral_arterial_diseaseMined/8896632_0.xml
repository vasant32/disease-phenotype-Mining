<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess time-of-flight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography that uses magnetization transfer contrast (MTC) pulses, tilted optimized nonsaturating excitation (TONE), and a 256 x 512 image matrix for the detection of small intracranial arteries and for the detection and quantification of intracranial arterial stenoocclusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To assess anatomic sensitivity, six interpreters, in a blinded fashion, reviewed the MTC/TONE <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiograms and selective intraarterial angiograms obtained in 70 patients within a mean interval of 5.5 days (SD, 1.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> intracranial angiograms were evaluated with regard to presence and degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> and anatomic variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Interobserver correlations for determining vessel length were comparably high for both methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A strong correlation was found between measurements obtained on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiograms and those obtained on intraarterial angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean vascular length averaged across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> arteries was 34.8 mm (SD, 28.1) on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiograms and 53.2 mm (SD, 36.8) on intraarterial angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-one stenoses and occlusions and 30 anatomic variants were identified with intraarterial angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> arterial variants and 100% of occluded vessels were graded correctly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 80% of stenoses greater than 70% and 88% of stenoses less than 70% were quantified correctly at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Specificity for identifying stenotic disease was 99% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite inferior display of vessel length, MTC/TONE <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography with increased spatial resolution was able to show the vast majority of high grade lesions visible at selective intraarterial angiography and may suffice for clinical decision making in many patients </plain></SENT>
