<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>During recent years, the risk involved in cerebral angiography has been considerably reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in our patient group this risk was still almost as high as that involved in operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Non-invasive examination by means of the ultrasonic Doppler procedure has been improved with a resulting success rate of over 95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Color coding stored in a computer program with the "Echoflow"-procedure allows for demonstration of the neck vessels giving an indication of the degree of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By this method, pictures of document quality are provided which can also be obtained by inexperienced examiners and interpreted more easily than curve registrations of the acoustic signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In comparison with angiography, the Echoflow method was less sensitive than the conventional ultrasonic Doppler procedure especially in cases of low-degree stenosis of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, in 2.7% of the cases, a correct Echoflow diagnosis could be confirmed during operation where angiography had not shown the changes correctly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As the Echoflow procedure does not give sufficient information on intracranial pathology, we have so far dropped angiography in emergency cases only when establishing the indication for operation; however, in follow-up examinations this method is used exclusively instead of angiography </plain></SENT>
