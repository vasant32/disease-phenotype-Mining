<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Magnetic resonance angiography and computed tomography angiography are new, noninvasive methods to provide images of the cerebral vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reliability of magnetic resonance angiography and computed tomography angiography when used to grade middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> remains to be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to study the interobserver and intraobserver variabilities of magnetic resonance angiography and computed tomography angiography in grading middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 50 middle cerebral arteries in 25 patients were studied with magnetic resonance angiography and computed tomography angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The films were read independently by two observers on separate occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Films were shown again to the same observer 4 weeks after the first reading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The degree of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> was categorized into four grades: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>/mild, moderate, severe, and occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The interobserver and intraobserver variabilities were calculated by the kappa statistic method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Interobserver variability for grading middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> was good (kappa = 0.78) for magnetic resonance angiography and moderate (kappa = 0.51) for computed tomography angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was perfect agreement between two observers in 86% of the vessels shown in magnetic resonance angiography and in 76% of the vessels shown in computed tomography angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Intraobserver variability for both imaging methods was good, with the kappa value in the range of 0.70 to 0.76 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that according to our protocol, magnetic resonance angiography is more reliable than computed tomography angiography in grading middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
