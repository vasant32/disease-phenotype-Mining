<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Platelet shape was examined in freshly fixed whole blood, using phase contrast microscopy, from 7 patients post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, 9 patients undergoing elective angiography for the investigation of <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>, and 17 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Platelet shape was abnormal in 29/33 patients and in 20 of them the distribution of platelet shape did not resemble that produced by known platelet activators, by venipuncture techniques known to produce platelet activation, nor by shearing platelet-rich plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In particular, the proportion of spherical platelets is too high relative to the proportion of smooth discoid shaped platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Addition of platelet-poor plasma from a patient post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelet-rich plasma did not reproduce the abnormality in platelet shape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, for patients post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> platelet shape was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in platelet-rich plasma, but the platelets were hypersensitive to <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-induced aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incubation of citrated whole blood at 37 degrees C resulted in an incomplete disappearance of the spherical platelets suggesting that the abnormal distribution of platelet shape consists of both a reversible and a more persistent abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reversible portion of the platelet shape abnormality seen in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> may be related to venipuncture-induced platelet activation; however, the nature of the persistent abnormality in platelet shape is presently unknown </plain></SENT>
