<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neuropathological alterations of small arteries consisting in thickening, reduplication and fragmentation of the internal elastic lamella, and granular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi>-Schiff-positive material deposited in the arterial media were demonstrated in 1 autopsy case by histochemistry and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This material reacted with a monoclonal antibody anti-elastin (aE), as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant increases of aE-immunoreactivity and elastin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression were found in cultured skin fibroblasts from 5 family members genetically affected by CADASIL, but not genetically and clinically healthy members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that alterations of the elastic apparatus are associated with CADASIL genotype and related to the clinical expression of the disease </plain></SENT>
