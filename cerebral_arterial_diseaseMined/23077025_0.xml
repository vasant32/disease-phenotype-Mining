<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Circulating endothelial cells (CECs) and microparticles (MPs) have been reported to reflect endothelial injury, cellular activation, and MP-mediated thrombin generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that these indices differ between children with cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> and arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (AIS) recurrence, and those with a single event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a single-center cross-sectional study of 46 children with AIS and cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> matched with pediatric controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIS recurrence was defined as new <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurologic deficit with radiologic evidence of further <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CECs and MPs were identified with immunomagnetic bead extraction and flow cytometry, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MP function as assessed by thrombin generation was determined using a fluorogenic assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten children had AIS recurrence while 36 had a single AIS event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CECs were raised in children with recurrent AIS, compared to those with no recurrence (p = 0.0001), and in controls (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Total circulating annexin V+ MPs were significantly greater in children with recurrence than in those with no recurrence (p = 0.0020) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These MPs were of endothelial or platelet origin, and a subpopulation expressed tissue factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, MP-mediated thrombin generation was enhanced in children with recurrent AIS compared to those with no recurrence (p = 0.0001), providing a link between <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, endothelial injury, and increased thrombotic tendency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite the wide spectrum of clinical and radiologic presentation of childhood AIS, indices of endothelial injury and cellular activation are different in patients with single and recurrent events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This novel approach has potential for furthering understanding of AIS pathophysiology and prognosis </plain></SENT>
