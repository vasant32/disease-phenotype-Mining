<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We presume that the results were based on the velocity of the blood flow in the pseudolumen of the dissected artery, and we believe that CT angiography is a useful and less invasive diagnostic tool for intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
