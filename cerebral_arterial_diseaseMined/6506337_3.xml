<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effect of various combinations of time between 2 and 20 min and between pressures of 2.8 and 10 bar (60 and 300 ft) breathing air or oxygen at 2.8 bar (60 ft), on the continued recovery of cortical evoked potentials (CEP), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and water content of the brain were studied in the dog cerebral arterial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was found that the compression-decompression cycle alone resulted in a rise in cerebrospinal fluid pressure sustained for at least 20 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CBF study at 30 min showed an increased flow in dived, nonembolized animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Water content of the brain was also significantly increased in these animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that the clearance of air is probably independent of pressure once past a threshold of 2.8 bar and is certainly hastened by oxygen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A time of around 8 min is probably required to clear the embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The evidence of gas bubble redistribution with recurrence and development of new sites of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular obstruction</z:e> in dogs exposed to significant inert gas uptake, however, suggests that a second problem of the clearance of recirculating gas exists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An incidental observation suggests that recently dived dogs may have been more prone to secondary deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of these studies again suggest that there may be advantages to confining the treatment of arterial gas embolism to 2.8 bar breathing oxygen </plain></SENT>
