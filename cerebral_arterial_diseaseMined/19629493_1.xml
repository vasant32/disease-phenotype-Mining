<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Pseudoaneurysm of the superficial temporal artery (STA) is usually caused by head or facial injury and is rarely reported in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is frequently discovered as a pulsatile cystic mass in the temple, and its diagnosis can be made with ultrasound or computerized tomography angiogram (CTA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment modalities consist of surgical excision and endovascular embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 14-year-old boy presented with a pulsatile, cystic, and painless mass in the left anterior temporal region, developed 6 weeks after head injury from a traffic accident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mass was 15 mm in diameter and compressible, and disappeared after manual compression of the proximal STA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bruit was audible over the mass with a stethoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CTA showed a pseudoaneurysm of the anterior division of the left STA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mass was resected with ligation of the proximal and distal ends of the STA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A pseudoaneurysm of the STA should be suspected in a child presented with a pulsatile, cystic mass in the temple, developed after head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It can be easily diagnosed with history and physical examination with the aid of imaging modalities such as Doppler ultrasonography and CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pseudoaneurysms are usually successfully treated with excision </plain></SENT>
