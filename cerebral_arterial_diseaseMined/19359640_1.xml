<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and intracranial arterial obstructions have a poor prognosis and a high probability of deteriorating at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of power motion mode Doppler (PMD-TCD) compared with CT angiography as standard in diagnosing intracranial arterial obstructions in patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> of &lt;24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> to the emergency department underwent high-resolution brain CT angiography and PMD-TCD within a 6-hour difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 100 patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PMD-TCD demonstrated 34 intracranial occlusions and CTA 33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 6 false-positives and 4 false-negative diagnoses with PMD-TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PMD-TCD had a positive likelihood ratio of 13.7, a negative likelihood ratio of 0.19, sensitivity of 81.8%, and specificity of 94% for detecting an <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> in any specific artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results for the middle cerebral artery were: positive likelihood ratio 24.6, negative likelihood ratio 0.045, sensitivity 95.6%, and specificity 96.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the anterior circulation, the results were: positive likelihood ratio 18.5, negative likelihood ratio 0, sensitivity 100%, and specificity 94.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For the posterior circulation, the results were: positive likelihood ratio &gt;1000, negative likelihood ratio 0.42, sensitivity 57.1%, and specificity 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The post-test probability for any occluded artery when PMD-TCD was positive increased for any admission National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score but was especially remarkable for National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale scores between 7 and 15 points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PMD-TCD is valid compared with CT angiography for the diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, especially in middle cerebral artery obstructions </plain></SENT>
