<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Many clinicians allow blood pressure to run high in patients with intracranial stenosis to protect against hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether higher blood pressure decreases the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Data on 567 patients in the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi>-Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease (WASID) trial were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Time to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the same territory of the stenotic vessel was compared in patients grouped by mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) and mean diastolic blood pressure (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>) during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional analyses were based on severity and location of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic stroke</z:hpo> risk increased with increasing mean SBP and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> on univariate analysis (P&lt;0.0001, P&lt;0.0001) and after adjustment for risk factors (P=0.0008, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Elevated mean SBP and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> also resulted in increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the territory in univariate (P=0.0065, P&lt;0.0001) and adjusted (P=0.0002, P=0.0005) analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with increasing SBP was driven largely by patients in the highest SBP group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with moderate (&lt; 70%) stenosis had increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.0001, P=0.003) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the territory (P=0.0002, P=0.010) with increased SBP and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with severe (&gt; or = 70%) stenosis had increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the territory with elevated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> (P=0.004, P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with intracranial stenosis, higher blood pressure is associated with increased (not decreased) risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the territory of the stenotic vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings argue strongly against the common clinical practice of maintaining <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> in patients with intracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
