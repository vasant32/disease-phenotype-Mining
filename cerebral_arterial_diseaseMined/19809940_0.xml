<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Cerebrovascular changes are rarely discussed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007206'>hemimegalencephaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These alterations have previously been associated with epileptical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE: We report the case of a 36-week gestation neonate presenting with total right <z:hpo ids='HP_0007206'>hemimegalencephaly</z:hpo>, as demonstrated by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in the first days of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Perfusion-weighted imaging displayed a clear hypervascularization of the right hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-tensor imaging showed an arrangement of white matter fibers concentrically around the ventricle on the right hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AngioMRI showed an obvious asymmetry in the size of the middle cerebral arteries, with the right middle cerebral artery being prominent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The baby was free of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> during his first week of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An electroencephalogram at that time displayed an asymmetric background activity, but no electrical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Perfusion anomalies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0007206'>hemimegalencephaly</z:hpo> may not necessarily be related to epileptical activity, but may be related to vessel alterations </plain></SENT>
