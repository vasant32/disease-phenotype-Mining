<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic value of T2-weighted radial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging for the detection of superficial cranial arteries' inflammatory involvement in patients with giant cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCA</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-three patients with suspected giant cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> underwent 3 Tesla (T) high-field MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T2-weighted inversion recovery (IR) fast spin echo images with radial sampling (BLADE-technique) were acquired and compared with postcontrast T1-weighted spin echo images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: T2-weighted images revealed mural <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in the superficial cranial arteries in 11 patients in concordance with severe inflammatory contrast enhancement in T1-weighted images (grade 4 in a 4-point ranking scale) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Excellent correlation (r = 0.82; P &lt; 0.001) of measured wall thickness in T1- and T2-weighted images was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate the potential of radial T2 weighted imaging for a first detection of inflammatory changes in the small superficial cranial arteries without the need for contrast medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Future studies are needed to evaluate the influence of spatial resolution of the T2 images and to improve the detection of moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCA</z:e> related changes in vessel <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
