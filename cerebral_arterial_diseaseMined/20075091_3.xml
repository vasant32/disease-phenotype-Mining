<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Use of the Merci retriever is increasing as a means to reopen large intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether there is an optimum number of retrieval attempts that yields the highest recanalization rates and after which the probability of success decreases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> consecutive patients undergoing Merci retrieval for large cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> were prospectively tracked at a comprehensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed ICA, M1 segment of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, and vertebrobasilar occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared the revascularization of the primary AOL with the number of documented retrieval attempts used to achieve that AOL score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For tandem lesions, each target lesion was compared separately on the basis of where the device was deployed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified a total of 97 patients with 115 <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median number of attempts per target vessel was 3, while the median final AOL score was 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Up to 3 retrieval attempts correlated with good revascularization (AOL 2 or 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When &gt;or=4 attempts were performed, the end result was more often failed revascularization (AOL 0 or 1) and procedural complications (P = .006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, 3 may be the optimum number of Merci retrieval attempts per target vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four or more attempts may not improve the chances of recanalization, while increasing the risk of complications </plain></SENT>
