<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> is usually seen in patients who have previously been treated by radiotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527390" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intracranial tumor</z:e> who then develop a relatively <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> change in neurologic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histology of the lesion mimics accelerated focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical and radiographic manifestations of one case were highly atypical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The vasculopathy became evident shortly after termination of radiation therapy for a fourth ventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002888'>ependymoma</z:hpo>, and the angiographic picture stimulated a diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second patient was more typical, with clinical symptoms developing 12 years after radiation therapy for an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_252'>oligodendroglioma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Occlusion of a proximal vessel that had been included in the radiation port was demonstrated radiographically and confirmed by pathologic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical, angiographic, and histologic features of these two cases are discussed and previously reported cases are reviewed </plain></SENT>
