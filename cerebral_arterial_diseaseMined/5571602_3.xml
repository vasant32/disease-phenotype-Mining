<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These collaterals are present in a high percentage of cases within a week of the ictus and are more common when the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has developed slowly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their presence in occlusion of the middle cerebral artery seems to offer some protection against infarction but in internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> they are less important than the circle of Willis and when present suggest inadequacy of this structure </plain></SENT>
