<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>So far, it has been unclear whether CSA can be used to assess stenoses of the intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study for the first time applies CSA to 26 patients with low-, moderate-, and high-degree M1 stenoses and 14 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using CSA, we studied spontaneous oscillations (M waves, 3 to 9 cpm; B waves, 0.5 to 3 cpm) in continuous recordings of transcranial Doppler of the middle cerebral artery and simultaneously recorded beat-to-beat blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A gradual decrease in pulsatility indexes confirmed the increasing hemodynamic relevance of the stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with control subjects, M-wave phase shifts between CBFV and blood pressure were gradually reduced with increasing degree of M1 stenosis (control subjects, 44.6+/-21.1 degrees; high-degree stenosis, 16.7+/-19.5 degrees ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The phase relation between B waves in blood pressure and CBFV was shifted to positive values (low-degree stenosis, -9.7+/-108.4 degrees; high-degree stenosis, 50.9+/-43.8 degrees ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Because B- and M-wave phase shifts seem to characterize the degree of autonomy of CBFV modulation, this study suggests that with increasing degree of M1 stenosis, the arteriolar function is impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It shows that CSA is of indicative use for the assessment of intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
