<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A recently completed prospective randomized multicenter cooperative trial failed to confirm the hypothesis that the procedure prevents further <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in patients with atherosclerotic internal carotid artery or middle <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyze findings of the study in detail, including possible effects on the natural history of the disease beyond the immediate perioperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Potential sources of bias that may have unpredictably affected the study are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These include observational bias (patient and therapist not blinded), "randomization-to-treatment" bias (high morbidity after randomization but before operation), and "prerandomization" or allocation bias (patients in the study representing a selected sample of the population with cerebrovascular disease) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The extensive analysis of secondary subgroups with small numbers of patients is discussed in light of the statistical methods used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two particular classes of patients not addressed in the study who might benefit from the procedure are defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They are patients failing the best available medical therapy and patients with clearly documented hemodynamic compromise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Possible indications for bypass surgery are suggested for the various lesions in light of the trial and of recent reports on the natural history and pathophysiology of ischemic cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Selected cases illustrating these indications are presented </plain></SENT>
