<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The meaning of these single parameters could shown depended on the specificity of the diagnostic question </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Local cerebral blood flow can be estimated most favourably by parametric images of area of inflow whereas transit time is most promising as a diagnostic tool for evaluation of total cerebral blood flow classified with reference to severity of the perfusion disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Appearance time is suited very well to estimation of collateral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood flow in great cerebral arteries could be seen well by non parametric imaging of radioactivity inflow in the brain supplying arterial vessels in the cranial floor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Applying a combination of the parametric images, the sensitivity for detection of disturbances of cerebral blood flow amounts to 0.91 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A specificity of 0.88 and accuracy of 0.90 were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The described combination of evaluation of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> using various parameters is considered a well suited method for detection of disturbances in local and total cerebral blood flow by means of planar imaging </plain></SENT>
