<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe a CADASIL family in which two members suffering from a vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> were shown to be CADASIL phenocopies: clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in these two patients were similar to those observed in their affected relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the skin biopsy performed on one of them did not reveal any GOM in the vascular smooth muscle cells, and the Notch3 mutation present in this family was shown to be absent in these two individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We emphasize the role of a direct DNA test for gene mutation to make a differential diagnosis between CADASIL and other forms of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
