<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to elucidate the correlation between arterial stiffness and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003207'>arterial calcification</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Arterial stiffness, as measured by brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003207'>arterial calcification</z:hpo>, as measured by CT angiography using a 40-multidetector scanner, were examined in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-seven subjects who were free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed that baPWV was significantly correlated with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003207'>arterial calcification</z:hpo> (r = 0.524, p &lt; 0.001) and age (r = 0.452, p &lt; 0.001), and multiple linear regression analysis indicated that age and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003207'>arterial calcification</z:hpo> were independent determinants of baPWV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We report that increased baPWV is closely associated with the degree of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003207'>arterial calcification</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the severity of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003207'>arterial calcification</z:hpo> is representative of the degree of systemic arterial stiffness </plain></SENT>
