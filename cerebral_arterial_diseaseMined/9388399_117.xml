<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: CADASIL (cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> with subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and leucoencephalopathy) is commonly overlooked or misdiagnosed owing to its recent identification and its variable mode of presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The defective gene in CADASIL is Notch3, which encodes a large transmembrane receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To set up a diagnostic test and to delineate the Notch3 domains involved in CADASIL., we undertook mutations analysis in this gene in a group of CADASIL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 50 unrelated patients with CADASIL and 100 healthy controls were screened for mutations along the entire Notch3 sequence, by means of single-strand conformation polymorphism, heteroduplex, and sequence analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Strongly stereotyped <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">mis</z:e>-sense mutations, located within the epidermal-growth-factor-like (EGF-like) repeats, in the extracellular domain of Notch3, were detected in 45 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clustering of mutations within the two exons encoding the first five EGF-like repeats was observed (32 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these mutations lead to loss or gain of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32460">cysteine residue</z:chebi> and therefore to an unpaired number of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32460">cysteine residues</z:chebi> within a given EGF domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of these mutations was found in the 100 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Because of the strong clustering and highly stereotyped nature of the pathogenetic mutations detected in CADASIL patients, and easy and reliable diagnostic test for CADASIL is feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that aberrant dimerisation of Notch3, due to abnormal disulphide bridging with another Notch3 molecule or with another protein, may be involved in the pathogenesis of this disorder </plain></SENT>
