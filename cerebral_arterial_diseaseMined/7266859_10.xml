<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Rupture of human cerebral arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> is followed by prolonged cerebral arterial constriction; there is evidence that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from such patients contains vasoconstrictor substances which may cause the arterial constriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to develop a small animal model for investigating the effects of such CSF on the calibre of cerebral vessels in situ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Carotid angiography of the cerebral arteries of the rat visualizes the internal carotid, middle cerebral, anterior cerebral and stapedial arteries plus the vertebrobasilar system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prostacyclin was injected during carotid catheterisation to prevent spontaneous and random occlusion of these cerebral arteries; in the presence of prostacyclin there was no <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> for up to 5 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The resolution achieved by the angiographic technique, which magnified the cerebral circulations 2.9 times, was sufficient to measure the diameter of the internal carotid and stapedial arteries of the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intracarotid infusion of 1.0 ml CSF collected from patients with ruptured cerebral arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> caused a rapidly developing contraction of cerebral arteries lasting up to 5 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, we consider that the rat may also be used as a model for investigating the aetiology of human cerebral arterial constriction after aneurysmal rupture </plain></SENT>
