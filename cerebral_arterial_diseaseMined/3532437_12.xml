<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The intracranial internal carotid artery Doppler signals were studied at 5-7 cm depth behind the eyelid using frequency spectral analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stenosis criteria were developed and methods of avoiding <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> with collateral effects devised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 33 intracranial ICAs visualized on the arteriograms, 22 were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> without stenosis and 11 displayed some degree of stenosis ranging from 20 to 75 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An additional 7 were totally occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Doppler criteria of stenosis representing elevated frequencies and symmetrical prominent low frequencies (SPLF) were utilized and separated from collateral effects to provide an overall accuracy of the technique of 88 percent with a 95 percent specificity and a 73 percent sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The technique appears sufficiently promising to justify further development and utilization </plain></SENT>
