<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> was widespread, affecting the distal branches of small and medium-sized muscular cerebral arteries, as well as the anterior and posterior spinal arteries, and vasocorona </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> was characterized by prominent intimal thickening, discontinuity or absence of the internal elastic lamina, and thinning and/or disappearance of smooth muscle in the tunica media with fibroplasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Slight intimal thickening was also observed in the arteries of the circle of Willis and its major branches, as well as in the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the arterioles, venules and veins showed no remarkable features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The arterial lesions were found only in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
