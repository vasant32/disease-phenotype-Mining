<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Improvements in computers, television systems, and image intensifiers have contributed to the increased image quality of DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With DSA, the vessels such as the carotid bifurcations and the intracranial vasculature can be visualized with a 2-3% concentration of contrast material, while with conventional angiography, the concentration of contrast in vessels is 40-50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using IV DSA, visualization of the carotid bifurcations is of good or excellent quality 85% of the time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a high percentage of these cases, IV DSA replaces conventional angiography, although for imaging of the intracranial vessels, IV DSA is not as good as conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> patients, however, conventional intracranial angiography is not needed because IV DSA combined with computed tomography gives sufficient information </plain></SENT>
