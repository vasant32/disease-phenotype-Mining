<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, substantial reductions developed in both <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-stimulated and uncoupled respiration in tissue from the focus of the affected area in the striatum and cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A similar pattern of change but with lesser reductions was seen in the adjacent perifocal tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Succinate-supported respiration was more affected than that with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> in perifocal tissue at 2 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, suggesting additional alterations to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> components in this tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiratory activity recovered fully in samples from the cortex, but not the striatum, within the first hour of reperfusion following 2 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and remained similar to control values at 3 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, impairment of the functional capacity of mitochondria from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three regions was seen in the first 3 h of reperfusion following 3 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Extensive infarction generally affecting the cortical focal tissue with more variable involvement of the perifocal tissue developed following 2 h of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> impairment during the first 3 h of reperfusion was apparently not essential for tissue infarction to develop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, the observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> changes could contribute to the damage produced by permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> as well as the larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> produced when reperfusion was initiated following 3 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
