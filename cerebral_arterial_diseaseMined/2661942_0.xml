<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first group of 452 patients suffering from extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral artery disease</z:e> was analyzed by an intravenous digital subtraction angiography (DSA); the second group of 500 patients was subjected to a conventional aortic arch angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Research was based on comparative analysis of angiograms as per type and location of morbid changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the area of common carotid artery and internal carotid artery the stenosis was considerably more frequently detected by the conventional angiography than by the intravenous DSA, i.e. in 105 (20.0%) as compared to 40 (8.8%) patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar difference is indicated in a total number of morbid changes in these arteries detected in 248 patients (49.6%) by aortic arch angiography and in 154 (34.1%) patients by intravenous DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dissimilarity is noticed with minor atherosclerotic changes, while medium and major stenoses are detected with equal frequency by both methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The intravenous DSA more often indicated flexion of carotid artery, and considerably more often the vertebral artery flexion as found in 53 (11.7%) patients analyzed by intravenous DSA compared to 33 (6.6%) patients analyzed by conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Advantage of intravenous DSA is less complications and ambulatory performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The conventional angiography better indicates morbid changes in common carotid artery bifurcation and vertebral artery origin </plain></SENT>
