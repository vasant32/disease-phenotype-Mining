<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although associated clinical symptoms and signs are known, the mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the anatomical distribution of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> territory lesions caused by the various <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms are less well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Published reports have selected only special subgroups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> distribution, and clinical findings among 79 patients in the New England Medical Center Posterior Circulation Registry in whom brain imaging scans showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> that involved 1 or more cortical territories of the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-eight patients (61%) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> limited to the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> territory (pure <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>), while 31 (39%) also had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in other territories (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> were in the cortical territory of the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> in 47 patients (59%) and were cortical and deep in 32 (41%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> that were cortical and deep were more common in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>+ lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms were embolism of cardiac origin (32 [41%]), proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> (25[32%]), cryptogenic embolism (8[10%]), intrinsic <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> disease (7[9%]), vasoconstriction (4[5%]), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> (3[4%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with cardiogenic embolism and intrinsic <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> disease often had pure <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> territory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, while patients with proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> more often had <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>+ <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Visual abnormalities were present in 66 patients (84%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Motor <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, cognitive and behavioral abnormalities, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> were found in 20 patients (25%); only 12 (15%) had sensory signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The great majority of pure <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>+ territory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are caused by cardiac or intra-arterial embolism </plain></SENT>
