<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also examined the association of cerebral hemodynamics on single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography with the changes in brain volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The affected/unaffected ratio of the percent brain volume declined in patients without EC-IC bypass surgery (p &lt; 0.02, n = 4), and the affected/unaffected percent regional cerebral blood flow ratio increased in patients with the surgery (p &lt; 0.03, n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">Acetazolamide</z:chebi> reactivity increased in the affected hemisphere of patients with surgery (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two-year increase (decrease) in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> reactivity of the affected hemisphere showed a significant positive correlation with 2-year changes in the affected/unaffected percent brain volume ratio (R2 = 0.737, p = 0.0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Change in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> reactivity might be a good predictor for brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in cerebral artery occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
