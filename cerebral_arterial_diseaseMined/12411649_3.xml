<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we evaluated the diagnostic validity of contrast-enhanced TU using 3-dimensional time of flight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Indication for the UCA was an insufficient evaluation of the intracranial arteries after a combined approach with transcranial color-coded Duplex and transcranial Doppler examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We prospectively analyzed every patient referred for TU over 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, over a 3-month period, TU results were compared with 3-dimensional time-of-flight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Indication for use of UCA was met in 61 of 687 patients (8.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After UCA application, a diagnostic result was achieved in 75% of cases during transtemporal and in 81% during transforaminal insonation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of TU in the diagnosis of intracranial stenosis were 83% and 82%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Use of UCA was necessary in 8.8% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A diagnostic benefit was achieved in 75% to 80% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Contrast-enhanced TU demonstrated a high sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of intracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
