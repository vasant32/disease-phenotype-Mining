<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of the present study was to assess neurological function in 11 severe atherosclerotic middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) disease patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) and hemodynamic compromise and determine the efficacy of superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were eight patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and three with severe <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the bypass procedure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 11 patients experienced reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during a mean follow-up of 34.36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgical revascularization increased regional cerebral blood flow (mL/100g/min) from a mean of (+/- standard deviation) 25.9+/-7.39 preoperatively to 32.3+/-7.72 postoperatively, and improved regional cerebrovascular reactivity from -6.42%+/-14.61% to 30.14%+/-23.93% (p = 0.014) in the eight patients with atherosclerotic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrated the benefit of STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass for patients with medically refractory and symptomatic atherosclerotic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion with hemodynamic compromise </plain></SENT>
