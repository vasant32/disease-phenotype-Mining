<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Musical murmurs (MMs), sometimes called seagull cry, goose cry, honks, or cooing murmur, are murmurs with a single frequency that sounds like a musical tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Doppler detections usually show mirror-image parallel strings or bands of low to moderate frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Musical murmurs are mostly described in <z:mp ids='MP_0006114'>cardiac murmurs</z:mp> and have seldom been mentioned in cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of 12,000 patients from our neurosonographic data base of the past 7 years was conducted to find patients who had MMs during color-coded carotid and transcranial duplex sonographies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-six musical murmurs were found in 60 patients (0.5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studied patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 44 men and 16 women with a mean age of 63.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Musical murmurs may occur with or without simultaneous turbulent flows, or very close to a high-intensity frequency (with systolic spindles) turbulent flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Musical murmurs are detected more frequently in intracranial vessels (94%) than in extracranial cervical arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pathologic changes corresponding to the area of MMs were high-grade stenosis of the arteries (58 MMs), small arteries serving as collateral circulation (5 MMs), carotid cavernous sinus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> (2 MMs), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> (1 MM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifty (88%) of 57 patients with stenotic arterial lesions had histories of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, and 64% of the cerebrovascular events occurred on the side appropriate to the MMs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of MMs in color-coded carotid duplex and transcranial color-coded duplex sonography imply severe underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> that require prompt treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further cerebral angiographic study is warranted to clarify the underlying pathology in patients with MMs </plain></SENT>
