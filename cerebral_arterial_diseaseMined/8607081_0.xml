<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accurate preoperative detection of the site of CSF leakage is important because inaccuracy may require a more extensive exploratory surgical procedure in the repair operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are few reports on evaluation of magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging in diagnosing CSF leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging of two cases of postoperative CSF rhinorrhea is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 53-year-old woman and a 29-year-old man underwent suboccipital operations for microvascular decompression of the facial nerve in <z:hpo ids='HP_0010828'>hemifacial spasm</z:hpo> and for removal of an acoustic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100008'>schwannoma</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both cases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> findings were useful in preoperatively delineating the site of the CSF leakage, which was confirmed during the repair operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging may be useful in identifying the site of CSF leakage following the suboccipital approach to the cerebellopontine angle </plain></SENT>
