<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report we present a case of a 72-year-old female patient admitted to the hospital with unstable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Triple coronary artery obstructive disease and severe bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> were diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A combined, simultaneous surgical procedure was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After total circulatory by-pass with a membrane oxygenator, the patient's body temperature was lowered to 32 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the cool-down period, three proximal anastomoses of segments of autologous saphenous veins were performed in the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immediately afterwards, bilateral carotid endarterectomy was performed, followed by three distal anastomoses to coronary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient showed a satisfactory post-operative outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that the combination of moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, hemodilution with appropriate hemodynamic control, as used in this patient, was an effective method of cerebral protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The simultaneous approach of carotid endarterectomy and coronary artery by-pass surgery should be seen as a safe option for the treatment of this type of patient </plain></SENT>
