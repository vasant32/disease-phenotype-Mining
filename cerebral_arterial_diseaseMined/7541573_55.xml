<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The induction of neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> has been studied after various durations of transient middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to measure the numbers and anatomic distribution of cells exhibiting apoptotic bodies as an indication of DNA fragmentation and apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as a function of duration of transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> of male Wistar rats (n = 24) was occluded for 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes (n = 4 per group) with the use of an intraluminal monofilament, and reperfusion was instituted for 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA fragmentation was measured in paraffin sections with the use of a terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase (TdT)-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick end-labeling (TUNEL) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adjacent sections were stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin for analysis of ischemic cell damage, and immunohistochemical double staining methods were used for cell identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sham-operated rats (n = 4) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats not subjected to any surgical procedure (n = 4) were used as controls for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Within 5-microns-thick coronal sections, DNA fragmentation was present in 0 to 3 apoptotic cells in each hemisphere of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, sham-operated rats as well as in the contralateral hemisphere of ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 10 to 20 minutes of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, apoptotic cells exhibiting DNA fragmentation (10 to 20) increased in the regions of selective neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in the preoptic area and in the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 30 to 60 minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, scattered apoptotic cells (30 to 60) exhibited DNA fragmentation and expanded into areas of selective neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 90 to 120 minutes of occlusion, groups of apoptotic cells (70 to 200, &gt; 95% neurons) were primarily localized to the inner boundary zone of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A range of mild to severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion stimuli induce internucleosomal DNA cleavage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The presence and anatomic location of apoptotic cells exhibiting DNA fragmentation after transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596298" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral occlusion</z:e> indicate that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> accompanies neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
