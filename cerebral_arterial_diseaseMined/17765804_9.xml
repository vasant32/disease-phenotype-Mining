<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective record review of 76 children with cerebral arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> occurring between 44 weeks of conceptional age and age 19 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These children were seen by our pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group between September 1, 1989 and August 1, 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the following clinical presentations: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, focal <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278061" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">altered mental status</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared the frequency of each presentation in children with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> up to and after age 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Children aged &lt;1 year were significantly more likely than older children to present with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (45.5% vs 10.8%, P = 0.01) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278061" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">altered mental status</z:e> (36.4% vs 7.7%, P = 0.02), and there was a trend for them to be less likely than older children to present with focal <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> (45.5% vs 76.9%, P = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Children aged &lt;1 year with cerebral arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were more likely to present with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278061" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">altered mental status</z:e> than children aged &gt;or=1 year, and may be less likely to present with focal <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings may aid in the recognition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in young children </plain></SENT>
