<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> upon rCBF were studied </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">Mannitol</z:chebi> failed to modify blood flow during the occlusion period, but was effective in preventing any further decrease of blood flow during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals receiving <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> had an improved postischemic recovery of blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The correlation of ischemic severity and postischemic brain damage and the effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> on these parameters are discussed </plain></SENT>
