<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: CADASIL is a hereditary form of small-vessel disease caused by mutations within the Notch3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRI abnormalities have been found both in asymptomatic and symptomatic CADASIL individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Quantitative measurements on cerebral MRI were performed in 64 CADASIL individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI lesions were quantified using a semi-automated segmentation technique based on local thresholds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MRI total lesion volume correlated significantly with disability (Rankin Scale) on both T1- and proton density (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>)-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant inverse correlation between total lesion volume and overall cognitive performance as determined by the Mini-Mental State Examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age but not sex was correlated with lesion load both on T1- and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no detectable influence of the Notch3 genotype on quantitative MRI variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates correlations between MRI lesion volume and clinical characteristics in CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal studies are now warranted to investigate whether quantitative MRI could be used as an adjunct outcome measure in future therapeutic trials in CADASIL </plain></SENT>
