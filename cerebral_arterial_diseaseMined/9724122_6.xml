<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both patients underwent posterior fossa <z:hpo ids='HP_0002885'>medulloblastoma</z:hpo> partial resection, followed by craniospinal RT in which a <z:chebi fb="240" ids="27638">cobalt</z:chebi> 60 source was used; 40 Gy were given to the whole brain plus a 15-Gy boost to the posterior fossa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both patients received multiagent chemotherapy, immediately following radiation therapy in the first case and after repeated craniotomy for recurrence 13 years after radiation in the second case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They experienced multiple sequelae from radiation and chemotherapy, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>psychomotor delay</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, 20 years after treatment, they remained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> free and able to work, until they presented with focal neurological deficits and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in both cases showed no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence, but did demonstrate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in a posterior cerebral artery distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography revealed multiple mid-sized arterial wall irregularities as well as focal stenoses consistent with a postirradiation vasculopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiological mechanisms, radiological appearance, and incidence of this syndrome are reviewed from the literature </plain></SENT>
