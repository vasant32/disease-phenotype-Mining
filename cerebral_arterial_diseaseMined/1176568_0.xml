<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is often the first sign of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> occurring in a foot with satisfactory skin and may be triggered off by trauma or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Obstruction at various levels of the profunda femoris artery, of the main leg arteries with calcification of the media, are the usual characteristics, whether the patient is diabetic or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This explains why reconstructive vascular surgery is rarely possible but this, nevertheless, remains the best chance for obtaining healing of trophic disorders with limited removal of the toes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No failure was observed in cases of axillo-femoral or femoro-femoral by-pass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>But, as in diabetics, one may, in elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100758'>gangrene</z:hpo>, attempt to conserve weight-bearing areas thanks to medical treatment in association in some cases with lumbar sympathectomy when the patient's general condition makes this possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mortality is low when patients are selected for operation and depending on the surgical technique adopted, e.g. sub-cutaneous by-pass or surgery of the origin of the profunda femoris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mortality is less than 7 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>100 during the first month (one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 31 vascular operations, one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 40 sympathectomies), but the mortality during the first 6 months exceeds 20 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>100 due to cardiac, or cerebral complications or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>urinary infection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prevention of digestive symptoms, nutritional, renal or urinary complications, and electrolyte disturbances is essential together with physiotherapy and reduction in time spent in hospital, for example, the patient may be sent home and treated by the district nurse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>135 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo>, including 48 diabetics, aged over 70 years, admitted to hospital in 1971 at the Saint-Joseph hospital, illustrate these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>109 patients with 114 diseased limbs, had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100758'>gangrene</z:hpo> or ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Out of 80 survivors, beyond 6 months, i.e. 84 limbs, in 75 cases the weight bearing areas were preserved, in 9 cases <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> was necessary but in 8 of these it was possible to carry out <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> below the knee and walking was possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These functional results justify attempts to maintain weight bearing areas or, at least, the knee, whatever the duration of healing or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> of a toe or of the metatarsus; in Syme's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> of the leg, healing requires 2 to 4 months </plain></SENT>
