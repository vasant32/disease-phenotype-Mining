<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Precutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) is currently performed to treat supraaortic <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> for middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) stenosis in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> with the use of a microballoon (2-2.5 mm in diameter and 10-13 mm in length) in 10 consecutive patients (mean age, 48 years) who met the following criteria: high-grade M1 stenosis (&gt; 70%) and mild neurologic deficits (NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale &lt; 4) and/or recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) resistant to anticoagulation, or a large area of hypoperfusion in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory on brain perfusion SPECT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, we administered antiplatelet agents and evaluated the status of restenosis by angiography (n = 2), brain perfusion SPECT (n = 4), and/or transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Stenotic arteries were successfully dilated in nine of 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angioplasty failed in one patient because the balloon could not pass through the tortuous cavernous internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the patients experienced either peri- or postangioplasty complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Residual stenosis was less than 50%, and clinical improvement, including elimination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> in four patients who had suffered resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>, was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients; improvement of the cerebral perfusion was also noted in two patients with a large hypoperfusion area in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average follow-up period was 11 months (range, 2 to 36 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None experienced recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TCD revealed decreased flow velocity of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> after angioplasty in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> of the proximal portion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> seems to be a safe and effective therapeutic technique for the prevention of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
