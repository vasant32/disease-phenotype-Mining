<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019360" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ZONA">herpes zoster</z:e> with varicella <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo> in which a granulomatous necrotizing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> was present in the optic nerve and brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> was observed even in foci devoid of inflammatory reaction in surrounding tissue, and was therefore interpreted as a primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> caused by varicella </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first time a granulomatous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> has been described as an integral part of varicella <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo>, although others have made similar observations in the eye and even in viscera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings support the recent suggestion that so-called granulomatous <z:mp ids='MP_0001864'>angiitis</z:mp> of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> may be caused by the varicella virus </plain></SENT>
