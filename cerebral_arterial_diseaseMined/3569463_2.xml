<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A technique is described herein which improves the reliability of an established model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent injection of the cervical internal carotid artery with 0.1 ml of 1-h-old fragmented autologous blood clot through an external carotid artery cannula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pterygopalatine artery was ligated prior to embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At killing 2 h after embolization, clot was observed in the proximal middle cerebral and posterior cerebral arteries in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Areas of reduced blood flow at 2 h postembolization were assessed by digital image processing of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="43448">iodo</z:chebi>-[<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31225">antipyrine</z:chebi> autoradiographic images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No-flow and low-flow areas were measured for each of approximately 25 serial brain sections with a computerized bit-pad </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Volumes were calculated and lesions localized by anatomical reconstructions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No animal sustained a hemorrhagic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One animal sustained only a very small area of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the internal capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining seven, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had large regions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the middle cerebral distribution involving cortex and basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Posterior cerebral involvement was observed in six of the seven animals as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The contralateral hemisphere was unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Volume values could be calculated for primary vascular distributions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Most variability occurred in the pattern of posterior cerebral involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The technique described produces a relatively consistent region of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the middle and posterior cerebral artery distributions in the rat and is a useful model for the study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
