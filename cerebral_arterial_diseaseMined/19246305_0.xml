<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical value of the three-dimensional (3D) CT module of the flat-panel digital subtraction angiography (DSA) system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted among 278 patients receiving examination with rotational 3D-CT of INNOVA 3100 flat-panel DSA system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AW4.3-04 workstation was used to perform the 3D reconstruction and INNOVA CT reconstruction, and the imaging data were analyzed in comparison with the clinical results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 3D-CT of the flat panel DSA system displayed the conditions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> in 54 cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002408'>cerebral arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> in 25 cases, and the intracranial conditions in 24 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The blood supply and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> vessels were clearly displayed in 57 cases, and the effects of embolization and endovascular stenting were evaluated in 27 and 21 cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rotational 3D-CT was used to evaluate complete embolization in 24 cases, and failed to display the feeding arteries of small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in 11 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The vascular lesions, biliary tract lesions, and the occurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> during interventional therapy were observed in 58, 5 and 25 cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The 3D-CT module of the flat-panel DSA system can easily display abnormal vascular lesions and provide comprehensive anatomical information to facilitate interventional therapies and complication monitoring </plain></SENT>
