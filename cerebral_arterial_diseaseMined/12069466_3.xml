<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: We report the use of transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) examinations in children (mean age 12.7 years; range 0.5-18 years) without an open fontanelle, using TCD equipment with a 2 MHz pulse wave transducer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our results over a 7-year period are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 858 children were referred from the paediatric outpatient department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were divided into three groups according to the reason for referral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found positive pathological results in the following: (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and orthostatic dysregulation (0.4%, three out of 728); (2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurological symptoms (5.4%, six out of 112); (3) other indications (22.2%, four out of 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value of finding an abnormality was very low (0.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TCD examination is ineffective in children with non-specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> or orthostatic dysregulation due to the specific limitations of this method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found a higher percentage of abnormal results in children referred for other indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, since these children usually undergo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging (and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography, if necessary), in our opinion the TCD examination does not add any additional information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The value of TCD in children is not in the primary diagnosis of disease but in the follow up of known vascular processes (e.g. stenoses) or in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases including <z:mp ids='MP_0001864'>angiitis</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
