<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the calculation of cerebral blood flow loss ratio after cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> using the data obtained from transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD), by deducing regional cerebral blood flow loss index (rCBFLI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The data of TCD performed in 31 cases of unilateral stenosis in the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) were collected and analyzed for deducing the formula for calculating the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis index (STI): STI=1 (Vm(0)/Vm(1)) x (PI(1)/PI(0)), where Vm(0) is the mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> velocity of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> blood flow (derived from the measurements in 908 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects at varied ages receiving TCD) and Vm(1) the mean velocity at the stenosed <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, and PI(0) and PI(1) stand for the pulsatility index before and after stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ratio of PI(1) to PI(0) is likely to be equivalent to the ratio of Q(1) to Q(0) (Q(0) and Q(1) represent the volume of blood flow in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> condition and after stenosis, respectively), thus the equivalence can be extended as rCBFLI=(1 Q(1)/Q(0)) x 100%=(1 PI(1)/PI(0)) x 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>rCBFLI after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis was calculated in 31 cases accordingly, and by means of correlation analysis, we found positive correlation between rCBFLI and Vm(1) (r=0.76, P &lt; 0.001) and between Vm(1) and STI (r=0.85, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the same way, rCBFLI of 55 sides with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis in 43 cases were analyzed, and positive correlation between rCBFLI and Vm (r=0.76, P &lt; 0.001) and between rCBFLI and STI (r=0.83, P &lt; 0.001) was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: rCBFLI can be used to evaluate the degree of regional cerebral blood flow loss due to <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, and the combination of rCBFLI and STI may provide an insight into the changes of cerebral hemodynamics in this pathologic condition </plain></SENT>
