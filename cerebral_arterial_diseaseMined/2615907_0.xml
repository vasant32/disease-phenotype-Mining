<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first case: A 27 year-old man developed left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> four days after hitting his neck against a bed rail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography showed complete occlusion of the right extracranial internal carotid artery 1.5 cm distal to its origin and emboli in distal branches of the right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second case: A 32 year-old man developed disturbance of consciousness with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002427'>motor aphasia</z:hpo> and right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> a few hours after hitting his chest and neck against baggage hanging from a crane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography showed complete occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery and no abnormalities of the left internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>He was treated with STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis two weeks after the accident </plain></SENT>
