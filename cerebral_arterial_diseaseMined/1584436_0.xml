<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with unilateral ICA stenosis less than or equal to 80% had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> transcranial Doppler findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>80% of patients with unilateral and 50% of patients with bilateral ICA stenosis of more than 80% including those with occlusion showed a collateralization via the ipsilateral anterior and/or posterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>20% of patients with unilateral and 50% of patients with bilateral ICA stenoses of more than 80% (including occlusion) had two or three collateral pathways, including the ophthalmic artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Another ten patients with stenosis or spasm of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) showed increased flow velocities with turbulence in the narrow segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In four patients with severe <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease with a systolic peak velocity of more than 200 cm/s, the Doppler waveform distal to the lesion was damped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Decreased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measured by 99mTc-HMPAO-SPECT was found in two patients with severe <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Another patient with moderate <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis with a systolic peak velocity of 140 cm/s showed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebral perfusion pattern </plain></SENT>
