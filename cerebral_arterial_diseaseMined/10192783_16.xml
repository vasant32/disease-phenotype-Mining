<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its neuroprotective effects in other species, particularly on functional outcome, have not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have therefore examined the ability of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3490">CMZ</z:chebi> to ameliorate the functional deficits produced by a focal cerebral ischemic lesion in the marmoset, a New World primate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six monkeys received permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO); six further monkeys received pMCAO with administration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3490">CMZ</z:chebi>, 5 min after the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp>, by intraperitoneal bolus injection and by subcutaneous implantation of an osmotic minipump, which released <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3490">CMZ</z:chebi> for 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The monkeys were trained and tested preoperatively on a number of behavioral tasks which were repeated 3 and 9 weeks after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="3490">CMZ</z:chebi>-treated monkeys were better than non-drug-treated monkeys at using the disabled arm contralateral to the lesion and also showed a reduction in contralateral spatial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0150088" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">hemineglect</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postmortem histopathological analysis at several stereotaxic levels showed a significant reduction in the area of ischemic damage in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3490">CMZ</z:chebi>-treated monkeys compared to that in untreated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="3490">CMZ</z:chebi> treatment reduced the overall volume of damage by 31.8% (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> group, 370.8 +/- 37.4 mm3 of damage; <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3490">CMZ</z:chebi> group, 253.0 +/- 38.0 mm3 of damage) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3490">CMZ</z:chebi> is neuroprotective in a nonhuman primate species and is able to ameliorate the level of functional disability and reduce the size of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> produced by focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
