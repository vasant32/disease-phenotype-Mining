<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To compare the quality and diagnostic accuracy of images of intracranial steno-occlusive lesions obtained by conventional MRA and turbo MRA reconstructed using the zero-filled interpolation technique in the slice-select direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen patients with suspected steno-occlusive lesions of the intracranial arteries were studied with two types of three-dimensional time-of-flight angiography and conventional digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, 45 steno-occlusive lesions were quantitatively measured using calipers and correlated with DSA stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A phantom that simulated vessels with stenosis was also imaged using the two types of MRA under the same conditions as those employed in the clinical study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with conventional MRA, turbo MRA reduced the jaggedness of vessels and offered appearances more similar to those of DSA in the antero-posterior and lateral views </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The severity of stenosis was classified into five grades based on the percentage of occlusion: not significant (0-24%), mild (25-49%), moderate (50-74%), severe (75-99%), and occlusive (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither turbo MRA nor conventional MRA showed any discrepancy from DSA above grade-1 stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The advantage of turbo MRA is its ability to reduce the jaggedness of vessels on conventional MRA, and to simplify the recognition of vessel contours without prolonging acquisition time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Turbo MRA and conventional MRA have equally high diagnostic accuracy for steno-occlusive lesions </plain></SENT>
