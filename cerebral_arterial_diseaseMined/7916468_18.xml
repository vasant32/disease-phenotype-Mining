<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Suboptimal cardiac or peripheral vascular Doppler examinations were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 75 intravenous bolus injections were made in 30 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spectral audio Doppler intensity was measured throughout the duration of contrast effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No clinically relevant adverse effects were noted, and Doppler enhancement was apparent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic confidence of the investigators when scored before and after Doppler enhancement improved from 35% to 91% (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Doppler intensity increased more than 16 dB in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> vascular regions investigated (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The contrast effect lasted for more than 120 seconds in the peripheral vascular and cardiac groups at equivalent doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intravenously administered SH U 508A is effective in markedly increasing cardiac, femoral arterial, and transcranial (cerebral arterial) Doppler signal intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effect improves the clinical diagnostic confidence in cases of suboptimal unenhanced Doppler examinations </plain></SENT>
