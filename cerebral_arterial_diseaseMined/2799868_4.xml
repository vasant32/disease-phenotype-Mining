<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> plastic plugs with a suture embedded within them, we embolized the middle cerebral artery in 19 dogs via the cervical carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The free end of the suture remained accessible in the neck, and after variable dwell times traction was placed on the suture and the plug was withdrawn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Placement of the plug in the middle cerebral artery produced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The degree and distribution of cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were variable as evidence by the pathologically documented scattered nature of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> that resulted when the plug was left permanently in the middle cerebral artery and when it was removed after 1 or 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiography demonstrated occlusion of the middle cerebral artery with the plug in place as well as reperfusion when the plug was withdrawn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This modification of a previously described model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> provides an opportunity to study structural, physiologic, and biochemical events occurring in acutely hypoperfused cerebral tissue as well as critical changes leading to irreversible injury without the disadvantages of surgical manipulation required by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> previous models of reversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
