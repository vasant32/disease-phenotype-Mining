<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> after coil migration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> embolization is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 51-year-old woman suffered sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and unconsciousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography demonstrated diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and cerebral angiography disclosed a right internal carotid artery (ICA) bifurcation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and a right ICA-anterior choroidal artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated by endovascular embolization with Guglielmi detachable coils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the embolization procedure of the ICA bifurcation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, a coil strand detached in the sac had migrated into the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We did not retrieve the migrated coil, because the free coil strand was stable in the ICA and did not cause distal flow reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient suffered vasospasm of the right ICA and underwent intra-arterial infusion of fasudil <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the ICA on day 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient experienced infarction in the territory of the right anterior cerebral artery area and needed a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient was discharged with mild right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up angiography after six months revealed right ICA and middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, but the free strand of the migrated coil had not moved in the right ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We suspect that the coil strand might have induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or intimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> of the proximal M1 segment and right ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although late stenosis of the parent artery might be rare, it should be recognized as a long term complication of a migrated free coil strand in the endovascular treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
