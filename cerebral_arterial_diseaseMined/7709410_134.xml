<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Occluding a large intracranial artery in rats produces a brain lesion that grows in terms of an increase in both surface area and number of necrotic neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated whether reperfusing the ischemic territory 30 to 60 minutes after the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> would have a beneficial effect on either the clinical or the histological outcome of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred four adult rats (including appropriate controls) were used; 97 had a middle cerebral artery occluded by inserting a nylon monofilament via the right external carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> was transient in two groups and permanent in another; survival times were comparable for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control animals were subjected to a sham operation during which the artery was occluded for less than 1 minute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The outcome was evaluated by measuring the extent of the neurological deficit and the severity of the histological injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean neurological score and mean number of necrotic neurons in the cortex were more favorable after transient (30- to 60-minute) compared with permanent <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> (P &lt; .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the correlation between mean neurological score and mean number of necrotic neurons was highly significant: r = .951; P &lt; .001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The histological effects of an intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> in the adult rat can be predicted on day 1 by the neurological score described in this report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant improvement can be obtained in these animals by reestablishing arterial flow 60 minutes or sooner after the ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The pattern of cortical pannecrosis observed after permanent occlusion (&gt; or = 72 hours) was transformed into incomplete ischemic injury in most instances of transient occlusion </plain></SENT>
