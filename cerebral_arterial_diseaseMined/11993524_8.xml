<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are thought to be mostly due to intracranial small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, when a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patient with a relevant lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> does have severe ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) or middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) disease, it is unclear whether the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> is causative or coincidental </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If causative, we would expect ICA/<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease to be more severe on the symptomatic side than on the asymptomatic side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our aim was to compare the severity of ipsilateral with contralateral ICA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease in patients with lacunar ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 259 inpatients and outpatients with a recent lacunar ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and no other prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used carotid Duplex ultrasound and transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound to identify ICA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease, and compared our results with previously published data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In our study, there was no difference between the severity of ipsilateral and contralateral ICA stenosis within individuals (median difference 0%, Wilcoxon paired data p=0.24, comparing severity of ipsilateral and contralateral stenosis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall prevalence of severe ipsilateral stenosis was 5%, and the prevalence of severe contralateral stenosis was 4% (OR 1.6, 95% CI 0.6, 4.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the prevalence of ipsilateral and contralateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A systematic review of the other available studies strengthened this conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>Carotid stenosis</z:hpo> in patients with a lacunar ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may be coincidental </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to elucidate the causes of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and to evaluate the role of carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
