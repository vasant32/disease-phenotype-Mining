<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> in a general population was evaluated in brains of 400 consecutive autopsies of residents of Hisayama, Japan (November 1971-October 1983) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six samples taken from frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, occipital lobe, hippocampus, and basal ganglia of the same side of each brain were stained with both <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34653">Congo red</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The specimens were surveyed microscopically with polarized light for deposition of amyloid in the vascular wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 26 cases with brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, the region surrounding the hemorrhagic sites was further examined to study the probable causal relation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> and brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>Cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> was found in 40 of 218 men (18.3%) and 51 of 182 women (28.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence increased with age in both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frontal lobe was most frequently affected (66 cases), followed by parietal lobe (65), occipital lobe (49), temporal lobe (44), and hippocampus (32); the putamen was never affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> did not correlate with blood pressure or with the severity of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the 26 cases in which there was brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, only one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011695'>cerebellar hemorrhage</z:hpo>, in an 85-year-old man, was attributed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This case showed four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333101" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microaneurysms</z:e> in vessels, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> surrounding the hemorrhagic site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirty similar lesions were observed in eight cases without brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>Cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> may play an etiologic role in the development of brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> through formation of angionecrosis and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333101" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microaneurysm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
