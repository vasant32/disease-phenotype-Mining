<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the relationship between middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) trunk lesions and the etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger</z:e> type (B type) infarction, which was demonstrated as a diffuse subcortical low density area/high intensity area by CT/MRI, patients with both <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> lesions and B type infarction were studied clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients with B type infarction were diagnosed among 224 patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion/stenosis on angiography accounting for 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence was as high as 25% in M2 stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age of B type infarction patients was 64 years and 16 of them were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chronologically stepwize/<z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly-progressive</z:hpo> deterioration of clinical manifestations were observed in 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>, though half of them were mild or moderate in severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017494" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Gerstmann syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were present in 10, 1 and 2 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, while 11 showed transient decreases with marked changes (more than 31 mmHg in mean arterial blood pressure) in arterial blood pressure during their clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Out of 9 patients in whom cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured by 133Xe injection method/inhalation method, 7 demonstrated mild to moderate decreases in mean CBF (more than 30 ml/100 g/min) with no relation to the severity of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that hemodynamic mechanisms associated with hypoperfusion due to marked fluctuations in blood pressure are accelerating factors of B type infarction and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> lesions, even though <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the subcortical area due to leptomeningeal anastomosis may be mild or moderate </plain></SENT>
