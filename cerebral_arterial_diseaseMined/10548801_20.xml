<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CBF was measured by using continuous arterial spin labeling (CASL) both at rest and 10 minutes after 1 g intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> on a commercial 1.5 Tesla scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quantitative CBF images were calculated along with augmentation images showing the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interpretable studies were obtained from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on the image data as well as a region of interest analysis of CBF changes in middle cerebral artery distributions, varying patterns of augmentation were observed that suggested differing mechanisms of ischemic symptomatology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ability to obtain this information in conjunction with a structural MRI examination extends the diagnostic potential for MRI in cerebrovascular disease and allows the value of augmentation testing in clinical management to be assessed more widely </plain></SENT>
