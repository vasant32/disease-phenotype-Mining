<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> alterations of local cerebral perfusion following 30 min of transient right proximal middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) clip-occlusion in the rat and following two intervals of postischemic reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Local cerebral blood flow (lCBF) was assessed by [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrine autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain temperature was controlled at 35.5-36.5 degrees C throughout the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured lCBF in four groups of rats: (a) sham-operated controls (n = 5), (b) following 30 min <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (n = 5), (c) following 30 min of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion with 15-min reperfusion (n = 6) and (d) following 30 min of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> with 120-min reperfusion (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>lCBF was measured in seven regions of the ischemic and non-ischemic hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion induced an ipsilateral reduction of lCBF, which was most severe in the parietal cortex (8.4 +/- 4.0% of control, mean +/- S.D.), and dorsolateral caudoputamen (20.0 +/- 13.4% of control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>lCBF in the non-ischemic hemisphere and in ipsilateral regions lying outside the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory also decreased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>lCBF recovery was incomplete when assessed following only 15 min of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion of 120 min led to return of cortical CBF to control levels, but lCBF in the caudoputamen remained depressed (50-55% of control values) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Caudoputaminal CBF and cortical CBF values were highly correlated with one another under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and ischemic conditions, but this correlation was disrupted following reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these results, we speculate that, if a means were found to enhance the early recovery of lCBF following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e>, this might expand the therapeutic window of opportunity for the institution of other neuroprotective strategies </plain></SENT>
