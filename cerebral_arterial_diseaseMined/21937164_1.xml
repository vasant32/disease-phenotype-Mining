<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this case report, we describe two patients from different institutions who both required <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> wrapping with gauze/muslin for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> reinforcement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both patients developed an inflammatory foreign body response to muslin visible on MRI that resulted in a vasculitic stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> was at 6 months and 1 month postoperatively, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The stenoses rapidly progressed to near occlusion despite antiplatelet therapy, and in one case, an aggressive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient eventually developed leptomeningeal collateral flow that allowed tolerance of the stenosis, while the other patient required microsurgical bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These cases reports are the first to our knowledge that describe the adverse effects of muslin wrapping without adhesive reinforcement, as well as one of few reports to include follow-up angiographic imaging </plain></SENT>
