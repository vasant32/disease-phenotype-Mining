<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the risk factors of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (MCAS) in a dynamic manner so as to supply evidence to help prevent cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> based on the results of epidemiological study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 2500 residents were sampled randomly from the residents of Rongqi town and underwent questionnaire survey, physical examination, transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD), and detection of plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi>) in 2002, and 1068 of them that conformed with the criteria: (1) without symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, (2) with temporal window to conduct TCD, and (3) having undergone the questionnaire survey and blood biochemical examination, were enrolled for lone-term study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 2006 844 of the 1068 residents remained, 277 males and 567 females, aged 60 +/- 10 (12.5 - 88) who still conformed to the criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on the results of TCD examination of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> the residents were divided into two groups, MCAS group and non-MCAS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The morbidity of MCAS of the asymptomatic residents was 2.73% in 2002 and 4.62% in 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (GM) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> (HHcy) were the risk factors of MCAS based on the data of 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>But, 4 years later, history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HTN">hypertensive disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and HHcy were the risk factors and marriage status was also a factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The changes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, DM and BMI were the risk factors of MCAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MCAS exists in the asymptomatic residents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>History of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HTN">hypertensive disease</z:e>, DM, CHD and HHcy are the risk factors of MCAS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027051" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MR|mi|AMI">Heart attack</z:e> and changes of body weight contributed to MCAS </plain></SENT>
