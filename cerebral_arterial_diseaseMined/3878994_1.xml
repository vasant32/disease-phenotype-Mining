<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were studied 1 to 6 months after their last cerebral ischemic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data were analyzed in 4 cm2 regions of interest (fig. 1) and were compared to age-matched control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regional right/left ratios were tested for significance individually by comparison to 95 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>100 confidence limits found in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found a significant reduction in mean rCBF in the affected <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory; concomitantly, there was a lesser decrease in rCMRO2 significant only in the peri-sylvian area; this was associated with a moderate but significant increase in rOEF in the same areas (Table II, fig. 2 and 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Individually, the reduction in rCBF and the increased rOEF were significant in 5/6 and 2/6 patients, respectively (Table III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that rCBF is decreased distal to persistent hemodynamic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> obstruction in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This hypoperfusion appears due in part to a mild degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (as demonstrated by the occurrence of "misery perfusion"), indicating inadequate perfusion pressure distal to the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was associated with a metabolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of the cortex possibly resulting from either <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo>, or deactivation (diaschisis), or long-standing hemodynamic local failure or any combination of the three.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
