<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the brain of rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (AS) and the effects of Ginkgo biloba extract (GbE) on expressions of cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The experimental model of AS in rats were established by intraperitioneal injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28940">vitamin D3</z:chebi> with high fat/cholesterol diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GbE 100 mg/kg was administered to rats by ig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 8 weeks, the expressions of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-10, and IL-10R in the brain tissues of AS rats were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay, immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-10 in the brains were markedly higher in AS groups than that in control groups (6.11+/-0.15, 1.55+/-0.14, 0.54+/-0.04 ng/g wet weight vs 0.80+/-0.14, 0.33+/-0.09, and 0.33+/-0.02 ng/g wet weight, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha in the brains were markedly lower in GbE groups (3.82+/-0.54, 0.95+/-0.08 ng/g wet weight) than that in AS groups, the protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of IL-10 and IL-10R in the brains were markedly higher in GbE groups (0.85+/-0.06 ng/g wet weight) than that in AS groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: GbE inhibited production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, but up-regulated the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 and IL-10R in brain, which might be related with its anti-AS actions </plain></SENT>
