<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 27-year-old man had been admitted to hospital with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurological defects involving his legs and urinary system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An intervertebral disk was removed surgically, because a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> had been suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>But symptoms increased postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further imaging showed a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the internal iliac artery which was treated with coil embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INVESTIGATIONS: Further diagnostic tests excluded hematological, rheumatic and endocrinological causes for the development of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genetic differentiation was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Imaging then demonstrated "string of beads" small <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of intra- and extracerebral, renal, visceral and peripheral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TREATMENT AND COURSE: During the past three years the patient had repeated ruptures of the intra-abdominal arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> for which coil embolization and bypass grafting were performed, also to prevent further ruptures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Segmental mediolytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> is a rare condition requiring careful imaging and histological tests for its diagnosis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
