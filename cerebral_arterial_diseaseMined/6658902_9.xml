<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to elucidate mechanisms responsible for the contraction of isolated canine cerebral arteries induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15713">UTP</z:chebi>) and to ascertain whether <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15713">UTP</z:chebi> given intracisternally causes cerebral arterial constriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The latter was proven arteriographically to be the case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15713">UTP</z:chebi> (10(-4)M) and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi> were similar in potency, produced sustained contractions, and were more effective than other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26441">pyrimidine nucleotides</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unlike <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15713">UTP</z:chebi> was not antagonized by cinanserin and failed to cause constriction of mesenteric arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">Adenosine</z:chebi> similarly antagonized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15713">UTP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> nimodipine abolished contractions caused by high K+ but only incompletely antagonized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15713">UTP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, procedures that hyperpolarize the cell membrane (low K+ followed by K+) abolished tonic contractions induced by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15713">UTP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hyperpolarization prior to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15713">UTP</z:chebi> (with or without nimodipine) did not, however, prevent the occurrence of a phasic contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Papaverine or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33336">lanthanum</z:chebi> antagonized this phasic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15713">UTP</z:chebi> selectively affects cerebral arteries, may initiate contraction by releasing membrane bound <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>, depolarizes the cell membrane to open receptor operated and potential sensitive calcium channels, but does not inhibit the electrogenic Na-pump nor specifically antagonize the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
