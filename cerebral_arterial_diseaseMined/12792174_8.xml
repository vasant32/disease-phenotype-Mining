<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we implemented a protocol to assess CR by means of functional MRI (fMRI) using <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In 5 patients with cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> (CM/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> and white matter degeneration), 6 healthy elderly subjects (age-matched control), and 6 young healthy subjects, the CR in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> was evaluated by fMRI using gradient echo-planar Imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percentage signal change normalized by end-tidal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> value was measured in various brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects performed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> well without adverse reaction and significant gross motion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with CM showed significant qualitative and quantitative differences (p &lt; 0.05) as compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The volume of gray matter showing significant CR was significantly reduced in patients: by 40% in comparison to the age-matched elderly control group and by 60% when compared with the young controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CR impairment was most pronounced in the frontal cortices with a drastically reduced magnitude of the magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) signal change in the patients (-0.62 +/- 0.2% in patients versus -2.0 +/- 0.36% in age-matched controls, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A strong relation was evident between the fMRI-based CR reduction in patients with CM and the individual severity of structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> abnormalities (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that fMRI-based signal changes in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> reliably reflect cerebral vasoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The protocol is feasible in healthy young and elderly controls and patients with CM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Quantitative and qualitative assessment of the signal decrease in the T(2)-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> sequence and coregistration with individual anatomical data allow the generation of an individual cerebral vasoreactivity map </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Future research will address the effect of CR reduction on neuropsychological parameters in patients with CM </plain></SENT>
