<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Clinical observations and electron microscopic investigation of skin biopsies demonstrated connective tissue abnormalities in a sizeable proportion of patients with spontaneous cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissection</z:e> (sCAD), suggesting an unknown <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> as a risk factor for sCAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate in a case-control setting if patients with sCAD exhibit clinical signs indicative of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> or show a vascular phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated 43 consecutive patients with sCAD and 43 consecutive patients of similar age with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> of other etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent standardized MRI of the head and neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical investigation contained 25 items characteristic for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000974'>hyperextensible skin</z:hpo>, articular hypermobility, capillary fragility, and facial stigmata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A sum score counting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> positive items was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the diameter of the common carotid artery (CCA) and vertebral artery (VA) and heart valve pathologies were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Connective tissue sum scores did not differ between the sCAD group (mean 2.37 +/- 2.1, median 2) and the control group (mean 1.95 +/- 1.9, median 2, p = 0.34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One sCAD patient had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029434" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteogenesis imperfecta</z:e> (2.3%) and exhibited the highest sum score of 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the CCA and VA and the prevalence of heart valve pathologies did not show any significant differences between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The connective tissue and vascular phenotype did not differ significantly between patients with spontaneous cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissection</z:e> (sCAD) and control subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> of other etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings argue against a clinically apparent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> underlying sCAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e> in sCAD patients is low </plain></SENT>
