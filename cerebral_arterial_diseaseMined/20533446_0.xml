<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) is commonly used for the diagnosis of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, TCD indices to predict distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (M2) stenosis have not yet been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared TCD and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to validate a new index for the diagnosis of M2 stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent TCD and MRA were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on MRA, M2 stenosis was defined as &gt;50% narrowing beyond the bifurcation area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TCD index of the M2/M1 ratio was defined as the ratio between the mean flow velocity (MFV) obtained at a depth of 30-44 mm (M2) and a depth of 45-65 mm (M1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity of the M2/M1 ratio were calculated from the receiver operating characteristic curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic yield of elevated MFV (&gt;80 cm/s) and asymmetry index of &gt;30% for M2 stenosis were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the consecutive patients, 105 with M2 stenosis were compared with 123 without <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The M2/M1 ratio was significantly higher in the M2 stenosis group (1.10 versus 0.86, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity for M2 stenosis were most satisfying when the M2/M1 ratio of 0.97 was adopted as the cutoff value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic yield of the M2/M1 ratio was better than MFV or asymmetry index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The M2/M1 ratio may be a highly specific parameter for assessing M2 stenosis with TCD </plain></SENT>
