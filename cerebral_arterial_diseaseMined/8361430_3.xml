<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To assess the safety and efficacy of the intra-arterial administration of streptokinase within 24 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients who presented to the Austin Hospital casualty department between 3 and 22 hours after an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were considered for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eligible patients had pretreatment non-contrast computed tomographic scans of the brain to exclude haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Streptokinase (250,000 units) was administered directly into the common carotid artery or the cervical portion of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic cerebral haemorrhage, haemorrhagic transformation of infarction, angiographic reperfusion, clinical outcome at seven to 10 days and the frequency of other complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen patients were treated over a 16-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Major clinical improvement occurred in five patients (39%) at 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was associated with angiographically demonstrated recanalisation of a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in two patients and partial recanalisation in two others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> in two patients required therapy to be stopped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In five other cases mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> developed but the streptokinase infusion was completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Haemorrhagic transformation of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> occurred in four patients without clinical deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intra-arterial administration of streptokinase is safe in selected patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The theoretical benefit of an increased local thrombolytic effect and reduced systemic complications, compared with the use of higher intravenous doses, justifies a randomised clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>If therapies such as this are to be successful, rapid referral to an appropriate centre is necessary </plain></SENT>
