<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in 67 patients with cerebral vascular malformations (35 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> [<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>], 29 cryptic malformations, 11 venous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angiomas</z:mp> and 2 associated lesions) were studied retrospectively after the patient population was divided into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptics</z:e> [25] and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptics</z:e> [42] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several criteria were determined for each type of malformation in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They included patient's age, site of the malformation in relation to the cortex, size of the malformation, presence of a perilesional high-intensity signal on T2-weighted sequences and evidence of recent haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Epileptogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> seemed to be more superficial and more often associated with a perilesional parenchymatous high-intensity signal on T2-weighted sequences than non-epileptogenic malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Epileptogenic cryptic malformations were closer to the cortex, larger, and specifically but rarely associated with changes in signal of the adjacent brain tissue on T2-weighted sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The few <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angiomas</z:mp> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> were, paradoxically, located in the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
