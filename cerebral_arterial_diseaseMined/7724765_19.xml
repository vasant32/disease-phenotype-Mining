<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To compare the reliability of magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) angiography performed with magnetization transfer suppression and variable flip angle excitation with that of intraarterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in imaging of the cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty nonconsecutive patients referred for intraarterial DSA gave informed consent to also undergo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography of the intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 95% for detection of vessel occlusion (10 abnormalities) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For detection of substantial vessel stenosis (seven abnormalities), sensitivity and specificity were both 86%; for detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (six abnormalities), sensitivity was 83% and specificity was 98% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity were 100% for detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> (three abnormalities), vessel displacement (three abnormalities), and extracranial-intracranial bypass (two abnormalities) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography did not reliably demonstrate small feeding vessels of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> or faint residual perfusion of a thrombosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiographic diagnosis of disease of the intracranial vasculature has high sensitivity and specificity but still is limited in comparison with intraarterial DSA </plain></SENT>
