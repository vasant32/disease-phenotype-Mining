<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> of the bifurcation of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) can be approached through a small incision in the anterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pterion and the lateral aspect of the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone are removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is approached, using microsurgical techniques, by following the main divisions of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> to the parent trunk and the base of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Once the parent vessel and the origin of the major divisions are clearly identified, it is usually preferable to dissect and mobilize the entire aneurysmal complex to elucidate the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and prepare the neck for clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This approach offers the advantages of minimal brain retraction and minimal manipulation of the main trunk and perforators of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, it allows a more complete exposure of the aneurysmal complex and facilitates dissection behind the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, which is more difficult when the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is approached from the front by opening the sylvian fissure medially to laterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A potential disadvantage of this method is that proximal control is not obtained until the base of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is reached, but this has not been a problem in our experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other disadvantages are the need for a slightly larger bone flap and the potentially increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This approach is not suitable when the main trunk of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> is short and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is in front of the insula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is also not recommended for the rare cases in which the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> points back over the insula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During a 6-year period, this approach was used in 49 of 58 cases of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The only <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in this group occurred in patients who were in deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> before operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients were made worse by operative complications, and 2 more worsened as a result of postoperative vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was a significant incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> in this series </plain></SENT>
