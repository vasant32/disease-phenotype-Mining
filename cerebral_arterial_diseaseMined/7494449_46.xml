<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This type of fragmentation is characteristic of programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and suggests that neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may be more complex than simple necrotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present experiments provide a detailed examination of the regional localization and time course for apoptotic DNA fragmentation in the cerebral cortex following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spontaneously hypertensive rats were subjected to permanent right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and the cerebral cortices were examined for evidence of DNA fragmentation using electrophoretic, flow cytometric, and histological approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An electrophoretic examination of cortical DNA at 24 h after the occlusion indicated that the majority of nucleosomal ladders were in the transition zone or penumbra and the core of the infarction, with no fragmentation apparent in the contralateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A flow cytometric analysis of DNA fragmentation in intact cells revealed a similar pattern, with increased fragmentation observed in ischemic cortex vs. the contralateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Saggital sections taken 1.5 mm lateral to midline were collected from animals at 1, 4, and 24 h after the infarction and DNA fragmentation was examined histologically by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Quantitative analysis of these sections indicated that DNA fragmentation can be observed in the anterior and central area of the infarctions as soon as 1 h after the occlusion and that the extent and magnitude of the fragmentation increases at 4 and 24 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
