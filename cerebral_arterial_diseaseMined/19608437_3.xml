<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of this technique for the assessment of transcranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the degree of stenosis of the transcranial arteries on DE computed tomographic angiography (CTA) with bone removal was compared to those on standard CTA and time-of-flight (TOF) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: DE-CTA was performed using a dual-source computed tomographic scanner in 50 patients with suspected cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From the source images on DE-CTA, data sets with and without bone removal were reconstructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TOF-MRA was performed on a 1.5-T scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two blinded radiologists evaluated the segments of the internal carotid artery (C2-C7), the vertebral artery (V4), and the basilar artery for degree of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A five-step scale (0%-49%, 50%-69%, 70%-89%, 90%-99%, and 100% [occlusion]) for degree of stenosis was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Wilcoxon's signed-rank test was used for statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The degrees of stenosis on standard CTA were consistent with those on TOF-MRA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, DE-CTA showed significantly higher degrees of stenosis compared to standard CTA and TOF-MRA in both C2 segments (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, DE-CTA revealed a significantly higher degree of stenosis compared to standard CTA and TOF-MRA in the left C4 segment (P &lt; .01 and P &lt; .005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other segments showed no significant differences of stenosis among TOF-MRA, DE-CTA, and standard CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared to TOF-MRA, standard CTA showed similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In contrast, DE-CTA revealed significant overestimation of stenosis for segments with close relations to bony structures as well as in calcified stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Consequently, such findings on DE-CTA require confirmation with standard CTA or MRA to eliminate false-positive results </plain></SENT>
