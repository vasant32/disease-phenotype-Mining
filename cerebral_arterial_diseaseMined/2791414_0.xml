<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two patients with "my hand" sign in association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278135" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tactile extinction</z:e> from callosal lesion, one due to left anterior cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, the other due to right anterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral artery aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture, were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The examination of "my hand" sign was performed with the methods proposed by Brion et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our patients correctly responded when they grasped their own or the examiner's thumb with their left hand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>But they replied "my finger"when they grasped not only their own but also the examiner's thumb with their right hand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278135" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tactile extinction</z:e> was observed after a routine extinction test in one patient, and it was observed in the other after the following method: both patient's index fingers were disposed in his midline position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In these methods of extinction test, they made errors in saying "right" when both fingers were touched simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, they said "both" when their right index finger alone was touched (synchiria) during an extinction test using the following method: both index fingers of patients were approached by examiner to touch each other or for one of them to touch the examiner's finger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When they were asked whose finger they touched in this method (whose finger test), they made the same errors as seen in "my hand" sign test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These test results suggest that there is a common underlying mechanism in the "my hand" sign and extinction, because the sense of double stimulations felt when only one stimulation is given (synchiria), is a possible explanation for the "my hand" sign and the pathogenesis of synchiria appears to be related to extinction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
