<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This single centre, retrospective study was conducted with the following objectives: a) to describe the clinical characteristics and short-term outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751843" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ACA infarction</z:e> as compared with that of patients with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) infarctions, and b) to identify predictors of ACA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-one patients with ACA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were included in the "Sagrat Cor Hospital of Barcelona <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Registry" during a period of 19 years (1986-2004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients are entered in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry following a standardized protocol with 161 items regarding demographics, risk factors, clinical features, laboratory and neuroimaging data, complications and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of these 51 patients with ACA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were compared with those of the 1355 patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarctions and 232 patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> infarctions included in the registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Infarctions of the ACA accounted for 1.3% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n = 3808) and 1.8% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> (n = 2704) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> subtypes included cardioembolic infarction in 45.1% of patients, atherothrombotic infarction in 29.4%, lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in 11.8%, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> of unknown cause in 11.8% and infarction of unusual aetiology in 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In-hospital mortality was 7.8% (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 5 (9.8%) patients were symptom-free at hospital discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037823,C0869217" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Speech disturbances</z:e> (odds ratio [OR] = 0.48) and altered consciousness (OR = 0.31) were independent variables of ACA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in comparison with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0003690'>limb weakness</z:hpo> (OR = 9.11), cardioembolism as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism (OR = 2.49) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748618" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory deficit</z:e> (OR = 0.35) were independent variables associated with ACA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in comparison with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cardioembolism is the main cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in the territory of the ACA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Several clinical features are more frequent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751843" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ACA infarction</z:e> than in patients with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to infarction in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> territories </plain></SENT>
