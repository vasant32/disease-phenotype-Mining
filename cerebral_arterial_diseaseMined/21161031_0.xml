<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is debate in the recent literature concerning the impact of the location of stenosis in ICAD on outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some reports have suggested that disease processes and outcomes vary by vessel location, potentially altering the natural history and indications for intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we have performed a comprehensive, critical review of the natural history of ICAD by vessel in an attempt to assess the differences in disease specific to each of the vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our assessment concludes that only minor differences exist between patients with different vessels affected in vessel-specific ICAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have found that middle <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral artery disease</z:e> confers a lower mortality than vessel-specific ICAD in other intracranial vessels, asymptomatic disease follows a more benign course than symptomatic disease, and that plaque progression or the detection of microemboli on transcranial Doppler may predict poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Given the expanding indications for treatment of ICAD and rapidly developing endovascular techniques to confront this disease, a thorough understanding of the natural history of ICAD <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> the interventional neuroradiologist in determining when to treat and how to predict outcome in this patient population </plain></SENT>
