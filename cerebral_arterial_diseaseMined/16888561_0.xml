<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They can present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, medullary compression, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010266" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cranial neuropathies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In consideration of their surrounding regional <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, they present a formidable surgical challenge to the neurosurgeon using traditional techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent advances in endoscopic transnasal surgery have provided an additional approach for the treatment of these difficult lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We present a case of a large vertebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> causing mass effect on the medulla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Initial treatment consisted of endovascular trapping of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>; however, because of concerns that the remaining <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and intraluminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was causing mass effect and continued <z:hpo ids='HP_0002512'>brainstem compression</z:hpo>, a decompressive procedure was required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: After the endovascular trapping, the patient underwent a completely endoscopic transnasal surgical clipping and aneurysmorrhaphy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After exposure of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, distal and proximal clips were applied transnasal, and the aneurysmorrhaphy completed using suction and ultrasonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In consideration of their surrounding regional <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the vertebral artery present a formidable surgical challenge to the neurosurgeon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although endovascular techniques have proven to be extremely valuable for the treatment of these lesions, they are limited when patients have significant mass effect with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002512'>brainstem compression</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010266" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cranial neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Advances in endoscopic transnasal surgery have provided an additional approach for the treatment of these difficult lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This case report represents, to our knowledge, the first literature report of a transnasal endoscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping and thrombectomy </plain></SENT>
