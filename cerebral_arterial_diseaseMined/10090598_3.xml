<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to study the relationship between cerebral blood flow (CBF) responses to induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> and to <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> inhalation in patients with occlusive disease of the carotid or middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 13 patients (8 men, 5 women) aged 31-73 years (mean +/- 1 SD = 63.2 +/- 10.6), regional CBF values during the resting state (CBFrest), 7% <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> inhalation (CBFhypercapnia), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> induced by 10-20 microg/kg/min intravenous trimethaphan (CBFhypotension) were measured using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi>-emission tomography (PET) with H2(15)O </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The % CBF change during induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (% CBFhypotension) was defined as (CBFhypotension - CBFrest)/CBFrest multiplied by 100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The % CBF change during <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> inhalation (% CBFhypercapnia) was defined as (CBFhypercapnia - CBFrest)/CBFrest/mm Hg arterial partial pressure of <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> x 100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We defined symptomatic hemispheres as those with a stenotic or occlusive lesion with neurological symptoms or signs and asymptomatic hemispheres as those which had a similar lesion and/or were influenced by the collateral flow pattern without neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the territory of the occlusive lesion, % CBFhypotension correlated significantly with % CBFhypercapnia (r = 0.793, P &lt; 0.002) in the symptomatic hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the brain regions in which trimethaphan did not induce a reduction in CBF. % CBFhypercapnia was 6.13 +/- 1.79 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In those in which % CBFhypotension ranged from 0 to -5, from -5 to -10, and more than -10%, % CBFhypercapnia was 4.05 +/- 1.99, 3.21 +/- 1.17, and 1.73 +/- 1.61, respectively, with significant differences between each pair of groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the asymptomatic hemispheres, % CBFhypotension also correlated with % CBFhypercapnia (r = 0.979, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Failure to maintain CBF during induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> was associated with diminished cerebrovascular vasoreactivity to <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This may indicate that failure of autoregulation can be assessed by the CBF response to both induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> inhalation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>From the technical point of view, estimation of the <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> response may be useful for assessing failure of autoregulation </plain></SENT>
