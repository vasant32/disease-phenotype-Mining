<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to examine the frequency and clinical relevance of intracranial artery stenoses in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> in whom the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has angiographically been reported to be associated with stenoses or occlusions of the large basal cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-five unselected patients (24 men, 11 women; mean age, 51 +/- 18 years) with <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> (n = 33) or fungal (n = 2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> prospectively underwent serial transcranial Doppler sonography recordings of mean blood velocity (MBV) and pulsatility index in the middle (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and anterior (ACA) cerebral arteries, as well as recordings of the ratio of the MBV of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and internal carotid artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>/ICA ratio) on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 14, and 21 after admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results were correlated with the Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale (days 1 to 14), the occurrence of focal cerebral signs, and the Glasgow Outcome Scale (short-term outcome, day 21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis was diagnosed by an MBV of 120 cm/s or more or an <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>/ICA ratio of more than 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An ACA stenosis was diagnosed by an MBV of 100 cm/s or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Transient stenoses occurred most frequently between days 3 and 5 and were detected in 18 patients (51%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients remained without a stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with stenoses showed a significantly poorer mean Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score from day 3 (9 +/- 4) to day 14 (11 +/- 4) than patients without a stenosis (day 3: 13 +/- 4, P &lt; .01 by t test; day 14: 14 +/- 1, P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean Glasgow Outcome Scale score was not significantly different between both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of mainly transient focal cerebral signs was significantly related to the number of narrowed vessels per patient (P &lt; .05, chi 2 test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Stenoses of the intracranial arteries occur frequently in <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> and are associated with a complicated course of the disease </plain></SENT>
