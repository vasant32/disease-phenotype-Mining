<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The model produces severe cortical dysfunction and cerebral blood flow deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of treatment was assessed using median nerve somatosensory cortical evoked potentials (CEP), [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrene autoradiographic cerebral blood flow studies, brain water content, and various physiological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A direct comparison of modified U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Navy Treatment Tables 6 and 6A is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complete recovery of CEP was not seen after 90 min of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The maximum rate of CEP recovery occurred in the first 15 min of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recovery continued out to 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, some dogs on treatment 6A showed signs of deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cerebral blood flow studies were the same in both groups and showed no sign of pathologically low levels of flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It appeared that there was no advantage in preceding 2.8-bar (60-ft) oxygen treatments with compression to 6 bar (165 ft) on air for the treatment of arterial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> in this model </plain></SENT>
