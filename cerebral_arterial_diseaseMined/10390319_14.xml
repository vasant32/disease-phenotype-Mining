<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced MRI was performed in 66 patients and 33 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients had severe stenosis (&gt;70%, n=12), unilateral occlusion (n=38), or bilateral occlusion (n=16) of the internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebripetal flow and collateral flow via the circle of Willis were investigated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Collateral flow via the ophthalmic artery was investigated with transcranial Doppler sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with ICA stenosis had well-preserved cerebral perfusion and were in general not dependent on collateral supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with unilateral ICA occlusion had impaired cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, appearance time, peak time, and mean transit time in white matter were less increased in patients with than in patients without collateral flow via the circle of Willis (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients with collateral flow via both anterior and posterior communicating arteries had less increased regional cerebral blood volume than patients with collateral flow via the posterior communicating artery only (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with bilateral ICA occlusion had severely compromised hemodynamic status despite recruitment of collateral supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with unilateral ICA occlusion, the pattern of collateral supply has significant influence on hemodynamic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Collateral flow via the anterior communicating artery is a sign of well-preserved hemodynamic status, whereas no collateral flow via the circle of Willis or flow via only the posterior communicating artery is a sign of deteriorated cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
