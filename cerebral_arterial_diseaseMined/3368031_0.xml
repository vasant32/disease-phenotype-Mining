<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using helical strips of the middle cerebral arteries (M2), the changes in muscular tension during an isometric contraction induced by either Oxy-Hb, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi>), high <z:chebi fb="3" ids="29103">potassium-ion</z:chebi>-Tyrode (30 mM K+), <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha), or carbocyclic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> (cTXA2) were recorded on the polygraph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blocking effects of nicardipine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8430">procaine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> were compared on the contractions produced by each reagent described above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results obtained are summarized as follows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>1) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> dissolved in different concentrations produced arterial contractions similar to those by equimolar Oxy-Hb, showing similar dose-response curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, equimolar met-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Met-Hb) always produced much weaker contractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the equimolar <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> was applied during an Oxy-Hb-induced contraction, the response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> was completely occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> was applied during a Met-Hb-induced contraction, the response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> was not occluded and always additive to the response to Met-Hb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">Indomethacin</z:chebi> blocked both responses to Oxy-Hb and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi>, showing similar dose dependence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>2) The above results suggested that Oxy-Hb induced contraction consisted of two components; a strong contraction by active oxygen within Hb molecule, and a weak contraction by Hb molecule itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The former may be mediated by some PG's which are produced inside the muscle cells as the results of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> release and subsequent cyclooxygenase activation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
