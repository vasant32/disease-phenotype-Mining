<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgical removal of the occlusive pellet was achieved in one patient, and vessel patency was restored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient recovered from his neurological deficit without surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Factors such as the availability of a microvascular surgeon, the status of the neurological deficit resulting from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>, the time interval from injury to the proposed operation, and the extent of ancillary injuries sustained concurrently <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> bear weight on the decision to explore surgically or treat by medical measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We believe that in cases of trauma an attempt to remove intravascular emboli is warranted to prevent migration of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> and distal propagation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, to avoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, to prevent arterial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath>, and to restore the integrity of the vascular tree </plain></SENT>
