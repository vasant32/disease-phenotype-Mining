<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2) immunoreactivity sections aligned with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images in the same coronal plane were used to map the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and to guide region-of-interest selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In ischemic cortex, the larger T1 increase in PT versus MCAT (42+/-7% vs. 16+/-5%) is related to the different character of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> between these models; yet, neither CBF nor ADCtr discriminated between them at 3.5 h, suggesting that different mechanisms of ischemic damage to the brain cells resulted in the same ADCtr value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CBF and ADCtr were depressed in immediately adjacent ischemic border by 27+/-7% and 47+/-10%, respectively, in MCAT but not in PT, suggesting marginal perfusion in MCAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CBF in homotopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cortex in the opposite hemisphere was higher for PT compared with MCAT (199+/-20 and 134+/-10 ml/100 g/min, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Different pathological processes in the two models affect CBF, ADCtr and T1 in a unique, regionally specific manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The PT model differs substantially from the MCAT and is not a model of cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with an appreciable border zone </plain></SENT>
