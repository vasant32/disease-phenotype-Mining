<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: While the combination of an angiotensin receptor blocker with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50264">thiazide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> produces a clinically beneficial reduction in blood pressure in patients who otherwise only partially respond to monotherapy with an angiotensin receptor blocker, blood pressure-lowering therapy with combination <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drug</z:chebi> regimens in patients with cerebral hemodynamic impairment may adversely affect cerebral hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present exploratory study was to determine whether blood pressure-lowering therapy with the combination of the angiotensin receptor blocker <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> plus hydrochlorothiazide (LPH) worsens brain perfusion in patients with both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and cerebral hemodynamic impairment due to symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> major cerebral artery steno-occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi>-resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and reduced cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> due to symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> internal carotid artery (ICA) or middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) steno-occlusive disease were prospectively entered into the present study and received 50 mg/day of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> plus 12.5 mg/day of hydrochlorothiazideat 14 weeks after the last ischemic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and CVR were measured before and 12 weeks after initiating LPH using N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-p-[(123)I]-iodoamphetamine single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A region of interest (ROI) was automatically placed in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory on each SPECT image using a three-dimensional stereotactic ROI template </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: None of the 18 patients who participated in the study experienced any new neurological symptoms or adverse effects related to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Systolic (p &lt; 0.001) and diastolic (p &lt; 0.001) blood pressures were significantly reduced after the administration of LPH, with average reductions of 11 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure and 10 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While in the affected hemisphere CBF did not differ between measurements taken before and after the administration of LPH, CVR was significantly higher after the administration of LPH than before (p = 0.007) and was significantly improved in 5 of 18 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the contralateral hemisphere, CBF and CVR did not differ between measurements taken before and after the administration of LPH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no patients who experienced a significant deterioration in CBF or CVR in the affected or contralateral hemisphere after the administration of LPH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the present study was exploratory and its results were preliminary due to the small sample size, the current data suggest that blood pressure-lowering therapy with LPH apparently does not result in worsening of cerebral hemodynamics in patients with both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and cerebral hemodynamic impairment due to symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ICA or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> steno-occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
