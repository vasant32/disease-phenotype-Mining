<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, quantification of perfusion may depend on the choice of the arterial input function (AIF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using quantitative <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography we evaluated the influence of the AIF location on maps of absolute and relative perfusion-weighted imaging to detect penumbral flow (PF; &lt;20 mL/100 g/min on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography(CBF)) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 22 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> the AIF was placed at 7 sites (M1, M2, M3 ipsi- and contralateral and internal carotid artery-M1 contralateral to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparative (15)O-water <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography and AIF-dependent perfusion-weighted imaging (cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, mean transit time, and time to maximum) were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis described the threshold independent performance (area under the curve) of the perfusion-weighted maps for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7 AIF locations and identified the best AIF-dependent absolute and relative thresholds to identify PF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results were compared with AIF-independent time-to-peak maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Quantitative perfusion-weighted imaging maps of cerebral blood flow and time to maximum performed best </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For PF detection, AIF placement did significantly influence absolute PF thresholds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, AIF placement did not influence (1) the threshold independent performance; and (2) the relative PF thresholds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>AIF placement in the proximal segment of the contralateral middle cerebral artery (cM1) was preferable for quantification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AIF-based maps of cerebral blood flow and time to maximum were most accurate to detect the PF threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The AIF placement significantly altered absolute PF thresholds and showed best agreement with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography for the cM1 segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The performance of relative PF thresholds, however, was not AIF location-dependent and might be along with AIF-independent time-to-peak maps, more suitable than absolute PF thresholds in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> if detailed postprocessing is not feasible </plain></SENT>
