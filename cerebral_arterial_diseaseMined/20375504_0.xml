<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with white matter lesions (WML) may be more vulnerable to a decrease in cerebral blood flow (CBF) due to an impaired autoregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association between CBF and cognitive performance and whether WML modified this relation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Within the SMART-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> study, a cohort study among patients with manifest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e>, cross-sectional analyses were performed in 472 patients (mean age 57 +/- 10 years, 77% male) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total CBF was measured with magnetic resonance angiography in the internal carotid arteries and basilar artery, and was expressed per 100 ml brain volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological tests assessing executive functioning and memory were performed and composite scores were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We used linear regression analyses, adjusted for age, sex, education and intelligence, to investigate the association between CBF and cognitive performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that WML modified the association between CBF and executive functioning (p for interaction &lt;0.001); the association between lower CBF and worse performance on executive functioning became stronger and significant with increasing volumes of WML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lower CBF was not associated with worse memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that a combination of lower CBF and WML may impair executive functioning but not memory </plain></SENT>
