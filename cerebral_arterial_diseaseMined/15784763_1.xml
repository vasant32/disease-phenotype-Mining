<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to validate the accuracy and criteria of transcranial color-coded sonography (TCCS) in detecting severe middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred ninety-three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic cerebrovascular disease who received both TCCS and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) examinations were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> assessed by MRA was graded as follows: grade 0, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> to mild (&lt; 50%); grade 1, focal severe stenosis (&gt; or = 50% and stenotic length within the M1 prebifurcation segment); and grade 2, diffuse severe stenosis (&gt; or = 50% and stenotic length greater than the M1 prebifurcation segment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The peak systolic velocity (Vs) and mean velocity (Vm) of bilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> were obtained by TCCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Estimates of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy were calculated for TCCS relative to MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 46 patients were excluded, 309 MCAs (grade 0, 77.3%; grade 1, 15.5%; and grade 2, 7.1%) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The optimal diagnostic accuracy of TCCS for the detection of grade 1 MCA stenosis can be reached if Vs is 140 cm/s or higher or Vm is 90 cm/s or higher (sensitivity, 83.3%; specificity, 91.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The optimal diagnostic accuracy of grade 2 MCA stenosis can be obtained if V(s) is lower than 50 cm/s or V(s) is 140 cm/s or higher (sensitivity, 81.8%; specificity, 92.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In our study, none of the grade 1 but around half of the grade 2 stenosis showed a low flow velocity pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transcranial color-coded sonography is reliable in detecting severe <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Except for high flow velocity, the addition of a low cutoff of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> flow velocity in our criteria not only increases the study sensitivity but also enables the identification of around half of diffuse severe <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
