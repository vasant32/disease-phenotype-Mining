<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The experimental model utilized has been widely applied to the study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and possibly has relevance to clamps applied to the cerebral vessels during neurosurgical treatment of patients with cerebrovascular disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The earliest changes within the arterial wall were found in the smooth muscle (media) and accompanying fasciculi of nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes within the nerve bundles were sufficiently advances following 4 hours of vascular clipping to suggest temporary or permanent impairment of neurogenic innervation of the cerebral vessels distal to the trunk of the vessel clipped </plain></SENT>
