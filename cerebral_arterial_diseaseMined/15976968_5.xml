<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) is relatively ineffective in patients with large vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Numerous experimental studies have demonstrated that ultrasound (US) can accelerate enzymatic fibrinolysis and acceleration of lysis by US is enhanced in the presence of microbubbles used as echo-contrast agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of continuous monitoring of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) recanalization using transcranial color-coded sonography (TCCS) and intravenously administered microbubbles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Recanalization of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) mainstem occlusion was assessed using continuous monitoring with TCCS and intravenously administered <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi>-based microbubbles (Levovist) in 8 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> treated with intravenous rt-PA within 3 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recanalization at one hour occurred in 4 of 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median NIHSS score was 21 (range 10 to 28) at baseline, 15 (range 0 to 24) at 1 h, and 11 (range 0 to 22) at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformation (HT) was demonstrated on brain imaging in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the feasibility of continuous monitoring of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> recanalization using TCCS and Levovist, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest a high rate of asymptomatic HT in monitored patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> HTs were asymptomatic and did not preclude early clinical improvement, particular attention should be given to the incidence and clinical significance of HT in future studies using these methods </plain></SENT>
