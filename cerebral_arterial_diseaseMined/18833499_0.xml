<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the last decade transcranial color-coded sonography (TCCS) was established as a routine in neurovascular departments for the evaluation of brain-supplying vessels in cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TCCS has demonstrated feasibility and validity for the evaluation of the basal cerebral arteries, especially for the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In some patients an insufficient bone window may limit the diagnostic power </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The application of microbubble agents can overcome this limitation in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Beside the demonstration of vessel pathology such as stenosis and occlusion, TCCS also provides prognostic information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the case of proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion shown by TCCS within 6 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, nearly 90 % of the patients suffered an unfavorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore TCCS is suitable for monitoring thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to detect whether there is recanalization of the affected vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The possibility for bedside examination, the non-invasiveness and the cost-effectiveness are features which make TCCS an optimal tool for the evaluation of cerebral vessels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
