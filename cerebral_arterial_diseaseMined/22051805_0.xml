<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There are only a few reports on the feasibility and safety of stents used in the PICA, and clinical and angiographic follow-up results have not been fully addressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our experiences of treating PICA origin or vertebral artery-PICA lesions by using self-expanding stents as adjuvant or rescue therapy with angiographic and clinical follow-up results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six patients were treated with self-expanding stent placements from the vertebral artery to the PICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients had a vertebral artery dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> involving the PICA origin, 3 had vertebral artery-PICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and 1 had segmental stenosis of the vertebral artery harboring the origin of the PICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The safety, feasibility, and follow-up angiographic results were retrospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> procedures were successfully performed without any procedure-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the patients showed PICA territorial infarction on DWI posttreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were neurologically intact during the clinical follow-up of 3-24 months following the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up angiography was performed at between 6 and 12 months in 5 of the 6 patients and was scheduled for the sixth patient but was not performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The PICA showed good patency without in-stent stenosis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with lesions of the PICA origin or vertebral artery-PICA lesions, vertebral artery-to-PICA stent placement may be an option for preserving PICA patency in selected cases </plain></SENT>
