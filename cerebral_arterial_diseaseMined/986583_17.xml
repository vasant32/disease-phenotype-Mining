<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One hundred eleven patients with supratentorial cerebrovascular disease were studied by computerized axial tomography (CT scanning) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With one exception, every patient who had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> scan 48 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms was ultimately diagnosed as having had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, although in nearly one-third, the clinical diagnoses at the time of the scan was infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CT scan, therefore, augurs a good outcome of supratentorial cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ninety-eight percent of the patients with infarction had abnormal scans, with areas of decreased density in a vascular distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pitfalls in the diagnosis of infarction were (1) initially <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CT scans that changed to abnormal after 48 hours, and (2) mass effect of infarction leading to misdiagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumor</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serial studies eliminated both pitfalls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>Intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> had a distinctive high density appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 43 percent of patients whose scans showed <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, the clinical diagnosis was <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Many did not have symptoms, signs, or outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and the diagnosis would not have been suspect were it not for the CT scan </plain></SENT>
