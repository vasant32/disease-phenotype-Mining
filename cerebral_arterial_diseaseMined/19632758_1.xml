<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Vascular enhancement technology (VET) is a new form of ultrasonographic technology that can optimize images by enhancing the B-mode display with information derived from power Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We designed an in vitro model to evaluate the accuracy and application method of VET and to apply this technology preliminarily in vivo in the vascular periphery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An in vitro model was designed with a flow pump system to simulate blood flow in soft tissue and the intracranial vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Modeling vessels were imaged by traditional B mode, color Doppler flow imaging and VET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the various silicon tubes was measured to verify the accuracy of VET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For in vivo application, 15 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and 26 patients suspected of having carotid artery plaques and cerebrovascular disease were examined using these three image modes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The imaging effects were observed and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>VET imaging could clarify the lumens of the modeling vessels and reduce artifacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The caliber of three sizes of silicon tubing was also measured accurately by VET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 15 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, sound artifacts in large vessels were inhibited and the intermedia membrane was clearly displayed by VET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The boundaries of carotid plaques were manifested by VET with well-defined edges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three cases of hypoechoic soft plaque on the anterior wall missed in B-mode imaging were detected by VET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Intracranial scanning with VET identified cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, including cerebral stenosis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The size and shape of the focus displayed by VET coincided with that observed using digital subtraction arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>VET is helpful in improving detection of the boundary of vessels and visualization of the microvasculature </plain></SENT>
