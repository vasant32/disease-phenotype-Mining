<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These 11 patients represented 2.2% of our patients and 5% of those less than 20 yr of age which is frequent in relation to lesions of the same type having a different topography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical and EEG studies of these 11 patients revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> in 8 cases, hemianopsia in 7 cases, a severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">partial epilepsy</z:e> in 6 cases which was temporal in 5 patients, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086238" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary generalized epilepsy</z:e> in 3 cases, and an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> unable to be classified in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The "<z:hpo ids='HP_0002132'>porencephalies</z:hpo>" responsible for these clinical signs are most likely of encephalomalacic origin, secondary to circulatory troubles in the peri- or postnatal period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Remillard et al. maintain that perinatal occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery is responsible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in our personal series, the results obtained from CT, <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> and angiography do not permit us to be as affirmative as to the vascular etiology responsible </plain></SENT>
