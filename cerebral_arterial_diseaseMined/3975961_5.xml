<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RCBF was measured by the microsphere method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In control animals (n = 3), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> (4 mg/kg, i.v.) significantly reduced rCBF by about 25% in both cortex (from 44 +/- 6 to 32 +/- 3 ml/100 g/min, p less than 0.001) and white matter (from 36 +/- 4 to 26 +/- 2 ml/100 g/min, p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion rCBF was markedly decreased in the sylvian region ipsilateral to occlusion (ischemic core) (from 38 +/- 4 to 14 +/- 2 ml/100 g/min in cortex, 4 animals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> (4 mg/kg) (4 animals) 30 min prior to occlusion did not alter rCBF during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, a marked enhancement of reactive hyperemia was observed in the ischemic core immediately upon reperfusion following 2 h occlusion (54 +/- 11 untreated vs 95 +/- 13 treated, p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the delayed postischemic period, namely 2 h after recirculation, rCBF still remained to be higher in the animals treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> (40 +/- 6 untreated vs 96 +/- 9 treated, p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such an effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> for ameliorating postischemic blood flow in both the immediate and delayed period was less prominent in the adjacent area (penumbra) ipsilateral to occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the contralateral hemisphere, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> caused slight reduction in rCBF during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
