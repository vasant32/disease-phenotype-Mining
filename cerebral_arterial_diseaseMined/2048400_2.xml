<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They comprise a subgroup of 101 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> less than or equal to 75 years of age, admitted within 72 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography and CT-scan were performed within 1-2 days of admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT-scan was repeated 6 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional status on admission, 3 and 6 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was evaluated using the Rankin disability scale (score 1-2: independent of others care, score 3-5: dependent on others care) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> was measured using the Medical Research Council's score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirteen had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> with a diameter less than or equal to 3 cm (mean 2.5 +/- 0.9 cm); 15 had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> greater than 3 cm (mean 6.3 +/- 1.4 cm); 10 had trunk occlusions; 18 had branch occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusions with large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> on admission carried a poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eleven (85%) of 13 patients with the case in only 1 (7%) of the 15 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> greater than 3 cm, the remaining 14 (93%) had either died (40%) or were dependent (53%) (p less than 0.00005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eleven (85%) of 13 patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> on admission were independent, while 13 (87%) of 15 with moderate or severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> on admission had either died (40%) or were dependent on others' care (47%) 6 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (p less than 0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Type of occlusion (branch trunk) was a poor predictor of outcome </plain></SENT>
