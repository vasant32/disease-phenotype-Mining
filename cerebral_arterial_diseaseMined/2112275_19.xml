<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using an immunoblotting technique, we investigated changes in the concentrations of microtubule-associated protein 2, 200-kDa neurofilament, tubulin, myelin-associated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>, and 2':3'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23447">cyclic nucleotide</z:chebi> 3'-phosphodiesterase in the brains of 40 rats following occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery or sham operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Compared with those 4 hours after surgery, concentrations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> proteins decreased significantly in the left hemisphere 3 days after surgery (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microtubule-associated protein 2 was the most susceptible to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and its mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> concentration decreased to 23 +/- 9.4% of that in concurrent sham-operated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Degradation products of microtubule-associated protein 2 and myelin-associated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> were detected on the blots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in the contralateral hemisphere (where calpain might be activated), concentrations of these two proteins decreased to 57 +/- 12.0% and 83 +/- 4.3% of those in concurrent sham-operated controls, respectively, 3 days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes in the concentrations of cerebral proteins in the contralateral hemisphere are important for understanding clinical symptoms not attributable solely to the ipsilateral lesion following a focal cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
