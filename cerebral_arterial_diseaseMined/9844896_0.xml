<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Effects were studied of the drug preparation "Tanakan" on the process of the rehabilitation of those patients (n = 150) operated on for abnormalities and deformity of brain major arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two groups were identified: pathologies of the vertebral arteries (n = 50), carotid abnormalities (n = 51), control groups (n = 24 and 25 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The drug was administered in a dose of 40 mg on a three-times daily schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical approaches were used as were the dopplerographic, electroencephalographic, biochemical, micromorphological, neuropsychological methods of investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Determined in the study was a positive dynamics of clinical indices, which was more apparent for vertebrobasilar discirculations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EEG-investigation revealed differences in the course of changes in left- and right-hemispheric location of carotidogenous discirculations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increase in blood serum <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity was recorded as was a positive transformation of vegetative indices and improvement of cognitive functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the use of the above drug is indicated in the postoperative complex of rehabilitative measures in patients with cerebrovascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> secondary to developmental anomalies and deformities of brain major arteries </plain></SENT>
