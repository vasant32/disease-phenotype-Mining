<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the true impact of dispersion upon cerebral blood flow (CBF) quantification by removing an algorithm implementation-induced systematic error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The impact of dispersion on the arterial input function (AIF) between measurement and entry into the tissue of interest on CBF estimates was simulated assuming: 1) contralateral circulation flow that introduces a true arterial tissue delay (ATD)-related dispersive component; and 2) the presence of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> that disperses and shifts the AIF peak entering the tissue; increasing the apparent ATD relative to the original AIF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Previously reported CBF estimates for the stenosis dispersion model were found to be a mixture of true dispersive effects and an algorithm implementation-induced systematic error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The true CBF(MEASURED)/CBF(NO-DISPERSION) ratios for short mean transit times (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) and long <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> (infarcted) tissue were similar for both dispersion models evaluated; this was an unanticipated result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CBF quantification inaccuracies induced through the dispersion model truly related to ATD were lower than for the local stenosis-based dispersion for small ATD values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Correcting the systematic error present in a previous deconvolution study removes the reported ATD-related impact on CBF quantification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The impact of dispersion was smaller than half that reported in previous simulation studies </plain></SENT>
