<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to investigate the role of sensory C-fibers in myogenic responsiveness of cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Arterial diameter and intraluminal pressure were simultaneously measured in vitro on rat posterior cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cerebral arteries constricted in response to graded increase in intraluminal pressure (20-100 mmHg, in 20 mmHg increments) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro C-fiber desensitization with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi> (1 micromol/l, 20 minutes) significantly suppressed myogenic constriction by over 50%, but did not affect 5-hydroxytryptamine (0.01-10 micromol/l) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> (120 mmol/l)-induced constriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Capsazepine (5 micromol/l, 30 minutes), a selective blocker of neuronal vanilloid receptor TRPV1, had similar inhibitory effect on cerebral myogenic constriction to elevated pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebral myogenic constriction was significantly attenuated by H/R; the impairment by H/R was further enhanced after C-fiber desensitization (except at a pressure level of 100 mmHg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: These findings indicate that C-fiber activity contributes to myogenic constriction of cerebral arteries under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and H/R conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>H/R-impaired myogenic responsiveness is exaggerated by C-fiber dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results raise the possibility that therapeutic strategies directed toward preserving C-fiber nerve endings or supplying its constituent neuropeptides could be developed </plain></SENT>
