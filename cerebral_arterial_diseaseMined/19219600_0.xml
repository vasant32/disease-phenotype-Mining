<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study aimed to retrospectively analyze a series of patients with complex posterior circulation stenosis who underwent stent-assisted angioplasty to evaluate the feasibility of the procedure and summarize the experience with regard to complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 16 consecutive patients with 27 complex posterior circulation artery stenoses refractory to medical therapy were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Technical success rate, periprocedural complication, and long-term follow-up result were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study population included 16 patients with 27 lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 36 stents were successfully implanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The technical success rate was 100%, and the overall periprocedural complication rate was 12.5% (2/16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During a median of 25.5 months of follow-up, three patients presented recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, which were confirmed had restenosis more than 50% by control angiography or transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Stent-assisted angioplasty is a feasible treatment method for complex posterior circulation <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, it appears to be associated with a relatively high periprocedural complication rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, strict periprocedural management to reduce mortality and morbidity is needed </plain></SENT>
