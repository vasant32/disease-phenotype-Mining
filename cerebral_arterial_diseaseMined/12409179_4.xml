<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was carried out in 53 patients who had a unilateral occlusion or severe stenosis of their cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Asymmetry index (AI) was used to determine relative CBF distribution on each SPECT image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DeltaAI (regional vasodilatory capacity) values were compared with the values of several PET parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also repeated SPECT and PET studies in 15 patients after a mean interval of 2.6 years from entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The correlation between changes in DeltaAI and PET data were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The DeltaAI value closely correlated with the ipsilateral OEF value (r=-0.64, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity-specificity curve analysis revealed that the optimal cut-off value for detecting Stage II hemodynamic failure was -13.5% of DeltaAI, at which point the diagnostic accuracy was 82% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In follow-up studies, changes in DeltaAI correlated significantly with changes in OEF values (r=-0.68, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Semiquantitative SPECT examination with ACZ challenge detects Stage II hemodynamic failure with a diagnostic accuracy of 82% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An improvement in reduced vasodilatory capacity as determined by SPECT coincides with a reduction in OEF values </plain></SENT>
