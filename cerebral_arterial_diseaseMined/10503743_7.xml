<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pathologic examination shows multiple small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the deep cerebral white matter together with a nonatherosclerotic, nonamyloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> involving the media of small cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructurally, characteristic granular material is present in the basal lamina of vascular smooth muscle cells in cerebral and extracerebral blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ultrastructural changes have also been demonstrated in skin biopsies of affected patients; consequently, some investigators have recently recommended skin biopsies for the diagnosis of CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study describes a 54-year-old male with a family history for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> who had clinical and radiological features suggestive of CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A skin biopsy was performed to confirm the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Initially, the characteristic vasculopathic changes of CADASIL were not identified within small blood vessel walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, multiple deeper sections in other areas showed electron-dense material associated with vascular smooth muscle cells, characteristic of CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subsequent genetic testing demonstrated a single nucleotide substitution at position 659 on chromosome 19p13.1 causing an amino-acid change (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29950,32737">Cys --</z:chebi>&gt; Phe), a finding indicative of CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The involvement of blood vessels within the dermis makes skin biopsy a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, as illustrated by this case, the findings may be focal, requiring a thorough evaluation of the entire biopsy specimen </plain></SENT>
