<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms leading to shunting through a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> include high right-sided cardiac pressures and respiratory factors due to mechanical ventilation and also anatomical changes in the right atrium as described in the platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a patient with the adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e>) who had a right-to-left atrial shunt which decreased in the prone position, after which oxygenation improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> due to an invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paradoxical embolisms</z:e> through a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite mechanical ventilation and antifungal treatment he developed severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He was therefore turned to the prone position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood gas values improved dramatically (arterial oxygen tension/fractional inspired oxygen ratio increasing from 59 to 278 torr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler sonography was performed with bubble study, which confirmed a massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> in the supine position and which instantaneously decreased in the prone position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This case suggests that a decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> in patients who have a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> could partly explain the improvement in hypoxemia in the prone position </plain></SENT>
