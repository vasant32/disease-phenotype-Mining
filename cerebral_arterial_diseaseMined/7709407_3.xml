<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: At neuropathological examination, the territory of the anterior choroidal artery is frequently found to be involved in massive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of the internal carotid artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to analyze the clinical spectrum, the course, and the mechanism of these massive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> compared with the rare <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> involving only the anterior choroidal artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective clinical examination and pathological study were performed in 35 patients with cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> affecting at least the territory of the anterior choroidal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In no patient had the involvement of the anterior choroidal territory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> been recognized clinically, nor had the triad of clinical signs (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>, hemianesthesia, and hemianopsia) classically seen in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> restricted to this territory been found alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Impairment of consciousness, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009241" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disorders</z:e>, or oculomotor palsies had been found in addition to one or more signs of the triad </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was probably related to the involvement of other territories (94%), especially the middle cerebral artery territory (68%) and the posterior cerebral artery territory (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The concomitant involvement of several territories was due most frequently to an occlusion of the internal carotid artery, which was found at autopsy in 74% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These occlusions were often associated with cardioembolism (54%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, artery-to-artery embolism (17%) and small-artery disease (6%) were seldom found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only two cases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> restricted to the anterior choroidal artery territory were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The involvement of the territory of the anterior choroidal artery in massive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was due mainly to a cardioembolic occlusion of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
