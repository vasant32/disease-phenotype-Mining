<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined 24 patients with unilateral occlusive lesions of a major cerebral artery using the 133Xe inhalation technique and single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured during a resting state, during inhalation of 5% <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi>, and 15 minutes after the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> consecutively in the same patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Normative values of resting CBF and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> reactivity were obtained in 21 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with the exception of 1 showed an increase in CBF during <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> ipsilateral to the occlusive lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> reactivity was preserved in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, 11 patients showed an absent response or paradoxical CBF reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity did not correlate with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> reactivity when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 24 patients were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there was a significant correlation between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> in the 13 patients who showed preserved <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> reactivity (r = .60, P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was present in the remaining 11 patients with reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although significant blood pressure augmentation was observed in <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp>, we could not find a correlation between change of blood pressure and <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">Acetazolamide</z:chebi> identified patients with reduced vasomotor reactivity who appeared to have preserved <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">Acetazolamide</z:chebi> testing may be useful in the assessment of cerebral hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, further investigations are necessary to assess the clinical utility of these tests </plain></SENT>
