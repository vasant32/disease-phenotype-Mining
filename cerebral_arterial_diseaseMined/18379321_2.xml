<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Parasagittal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo> (PSM) may pose a difficult surgical challenge because venous patency and collateral anastomoses have to be clearly defined for correct surgical planning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to study the diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography venography (CTV) in assessing the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) obstruction and venous collaterals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four patients undergoing surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo> located adjacent to the SSS were prospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients underwent both conventional computed tomography examination and CTV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography venography was evaluated by 2 expert neuroradiologists to assess (1) patency of the sinus (patent/occluded), (2) the extent of occlusion (in centimeters), and (3) the number of collateral anastomoses close to the insertion of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography venography assessment was compared with surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were operated on, and intraoperative findings were taken as the criterion standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Computed tomography venography showed the sinus to be occluded in 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography venography data were confirmed by surgery, showing 6 patients to have have an occlusion of the SSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The CTV sensitivity was thus 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography venography depicted 83% of collateral venous anastomoses close to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> as subsequently confirmed by surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the preoperative planning for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo> located close to the SSS, CTV can provide additional and more reliable information concerning venous infiltration and the presence of collateral anastomoses compared with noncontrast computed tomography </plain></SENT>
