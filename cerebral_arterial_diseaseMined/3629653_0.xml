<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This investigation evaluates the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> angiographic contrast medium administration on the cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> induced by middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixteen rats underwent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, and after 1 hour half the rats underwent ipsilateral internal carotid injection of meglumine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53691">diatrizoate</z:chebi>, whereas the remainder underwent cervical internal carotid exposure only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six rats had only sham operations on the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and internal carotid, and 4 other rats served as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cortical specific gravity was measured to reflect <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> 4 hours after occlusion or sham operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specific gravity of the lateral frontal cortex in the hemisphere ipsilateral to occlusion was 1.0396 +/- 0.0011 (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) when no angiographic contrast medium was administered, significantly less (p less than 0.01) than in rats exposed to contrast medium (specific gravity 1.0442 +/- 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The latter value was not significantly different from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other cortical areas on the side of the contrast medium injection were also relatively dehydrated compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early meglumine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53691">diatrizoate</z:chebi> administration after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion results in a decrease in cerebral cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, possible by inducing an osmotic gradient that draws water from the extravascular space </plain></SENT>
