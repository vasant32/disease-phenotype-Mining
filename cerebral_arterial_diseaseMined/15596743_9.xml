<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Intracranial arterial dolichoectasia (IADE) is defined as an increase in length and diameter of the intracranial arteries and is present in 12% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiology is unknown; some data suggest that IADE is not merely a complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, but a distinct <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> characterized by loss of elastic tissue in the media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between IADE and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) variables such as ascending and descending thoracic aorta diameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The sample included 154 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (BI) and with measurement of the descending thoracic aorta on TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IADE was diagnosed by consensus between two neurologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Information on demographic characteristics and risk factors was collected using a structured questionnaire, and a carotid ultrasound scan was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IADE was identified in 23 of the 154 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean diameter (+/-SD) of the descending thoracic aorta was significantly higher in the IADE(+) than in the 131 IADE(-) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (mean +/- SD 26.6 +/- 3.6 vs 24.8 +/- 2.7 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proportion of IADE increased regularly with the quartiles of descending thoracic aorta diameter: 5%, 13%, 18%, and 24% (test of linear trend, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The adjusted OR (95% CI) of IADE associated with a 1 mm increase in descending thoracic aorta diameter was 1.22 (95% CI, 1.02 to 1.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with intracranial arterial dolichoectasia (IADE) have larger descending thoracic aorta diameters than non-IADE patients, suggesting that the underlying process causing IADE also affects the descending thoracic aorta </plain></SENT>
