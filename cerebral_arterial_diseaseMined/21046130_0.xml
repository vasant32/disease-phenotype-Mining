<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the relationship between BAC on mammography and cerebral artery-origin T2-hyperintensity on brain MRI and which is associated with an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 168 women, ages 40-78 years, who underwent both mammography and brain MRI, were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BAC was counted as positive if it was found on more than one view a breast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The T2-hyperintensity was systemically defined and graded as follows: punctuate; patchy; and confluent white-matter hyperintensity (WMH); caps; bands; and irregular periventricular hyperintensity (PVH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patchy and confluent WMH and irregular PVH were considered as positive findings for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also obtained data regarding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> that might function as confounding factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed for association of the BAC and positive MRI findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULT: The presence of BAC showed a strong correlation with the positive MRI findings (Odds ratios, adjusted with statically significant cardiovascular factors of 6.86 for positive WMH and 9.04 for positive PVH, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The mammographic finding of BAC, which may be a useful marker of women at higher risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, should receive more of clinicians' attention and its presence should never be omitted from the report </plain></SENT>
