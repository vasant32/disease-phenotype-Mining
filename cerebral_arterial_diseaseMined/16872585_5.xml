<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is accumulating evidence that advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are relevant to the formation of vascular complications in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether AGEs have a significant effect on tissue factor (TF) expression in brain microvascular endothelial cells compared with that in other arterial endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cultured bovine brain microvascular endothelial cells (BBMECs) and aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were incubated in medium containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5445">glyceraldehyde</z:chebi>-derived AGE (glycer-AGE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, protein expression, and activity were measured at multiple time points after glycer-AGE incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the effect of glycer-AGE on TF expression was investigated by treatment with a free radical scavenger, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi>, and intracellular ROS measurements with dihydroethidium (DHE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Basic TF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was greater in BBMECs than in BAECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Glycer-AGE significantly upregulated TF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in both cells, and the upregulation was more prominent in BBMECs than in BAECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TF protein expression and activity were also upregulated with a pattern of being greater in BBMECs than in BAECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">Edaravone</z:chebi> significantly attenuated the AGE-induced upregulation of TF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, protein expression, and activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intracellular ROS levels measured with DHE-stained fluorescent intensity were significantly upregulated by glycer-AGE with a pattern of being greater in BBMECs than in BAECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>AGE-induced ROS upregulation was attenuated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> like AGE-induced TF upregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that brain microvascular endothelial cells are more susceptible to AGE-induced TF upregulation than aortic endothelial cells, and that this susceptibility is associated with levels of intracellular ROS </plain></SENT>
