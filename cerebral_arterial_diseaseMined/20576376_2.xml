<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the STA are not unusual and have been reported about more than 400 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of these were pseudoaneurysms caused by blunt trauma because of the anatomical location of STA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, spontaneous or non-traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the STA are quite rare and only 8 cases of spontaneous true <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in the STA have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Herein, we report a case of a 77-year-old woman, who presented with a preauricular mass showing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> enlargement over the previous two months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She had no history of head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Imaging studies demonstrated that the mass was a saccular type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> accompanied by afferent and efferent vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mass was resected under general anesthesia and there were no symptoms or signs of local circulatory deficiency, nor was there any interference with nerve function after the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pathological examination showed that the mass was a true <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The literature is reviewed and the management of the STA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is discussed </plain></SENT>
