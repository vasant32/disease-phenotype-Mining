<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The removal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002893'>pituitary adenoma</z:hpo> was carried out on her in 1982 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After that, 4500rad irradiation was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was about six years after irradiation that the first angiography was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, multiple stenosis of both ACAs and Moya-Moya like vessels were discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On admission light <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> on her left lower extremity was recognized and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was interesting that the multiple stenosis was found in an area outside the irradiation field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-STA anastomosis was performed and the prognosis was good </plain></SENT>
