<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> arising from the proximal portion of the anterior cerebral artery (A1: horizontal portion) are quite rare and are considered to be unique, because they are usually connected with other vascular anomalies and are sometimes part of a multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> cases experienced over the past seven and a half years are summarized in this paper </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 413 patients were surgically treated including 142 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH); the remaining 271 patients had unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among them, nine cases were categorized as constituent A1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, three with SAH and six with unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The shape of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was saccular in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nine cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of the nine cases had associated vascular malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> diameter in the three cases with SAH was 4.0 mm, which is smaller than other common <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> presenting with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> developed at the takeoff point of perforating arteries-the medial lenticulostriate artery in five cases and the recurrent artery of Heubner in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the remaining case, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> originated from the proximal end of the associated A1 fenestration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> nine patients had an excellent outcome after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> require surgical elimination even if they are small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We emphasize the importance of preserving the blood flow of these perforating arteries by avoiding compression with either the clip blade or the clip body itself </plain></SENT>
