<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study presents a group of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADPKD</z:e> who had intracranial arterial dolichoectasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred seventy-eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADPKD</z:e> patients were screened with magnetic resonance angiography, 40 ADPKD patients had conventional angiography, and 98 ADPKD patients underwent a brain autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For comparison, 360 patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADPKD</z:e> who had magnetic resonance angiography and conventional angiography or brain autopsy were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of asymptomatic intracranial arterial dolichoectasia was 2.2% (4 of 178), 2.5% (1 of 40), and 2.0% (2 of 98) in the three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADPKD</z:e> groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADPKD</z:e> had intracranial arterial dolichoectasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to the seven patients with asymptomatic disease, two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADPKD</z:e> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751572" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia</z:e> had posterior circulation ischemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the nine patients (five men and four women) was 56.6 yr (range, 41 to 67 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The posterior circulation was involved in five patients, the anterior circulation was involved in two patients, and both were involved in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>Arterial dissection</z:hpo> was believed to have caused middle cerebral artery dolichoectasia in one patient, and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissections</z:hpo> were strongly suspected in two other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six of the nine patients with intracranial arterial dolichoectasia had additional vascular manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADPKD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Some patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADPKD</z:e> are at an increased risk of developing intracranial arterial dolichoectasia and dissections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Recognizing this association is important because (1) it may be a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; (2) it may mimic a saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> on radiographic studies; and (3) it suggests that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADPKD</z:e> may be more generalized than previously believed </plain></SENT>
