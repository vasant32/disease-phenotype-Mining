<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were killed 3 days after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and administration of Evans blue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As compared to SD, the SHR had elevated blood pressure prior to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, large cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> marked with Evans blue, and motor deficits contralateral to the occluded <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SHR did not develop an adequate collateral circulation, but SD were protected from infarction by it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> were in young spontaneously hypertensive rats living prior to the established form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, the increased susceptibility to infarction was not secondary to it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since normotensive rats usually do not <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> after sudden <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, the infarction trait may be linked to the mechanism causing elevated blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
