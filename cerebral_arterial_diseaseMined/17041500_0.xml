<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To introduce a method for preoperative targeting of a proper recipient artery in superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six operations for superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery anastomosis in four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e>-like disease and two operations in two patients with atherosclerotic cerebrovascular occlusive disease accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0005145'>coronary artery stenosis</z:hpo> were performed using our method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before surgery, a 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging study was performed with axial T1-weighted three-dimensional magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo sequences and three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on quantitative regional cerebral blood flow were obtained by <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-123-labeled N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-iodoamphetamine single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography or <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The magnetic resonance angiography and regional cerebral blood flow data sets were registered with the magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo data set by means of the coregistration function of the SPM2 software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We examined the arteries located on or near the cortex where the regional cerebral blood flow had significantly decreased and used the coregistered data set and MRIcro software to select the cortical artery with the largest diameter as the target recipient artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the surgery, the data sets were applied to the neuronavigation system and the actual site of the target was confirmed in the operation before scalp incision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The superficial temporal artery was anastomosed with the target through a small craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Successful bypass surgery to the target was confirmed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The "target bypass" method might be effective for cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> or for cases requiring surgery through a small craniotomy </plain></SENT>
