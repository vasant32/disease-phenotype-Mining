<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-three patients with forty-five M1 stenoses, ranged from 50% to 99% in diameter reduction and refractory to medical therapy, were enrolled in this study between March 2002 and November 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lesions were situated at M1 trunk (n = 19), M1 origin (n = 12) and M1 bifurcation (n = 14), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The technical successful rate was 97.8% (44/45) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rate of complicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was 7.0% (3/43 patients) and the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 2.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During a follow-up of 7.0 months (median), there was no recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 41 available patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six-month angiographic follow-up was obtained in 6 patients (7 vessels), demonstrating good patency in 6 stenting vessels and restenosis in one vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Angioplasty associated with Biodiv Ysio stent appears to be a safe and feasible for the patients with symptomatic M1 stenosis of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, under strict control of periperformeral project </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further study is, however needed </plain></SENT>
