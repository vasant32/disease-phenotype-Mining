<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed in vitro experiments with a small volume chamber to determine the inhibitory effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> on <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>-, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi>-, and <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>-induced contractions of canine basilar and femoral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">Nifedipine</z:chebi>, an inhibitor of the influx of extracellular calcium into smooth muscle cells, was found to be a sensitive inhibitor of contractions of the basilar artery induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> did not significantly inhibit the <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi>-induced contractions of the femoral artery but did inhibit <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>-induced contractions of the femoral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Calcium-induced contractions of the basilar artery were also inhibited by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These experiments demonstrate a relatively selective effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> on the basilar artery, and a mechanism to explain this selective effect is postulated </plain></SENT>
