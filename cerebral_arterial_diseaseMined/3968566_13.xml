<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The perforating branches (PFB's) of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) were studied in 34 unfixed brain hemispheres which were injected with a polyester resin and dissected under the operating microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five hundred and eight vessels were identified and their site of origin, branching pattern, outer diameter (OD), and length recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four hundred and two PFB's (79%) originated from the main trunk of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> before its division; the remaining 106 vessels (21%) had their origin from branches of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> as follows: superior trunk, 43 vessels (8.5%); inferior trunk, 30 vessels (6%); middle trunk, four vessels (0.8%); early temporal branch, 27 vessels (5.3%); and early frontal branch, two vessels (0.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of PFB's in each hemisphere varied from five to 29 (mean 14.9 +/- 0.7 vessels) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The great majority of PFB's (96%) originated along the proximal 17 mm of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The PFB's arising in the first 10 mm had a mean OD of 0.35 +/- 0.01 mm and a mean length of 9.25 +/- 0.19 mm, and those arising from the second 10 mm had a mean OD of 0.47 +/- 0.02 mm and a mean length of 16.67 +/- 1.4 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A clear distinction between a medial and lateral group of PFB's was present in only 14 hemispheres (41%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In nine hemispheres (26%), perforating vessels from the anterior cerebral artery (A1 segment) and from the recurrent artery of Heubner replaced the medial group of PFB's of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In one case this group originated in an accessory <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In three hemispheres (9%) a small anastomosis (OD 0.2 mm) was seen between a PFB of the recurrent artery of Heubner and one of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>From a total of 508 PFB's, 255 vessels (50%) originated as single vessels, while 253 vessels (50%) originated as branches of common stems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The OD of the single vessels ranged from 0.1 mm to 1.1 mm (mean 0.39 +/- 0.02 mm), and the length from 3 to 20 mm (mean 10.8 +/- 0.2 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The common stems ranged in OD from 0.6 to 1.8 mm (mean 0.87 +/- 0.04 mm), and in length from 1 to 15 mm (mean 4.1 +/- 0.4 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The clinical application of these anatomical data to the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, and in the field of interventional neuroradiology is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The most frequent pathological entities involving the perforating vessels are also discussed </plain></SENT>
