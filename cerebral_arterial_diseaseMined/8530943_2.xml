<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A prospective pilot study was conducted to investigate the feasibility of CTA in the diagnosis of intracranial occlusive disease and its correlation with transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With transcranial Doppler, 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> or occlusion were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were seven middle cerebral artery stenoses and five middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CTA confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diagnoses by transcranial Doppler except in one patient with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in whom the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> had probably propagated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that CTA is feasible and potentially useful in the diagnosis of middle cerebral artery occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to assess its validity, sensitivity, and specificity in the diagnosis of middle cerebral artery occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
