<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A total of 1533 patients received primary aortic and/or mitral valve replacement, with or without tricuspid valve surgery or other associated cardiac procedures, from January 1, 1975, to July 1, 1979 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival at 5 years was 74% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hazard function (instantaneous risk) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was highest immediately after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the incremental risk factors for premature <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from any cause were preoperative NYHA class, any valve lesion other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo>, aortic cross-clamp time, and combined aortic and mitral valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten modes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were identified, each with its unique hazard function and risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The commonest mode was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>Sudden death</z:hpo> was the next commonest, and the early phase of its hazard function peaked about 3 weeks after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventy-five patients (6.7% of the 1533) had 103 valve reoperations in the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival after reoperation was less than that after the primary operation; whether the reoperation was the first, second, or third was a risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Actuarial freedom from prosthetic valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (PVE) was 97% at 1 year, and that of periprosthetic leakage without evident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was 98.8%; the hazard function for the event PVE had an early phase peaking at about 6 weeks and a constant low phase throughout, whereas that of periprosthetic leakage had a single early peaking phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After reoperations, the actuarial freedom from PVE and periprosthetic leakage was less than that after the original operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The risk factors for the development of periprosthetic leakage without evident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> were similar but not identical to those for PVE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among patients receiving a bioprosthesis, 91% were free of bioprosthetic degeneration 5 years after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The hazard function was single and continuously rising, and young age and female gender were risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Actuarial freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> prosthetic <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was 97.9% at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The single hazard function for this event peaked at 10 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was higher in female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The uses of this integrated study, and the inferences from it, are described </plain></SENT>
