<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of cerebral revascularization by a superficial temporal-middle cerebral artery anastomosis done 4 and 24 hours following combined occlusion of the middle cerebral and internal carotid arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>/ICA) was tested in 15 dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An untreated and a sham-operated group of 8 and 5 dogs, respectively, controlled possible intercurrent variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured by the hydrogen clearance method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Values of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and preocclusion blood flow under basal conditions and following inhalation of 5% <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> were similar to values reported by other researchers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Combined <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>/ICA occlusion produced a significant drop in rCBF in the ipsilateral hemisphere (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rCBF returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> following revascularization in 4 and 24 hours, and after the sham procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rCBF response to inhalation of 5% <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the revascularized group, but was reversed (p less than 0.01) in the sham group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reversal of flow in the sham group suggested that loss of cerebral autoregulation and steal of blood flow in the infarcted area occurred </plain></SENT>
