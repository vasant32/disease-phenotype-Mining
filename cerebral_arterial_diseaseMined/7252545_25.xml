<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationship of the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> protection to the presence or absence of recirculation was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">Barbiturate</z:chebi> therapy was begun 30 minutes after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The findings were as follows: 1) <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>, with its attendant monitoring, was safely tolerated by primates for 96 hours; 2) 6 hours of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion followed by recirculation resulted in a neurological deficit that was worse than the neurological deficit produced by permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion; 3) <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> for 96 hours, initiated 30 minutes after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, in the absence of reperfusion, was in fact detrimental; 4) <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> for 96 hours, initiated 30 minutes after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, with the establishment of reperfusion at 6 hours, provided nearly complete protection from ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
