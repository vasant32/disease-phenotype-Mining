<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the utility of constrat-enhanced transcranial color sonography (TCCS) in the diagnosis of cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> in cases of difficult acoustic window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2007 to July 2008, we prospectively studied 50 patients who fulfilled clinical criteria of brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, we performed TCCS aiming to insonate both middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and the basilar artery (BA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In those case in which insonation of any vessel was not possible, we repeated the exploration after injecting a 2.5-mL bolus of sulphurhexafluoridedispersion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Afterward, we compared the rate of insonation of the vessels and the number of conclusive studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean patient age was 53.2 +/- 15.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two were men (64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequent neurologic injury was hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and traumatic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Contrast-enhanced TCCS resulted in an increased rate of insonation in both <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and in BA, and in the number of conclusive studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Contrast-enhanced TCCS increased the number of conclusive studies with cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e>, which minimized the importance of a previous study in cases with a poor acoustic window </plain></SENT>
