<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although the natural history of extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> has been investigated systematically, limited data are available on the course of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors observed 102 consecutive patients (67 men, 35 women; mean age 61.9 years) with significant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis or occlusion as demonstrated by transcranial Doppler and transcranial color-coded duplex ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-six patients entered the study after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (n = 17) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n = 29); 56 patients were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurologic and ultrasound investigations were performed at regular intervals with a mean follow-up of 31 (range 6 to 117) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were continuously treated with either platelet inhibitors (n = 75) or anticoagulation (n = 27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen cerebral ischemic events (11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, 8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) occurred during follow-up, resulting in an overall annual rate of 7.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirteen events (8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) were attributable to the vascular territory ipsilateral to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with symptomatic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease at study entry had an overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk of 12.5% per year (ipsilateral: 9.1%), whereas the annual incidence in primarily asymptomatic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease was only 2.8% (ipsilateral: 1.4%; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease was an independent predictor for overall (hazard ratio [HR] 7.91, 95% CI 2.03 to 30.79; p &lt; 0.01) and ipsilateral (HR 9.66, 95% CI 1.5 to 62.25; p = 0.02) cerebrovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with asymptomatic middle <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral artery disease</z:e>, there was a high and continuous recurrence rate of ischemic events in symptomatic patients, which was even higher than in patients with symptomatic extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
