<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Several prospective trials have shown that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> can be prevented by performing an endarterectomy in patients with high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to ascertain the frequency of carotid artery tandem lesions and to determine whether their presence alters the surgeon's decision to perform an endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cerebral angiograms obtained between January 1994 and June 1996 in 853 patients with carotid occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studies were analyzed for the presence of internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis as well as for tandem lesions (defined as &gt; or = 50% diameter stenosis) within the common carotid artery, carotid siphon, or proximal intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of intracranial saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six hundred seventy-two of the 853 patients had a carotid bifurcation stenosis of 70% or greater or underwent an endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, a carotid siphon stenosis of 50% or greater was noted in 65 patients (9.7%) and was ipsilateral to an ICA stenosis in 37 patients (5.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A common <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> was present in 29 patients (4.3%), ipsilateral to an ICA stenosis in 14 patients (2.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A stenosis of 50% or greater within the proximal intracranial circulation was present in 28 patients (4.2%), ipsilateral to an ICA stenosis in 15 patients (2.2 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients had tandem stenoses at more than one site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Tandem stenoses in the siphon or intracranial segments were noted in 13.5% with a bifurcation stenosis and in 8.8% of those with no bifurcation stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Endarterectomy was performed in 48 of the 66 patients with tandem stenotic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of a tandem lesion infrequently alters the surgeon's decision to perform an endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the importance of detecting tandem stenoses cannot be underestimated, since they may have important implications for long-term medical management in symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
