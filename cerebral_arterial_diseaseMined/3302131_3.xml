<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was performed by immunohistochemical reaction testing for tubulin and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase BB-isoenzyme to visualize the neuronal structure and by immunohistochemical reaction testing for astroprotein (an astrocyte-specific protein) to visualize reactive astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The earliest ischemic lesion became visible in the frontoparietal cortex after 7 minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> as a laminar loss of the reaction for tubulin involving the neuropil, neuronal perikarya, and dendrites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The earliest lesion in the caudoputamen evolved after 30 minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After reestablishment of cerebral circulation, the immunohistochemical ischemic lesions in the neuronal structure disappeared if the ischemic period was 10 minutes or less and partially disappeared even after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> for 15 minutes in the cerebral cortex, while the postischemic lesion in the caudoputamen disappeared even after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> for 15 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reactive astrocytes were detected in the cerebral cortex and caudoputamen as early as 24 hours after reperfusion, both in the areas with and without the neuronal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No lesion was identified in the hippocampus or thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This experimental model is suitable for investigation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapidly progressive</z:hpo> regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the cerebral cortex and for comparison with other regional or global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the gerbil or other animal species </plain></SENT>
