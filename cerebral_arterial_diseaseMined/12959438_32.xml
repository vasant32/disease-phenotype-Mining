<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, the authors investigated whether monitoring of CBF with SPECT scanning after CEA can be used to identify patients at risk for hyperperfusion syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> were measured before CEA in 51 patients with ipsilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (&gt; or = 70% stenosis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was also measured immediately after CEA and on the 3rd postoperative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hyperperfusion (an increase in CBF of &gt; or = 100% compared with preoperative values) was observed immediately after CEA in eight of 12 patients with reduced preoperative CVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reduced preoperative CVR was the only significant independent predictor of post-CEA hyperperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-three patients in whom hyperperfusion was not detected immediately after CEA did not exhibit hyperperfusion on the 3rd postoperative day and did not experience hyperperfusion syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two of eight patients in whom hyperperfusion occurred immediately after CEA, CBF progressively increased and hyperperfusion syndrome developed, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> did not occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the remaining six of eight patients in whom hyperperfusion was detected immediately after CEA, the CBF progressively decreased and the hyperperfusion resolved by the 3rd postoperative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative measurement of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>-induced changes in CBF, which is performed using SPECT scanning, can be used to identify patients at risk for hyperperfusion after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, post-CEA monitoring of CBF performed using SPECT scanning results in the timely and reliable identification of patients at risk for hyperperfusion syndrome </plain></SENT>
