<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>For the purpose of investigating the protective action against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by a new <z:chebi fb="0" ids="14434,16069">imidazole</z:chebi> derivative (Y-9179) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi>, regional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was produced in 53 cats by permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) via the transorbital approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 20 cats, the clips were applied at the origin of the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> whereas in the remaining 33 they were applied laterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The administration of Y-9179 (6.25 and 12.5 mg/kg/day), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> (25 mg/kg/day) and saline was started 30 min after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and continued for 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cats were observed for 7 days and then sacrificed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since there was a remarkable difference in mortality between the medial (65%) and the lateral occlusion groups (15%), the evaluation of drug effects was based only on the results obtained with the lateral occlusion group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The brains were sliced at 4 fixed coronal planes, in which the ratios of the infarcted area in the 2 hemispheres were obtained by planimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant decrease in the infarction rate was found both in Y-9179 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi>-treated groups compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> depressant action of Y-9179 is far less potent than that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi>, the present results indicate the potential usefulness of Y-9179 in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
