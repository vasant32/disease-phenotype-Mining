<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the availability of superficial temporal artery (STA) duplex ultrasonography (STDU) for evaluating the improvement of cerebral hemodynamics after extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study included 56 consecutive patients who underwent EC-IC bypass for occlusive disease of their cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STA duplex ultrasonography (STDU) was performed to measure the flow velocity, pulsatility index, and diameter of ipsilateral STA before and 14 days after EC-IC bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> (ACZ) reactivity of ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory were evaluated by quantitative single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean flow velocities of ipsilateral STA were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.0001) and PI value was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.0001) 14 days after EC-IC bypass than before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diameter of ipsilateral STA was also larger 14 days after EC-IC bypass than before (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>STA mean flow velocity was significantly correlated with the rCBF 14 days after EC-IC bypass (R = 0.55, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The post-surgical STA mean flow velocity cut-off value over 58.2 cm/sec yielded the highest diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, 75%; specificity, 74%) for excellent rCBF value (&gt; or =40 ml/100 g/min) after EC-IC bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ipsilateral STA mean blood flow velocity is a highly sensitive parameter for predicting rCBF in the ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory after EC-IC bypass </plain></SENT>
