<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>3 males and 7 females aged 6 to 60 years (mean age 30 years) were investigated in the Department of Neuroradiology of Toulouse between 1989 and 1994 with CT, angiography and MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 5 cases the dissection involved the carotid artery, in 5 cases the vertebro-basilar system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentation was of two types: ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (7 cases) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (3 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their evolution is never lethal, contrary to the classical descriptions of the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases an initial angiography then follow up has been performed showing an irregular located <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of intracranial dissection is sometimes made in front of a dissequant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In case of doubt, magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging is helpful showing a linear hypersignal parallel to an arterial segmental stenosis, and angiography <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> an irregular aspect and stenosis of the endoluminal artery </plain></SENT>
