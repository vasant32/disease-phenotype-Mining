<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To investigate the optimal values of flow velocity on transcranial Doppler (TCD) in grading the severity of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) stenosis in comparison with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Both TCD and MRA examinations were performed on 148 asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The peak flow velocities of each <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Severity of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis on MRA was classified as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-mild (&lt; 50% lumen diameter reduction), moderate (50%-75%), and severe-void (&gt; 75% and void of flow signal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 296 MCAs evaluated, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-mild stenosis was found in 75 (25%), moderate stenosis in 112 (38%), and severe stenosis in 109 (37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean of systolic velocity (Vs) of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> differed significantly among these three groups: mean Vs = 121.83 +/- 22.52 cm/s in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-mild group; 155.96 +/- 21.62 cm/s for the moderate group; and 199.39 +/- 43.86 cm/s for the severe group (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The optimal cutoff velocity for detection of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (&gt; 50%) stenosis was found at Vs &gt; 140 cm/s on TCD (area under the ROC curve is 0.87, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The best cutoff points for grading severity of on TCD were 140 cm/s and 180 cm/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TCD enables grading of the severity of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis according to the flow velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This method provides a noninvasive and reliable method for grading <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis and allows longitudinal monitoring of the relationship between clinical outcome and hemodynamic change </plain></SENT>
