<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hemodynamic compromise in symptomatic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005296'>occlusive vascular disease</z:hpo> (OVD) identified by cerebrovascular reserve (CVR) and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) is an independent predictor of high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, up to 60% of patients compromised by CVR have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> OEF indicating a high rate of discordance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CVR is measured with an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge, and OEF reactivity (OEFR) to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>, ie, a hemodynamic challenge, may reveal hemodynamic compromise and less discordance with measurements of CVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine symptomatic patients with OVD were studied by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography before and 15 minutes after 15 mg/kg intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> in the middle cerebral artery territories of each hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A close correlation between hemispheric CVR and OEFR was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two hemispheres from two different patients showed an increase in OEF to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge despite a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> baseline OEF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The two hemispheres showing an increase in OEF in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> were also associated with the lowest CVR and severest white matter hyperintensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that positive OEFR may distinguish hemispheres in hemodynamic compromise despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> OEF and show less discordance with CVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, these preliminary observations require confirmation in a larger study </plain></SENT>
