<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>2 These arteries relaxed to prostacyclin but contracted to <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> endoperoxide (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15554">PGH2</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>3 Human and baboon isolated arteries also generated prostacyclin from exogenous endoperoxide (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15554">PGH2</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>4 Human arteries generated prostacyclin 36 h post-mortem but not 40 h post-mortem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The biologically generated prostacyclin relaxed the basilar artery and overcame the contractile effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15554">PGH2</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>5 Thromboxane A2-like activity generated during human platelet aggregation by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> caused contractions of the human basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>6 Prostacyclin reversed contractions of human basilar arteries caused by an unidentified vasoconstrictor factor in cerebrospinal fluid obtained from patients with cerebral arterial vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> following rupture of cerebral arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The above vasospasm may be due at least in part to disordered physiological control of the calibre of cerebral arteries caused by diminished synthesis of prostacyclin </plain></SENT>
