<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CTA provides high-resolution imaging of the head and neck vasculature but also of the soft tissues and bones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This results in a large volume of information to be interpreted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examines interpretation errors with head and neck CTAs and assesses whether double reading reduces miss rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive CTAs of the neck and intracranial circulation were retrospectively identified and reviewed for vascular and nonvascular findings by a consensus of 2 neuroradiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with the official report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant discrepancies were considered those that would have influenced follow-up or management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We reviewed 503 studies; 144 were originally reported by a staff neuroradiologist alone, 209 by staff and diagnostic radiology resident, and 150 by staff and neuroradiology fellow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six significant discrepancies were discovered in 20 studies, corresponding to 4.0% of studies with at least 1 miss, and an overall miss rate per study of 5.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was at least 1 miss in 6.3% of studies interpreted by a staff neuroradiologist alone, 3.3% by staff and resident, and 2.7% by staff and fellow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The miss rate differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common misses were small <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (50% of misses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CTA neck and head datasets are now large, and there is a potential for missed findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Significant discrepancies can occur with a low but not insignificant rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Arterial pathology accounted for most discrepancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This study emphasizes the need for careful systematic scrutiny for both vascular and nonvascular pathology regardless of indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Double reading reduces error rates </plain></SENT>
