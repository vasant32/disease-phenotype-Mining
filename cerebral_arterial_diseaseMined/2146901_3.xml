<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most infarctions occur in the presence of intracranial stenotic lesions of the large vessels of the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler (TCD), by measuring flow velocity in these arterial segments, can detect focal stenosis on the basis of elevated flow velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report the preliminary results of a prospective study to develop criteria for detection of stenotic lesions based on TCD and identification of patients with Hb SS at risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparing the TCD findings from six patients with lesions demonstrated by angiography to those from 115 Hb SS children without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we conclude: (a) middle cerebral (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), anterior cerebral (ACA), or internal carotid (ICA) artery mean velocities greater than 190 cm/s strongly suggest focal stenosis; (b) <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> or ACA mean velocities of 150 to 190 cm/s suggest abnormality but at present cannot be considered diagnostic of stenosis; (c) mean velocities up to 150 cm/s are possibly due to the effects of low hematocrit and/or young age, and cannot as yet be distinguished from velocity elevations due to vessel stenosis </plain></SENT>
