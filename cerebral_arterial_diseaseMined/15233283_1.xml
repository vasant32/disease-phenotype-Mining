<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To quantitate CBF by means of SPECT with <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>, an autoradiographic (ARG) method has been developed and is widely used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the ARG method, CBF is calculated from the brain counts of the SPECT scan with an assumed distribution volume value of <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> (Vd) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, differences between true Vd and assumed Vd results in errors in calculated CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, errors in the CBF response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> stress as calculated by the ARG method were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SPECT studies were performed on 12 patients with steno-occlusive lesions of the major cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two studies were performed on separate days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The first study was performed at rest (baseline), and the second during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SPECT scans were performed at 40 min (early scan) and 180 min (delayed scan) after intravenous injection of <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although a simulation study showed that errors in calculated changes in CBF in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> stress, which result from differences between the true Vd and the assumed Vd, were larger when the baseline CBF and change in CBF were larger, values calculated by the ARG method with an assumed Vd were in good agreement with those calculated with true Vd obtained from early and delayed scan data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data indicate that errors in the calculated CBF response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> stress as calculated by the ARG method are negligible even at high CBF responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The ARG method is therefore reliable for measurement of CBF response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> stress </plain></SENT>
