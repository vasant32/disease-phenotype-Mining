<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the indications, safety and effectiveness of intracranial deployment of stents in treatment of systematic intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Stent-assisted angioplasty was performed upon 7 consecutive patients with symptoms of intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> unresponsive to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy and antiplatelet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lesions involved the middle cerebral artery in 3 cases, distal end of internal carotid artery in one case, basilar artery in one case, and intracranial section of vertebral artery in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Short-term clinical and angiographic data were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Symptoms of procedure-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> and intracranial haematoma developed later were found in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Emergency craniotomy was performed 5 hours after the stenosis-assisted angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients experienced alleviation of symptoms without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">apoplexy</z:e> during the short-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Angiography showed that the stenosis degree reduced from 83% to 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>0 - 3 months of follow-up by transcranial Doppler showed good patency of stented lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Stent-assisted angioplasty effectively treats atherosclerotic intracranial stenosis lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up and further clinical/technical research are still needed </plain></SENT>
