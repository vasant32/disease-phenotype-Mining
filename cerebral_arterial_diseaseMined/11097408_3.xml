<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighty-eight subjects without carotid obstruction were measured for mean velocity, vessel area, and volume flow rates of both <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> with phase-contrast <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A high-resolution sequence with a matrix of 300 x 512 and a double oblique localizing strategy was used for measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A mean velocity of 33 +/- 6.8 cm/s, a mean vessel area of 6.2 +/- 1.2 mm2 and a mean flow rate of 121 +/- 28 ml/min were measured in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lower volume flow rates were seen in subjects aged over 50 years (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When comparing women with men, a lower vessel area (p &lt; 0.05) of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was counterbalanced by a higher velocity, resulting in no significant difference of the volume flow rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No difference occurred between the right and the left side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Flow reduction occurs in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A lower vessel area of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in women is compensated by a higher velocity </plain></SENT>
