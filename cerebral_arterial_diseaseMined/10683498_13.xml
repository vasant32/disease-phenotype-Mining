<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three groups of rats, treated with 90-min, 120-min, or sham occlusion were used in functional studies for 22 weeks following surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The following tests were used: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6809">methamphetamine</z:chebi>-induced rotation, the staircase test, acquisition of operant responding, running-wheel behavior, and performance of operant differential reinforcement of a low-rate responding (DRL) schedule of reinforcement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histology performed at 23 weeks following <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> showed on average modest damage of a 19% reduction in hemispheric volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the behavioral tests conducted, rotation, the staircase test, and the operant DRL were sensitive to ischemic damage, and were under some circumstances related to lesion size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data show that long-term functional deficits following MCAO are demonstrable, and hence, assessment of long-term neuroprotection is feasible </plain></SENT>
