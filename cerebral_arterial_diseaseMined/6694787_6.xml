<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report five patients who presented with sudden severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and who developed progressive neurological deficits, two becoming <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None had a history of trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was suspected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> proved to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematomas</z:hpo> caused by "spontaneous" rupture of a cortical artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nineteen similar cases have been reported in the English literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The source of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was identified as a cortical artery located near the sylvian region in four of our five patients and in most of the reported cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There are several possible anatomical situations that may predispose a cortical artery to "spontaneous" rupture: (a) spontaneous rupture of a cortical artery at the point of origin of a fragile arterial twig, especially a right-angled branch, a point of potential <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>; (b) rupture of a small artery traversing the subdural space and connecting a cortical artery to the dura mater (a "bridging" artery); (c) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e> between a cortical artery and arachnoid or dura mater; (d) a knuckle of cortical artery protruding through the arachnoid and adherent to the dura mater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In each situation, the artery is probably torn by a sudden movement of the brain during a vigorous head movement, not severe enough to be considered trauma </plain></SENT>
