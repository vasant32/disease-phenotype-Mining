<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>With the use of a new ultrasonic volume flow meter (VFM), over 8000 measurements of common carotid blood flow were made in 120 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects and 550 patients with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of the flow meter in measuring blood flow on an experimental model ranged from 93 to 97% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, common carotid blood flow varies with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It increased from newborn to age 20 and gradually decreased thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy subjects, the flow varies within +/- 6.7% (2SD) at one sitting (intrasession) and +/- 21.2% (2SD) from week to week (intersession study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carotid blood flow varies linearly with PaCO2 and increased markedly in response to endotracheal intubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In healthy adults, the flow ratio between the two common carotid arteries is 1.07 +/- 0.052 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This ratio increases in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> to 1.28 +/- 0.23 (p less than 0.05) and in patients with intracranial space occupying lesions to 1.46 +/- 0.39, (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 26 consecutive cases of carotid endarterectomies, the preoperative common carotid blood volume flow was 5.1 +/- 1.0 cc/sec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases preoperatively had at least 30% stenosis and ranged from 30 to 100% stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The carotid blood volume was significantly increased post-operatively (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall accuracy in detecting carotid and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial disease</z:e> is 89% with sensitivity of 96% and the specificity of 71% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our clinical experience indicates that this device is not only a valuable noninvasive diagnostic tool for evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> but also appears to be useful in assessing cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
