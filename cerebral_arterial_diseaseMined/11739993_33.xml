<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis have a high rate of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a prospective study to determine which factors are associated with the progression of symptomatic middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) stenosis and to evaluate the relationship between progression and clinical recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 1996 and February 2000, of a total of 2564 consecutive first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients admitted to our cerebrovascular unit, 145 showed an <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis signal on transcranial Doppler (TCD) on admission, and 40 fulfilled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> criteria to enter this study, including angiographic confirmation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were prescribed antiplatelet or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> agents following the criteria of the neurologist in charge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TCD recordings and clinical interviews were performed regularly during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Progression of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis was defined as an increase &gt;30 cm/s in TCD-recorded maximum mean flow velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analyses were used to identify predictors of progression and clinical recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 26.55 months, 13 (32.5%) <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenoses progressed, 3 (7.5%) regressed, and 24 (60%) remained stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Absence of significant extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis (P=0.049) and the use of oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (P=0.045) were significantly associated with a lower progression rate in univariate analysis, and anticoagulation remained an independent predictor when a logistic regression model was applied (OR 7.25, CI 1.1 to 48.1, P=0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A new ischemic event during follow-up in the territory supplied by the stenosed <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occurred in 8 cases (20%), and 13 patients had a major vascular event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Progression of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis detected by TCD was independently associated with a new ipsilateral ischemic event (OR 2.89, CI 1.09 to 7.71, P=0.031) and with the occurrence of any major vascular event (OR 7.03, CI 1.6 to 30.9, P=0.0071) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Progression of symptomatic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis detected by means of TCD predicts clinical recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation is independently associated with a lower progression rate of symptomatic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
