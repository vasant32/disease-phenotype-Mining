<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initially the patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a community hospital showed abnormalities in the pons, and vertebrobasilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient was transferred to the university hospital because of neurological deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Just before thrombolysis, his physical examination revealed a downward <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112602" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ocular deviation</z:e>, stretching of the arms, and spontaneous movements of the legs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI showed recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> in the pons and caudal part of the mesencephalon, and magnetic resonance angiography showed occlusion of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intra-arterial thrombolysis with urokinase (total dose 36 000U/kg) was performed 60 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After thrombolysis he was treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> for 10 days, followed by aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient recovered well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 1 year he had only minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> and performed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> activities at school </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Local <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> due to an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with Borrelia burgdorferi was thought to be the cause of the local <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A review of the literature revealed 11 other case reports of successful local intra-arterial thrombolysis in children and adolescents with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This suggests that intra-arterial thrombolysis is feasible and safe in selected paediatric patients with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
