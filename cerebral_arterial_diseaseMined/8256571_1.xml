<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats had 6-h <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and treated animals received either 3 or 10 mg/kg AT-877 s.c. just after the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Control animals received an equal volume of the vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prior to sacrifice, significant changes in the decrease of blood pressure and the increase of plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were observed in the treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size tended to decrease, this decrease was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only when the blood pressure- or plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-matched subgroups were compared, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume decreased significantly in the drug-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, AT-877 failed to reduce ischemic brain damage unless the blood pressure or plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were controlled </plain></SENT>
