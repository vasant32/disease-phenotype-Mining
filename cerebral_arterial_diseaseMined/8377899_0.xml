<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He had been suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> (left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>) since 8 days prior to admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> episodes had increased from 2 times to 5 or 6 times a day and the episodes lasted from approximately 10 minutes to over 20 minutes on the day before admission, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> was considered to be of the crescendo type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On admission, neurological examination and CT scans showed no abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An angiography revealed a severe stenosis of the horizontal portion (M1) of the right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An endarterectomy was performed using a pterional approach on the day of admission because of the crescendo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> was not used during the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient showed left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> after the endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed immediately after the surgery, and severe stenosis caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333205,C1260883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mural thrombus</z:e> was found at the operative site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An emergency STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis was carried out to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> did not <z:chebi fb="72" ids="38954">abate</z:chebi>, and a CT scan taken a few days after the surgery revealed a low density area which included the right, basal ganglia and internal capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two weeks after the surgery, angiography was again performed to determine the patency of the anastomosis, which showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> configuration of the M1, indicating that the stenosis had disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It was considered that if <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> had been used during the endarterectomy, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333205,C1260883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mural thrombus</z:e> formation at the M1 would have been prevented, and neurological deficit would not have appeared </plain></SENT>
