<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis of intracranial large-artery disease has always been conventional angiography, magnetic resonance angiography changes, confirmed with intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography in 2 of these patients, were quite sufficient to define the occlusive disease in each of the cases </plain></SENT>
