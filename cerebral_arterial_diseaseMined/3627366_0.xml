<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They were followed up about 3 years long on the average postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Postoperative angiography revealed patent bypass in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No remarkable changes at the site of stenosis were observed in the group A (6 in 13 cases), who had angiographically sufficient inherent collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By contrast, group B (7 in 13 cases), who had insufficient inherent collateral circulation, showed remarkable progress in the degree of stenosis and significant changes of flow patterns were observed after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, these postoperative changes did not bring any clinical deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During follow-up period (31.2 months on the average) after operation, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> were encountered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases and clinically improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass rendered more beneficial effect to the patient with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis when compared with natural histories reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
