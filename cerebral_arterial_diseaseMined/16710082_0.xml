<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We report the results of an open, randomized, multicenter trial that compared the efficacy of aspirin to oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>) for the prevention of vascular events in patients with symptomatic stenosis of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive 300 mg/day of aspirin or a dose of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> (target INR 2-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis was demonstrated by conventional angiography or by at least two noninvasive examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients had either <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (CI) attributable to the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis within 90 days before inclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was: nonfatal CI, nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were followed-up for a minimum of 1 year and a maximum of 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study included 28 patients (14 in each treatment group); the average age was 67 +/- 9.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Men constituted 68% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of 23.1 +/- 10.9 months, there were no recurrences of CI in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No endpoint was reported in the aspirin group, but 2 patients in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> group (14.3%) exhibited vascular events: 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that aspirin is the treatment of choice for the prevention of vascular events in patients with symptomatic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
