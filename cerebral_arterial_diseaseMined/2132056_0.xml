<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the selection of the patients cases were ruled out with coexistent intracranial haematomas, and the patients treated surgically were ruled out in whom the course of the operation suggested a possible influence of additional factors which might have changed the condition of the patient independently of the main disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Depending on the results of angiography three groups of patients were isolated with different likelihood of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> development: patients without vasospasm or with segmental vasospasm-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> developed in 15%-9% of cases; patients with unilateral or bilateral diffuse vasospasm of low or medium intensity-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 34%; patients with high-grade diffuse intensity-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 73% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in these groups is analysed in relation to the condition of the patient at the time of angiographic examination </plain></SENT>
