<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify determinants associated with increasing severity of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) stenosis in asymptomatic Chinese type 2 diabetic patients with and without <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis determined using transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conventional risk factors contribute to the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, and differences in the pattern of these may explain the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of disease presentation in different populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Chinese patients, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis is the most commonly identified intracranial vascular lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Anthropometric and fasting biochemical parameters were compared between type 2 diabetic patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis in one (n = 185) or both (n = 200) vessels and 1,492 type 2 diabetic patients without evidence of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increasing <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenotic vascular involvement was associated with significantly increasing age, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, systolic blood pressure, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, but with lower <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was also an increased prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, and use of blood pressure-and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering agents in the patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concomitant significant increases in the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> were also observed in the patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transcranial Doppler examination identified stenosis in one or both <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> in over one-fifth of the Chinese type 2 diabetic subjects without symptoms of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A number of conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> were closely associated with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This technique may allow the identification of a particularly high-risk group, and further studies are required to determine whether asymptomatic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis is predictive of primary cerebrovascular events and whether intensive treatment of risk factors would reduce the risk </plain></SENT>
