<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Doppler sonography alone is a reliable method for determining patency and relative function of the anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dynamic CT permits qualitative evaluation of cerebral perfusion and, by comparison of pre- and postoperative scans, assessment of the contribution of the extra-/intracranial bypass to the circulation of the affected hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Combined use of Doppler sonography and dynamic CT provides sufficient information about the postoperative status of cerebral perfusion to obviate the use of conventional angiography in routine cases </plain></SENT>
