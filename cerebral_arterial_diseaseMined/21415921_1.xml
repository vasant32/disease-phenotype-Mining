<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients aged ≤ 30 years with arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in 1988-1997 and 2006-2010 admitted to Haukeland University Hospital in Bergen, Norway, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Risk factors and etiology were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 1988 and 1997, 16 females and 7 males had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, whereas 0 females and 13 males had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in 2006-2010 (P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in females was significantly lower between 2006 and 2010 than between 1988 and 1997 (P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> among young females has dropped significantly during recent years </plain></SENT>
