<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Despite research in the anatomical sciences for the last 200 years, some structures of the human body remain controversial or incompletely described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of these structures is the A1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze the A1 segment of the ACA using novel stereoscopic methods because the 3-dimensional morphometry of the ACA is important to neurosurgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A digital-image computer-based system was used to analyze the A1 segment of 230 ACAs derived from computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data analysis included the inner diameter, length, and volume and calculation of A1 symmetry, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath>, and deviation, and tortuosity indexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>Hypoplasia</z:mpath> of the A1 segment was found in 0.87% and only on the right sides, whereas asymmetry was found in 42.6% and was more common in female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Right A1 segments tended to be longer in male patients, and this reached significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also of significance was the correlation of an <z:mp ids='MP_0001257'>increased length</z:mp> with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Right A1 segments tended to have greater volumes, and this was significant in a comparison of male and female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Tortuosity indexes tended to be greater for left sides, but deviation indexes tended to be greater on the right sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Morphometric data of the A1 segment of the ACA as analyzed in the present study may be of utility to the neurosurgeon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Right A1 segments tend to be more tortuous, more deviated, longer, and narrower than left A1 segments </plain></SENT>
