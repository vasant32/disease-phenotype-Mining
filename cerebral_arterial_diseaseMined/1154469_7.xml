<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cerbral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> regularly involved the basal ganglia, internal capsule, and cortical regions, and were larger and less variable than those produced by <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion through and open optic foramen or craniectomy with cranial decompression by drainage of CSF </plain></SENT>
