<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence, clinical presentation, imaging findings, and prognosis of cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathies</z:e> in childhood NF1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients followed at the NF1 clinic at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, between 1990 and 2007 were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with confirmed NF1 diagnosis and neuroimaging results were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> neuroimaging studies were reviewed for the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> by 2 study pediatric neuroradiologists blinded to clinical information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical records of children with cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 419 children with confirmed NF1, 266 (63%) received neuroimaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among children with neuroimaging results, 17 had cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> (minimum prevalence rate of 6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the 35 patients who received magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> was more common in patients with NF1 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009734'>optic gliomas</z:hpo> (11 of 21) compared with those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0009734'>optic glioma</z:hpo> (4 of 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven percent of children developed focal deficits months to years after the diagnosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follow-up at a mean of 7 years after diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> showed that 35% (6 of 17) had progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> requiring revascularization surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seven patients received aspirin for primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On retrospective review of imaging studies, a mean delay of 51 months to clinical radiographic reporting of these findings was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> in children with NF1 in this study was at least 6% and was associated with young age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009734'>optic glioma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Arteriopathy</z:e> causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with resultant neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Medical and/or surgical interventions may prevent these complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the addition of vascular imaging (MRA/conventional angiography) to brain imaging studies for early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> should be considered for children with NF1, particularly young patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009734'>optic glioma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
