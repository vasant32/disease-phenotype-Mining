<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Lateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic infarction</z:e> (LTI) is usually caused by small vessel disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>), i.e., occlusion of the deep perforator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, focal atherosclerotic posterior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral artery disease</z:e> (PCAD) may produce LTI via thrombotic occlusion of the perforator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the prevalence of PCAD in LTI and differences in clinical and imaging findings between LTIs associated with PCAD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 58 consecutive patients with isolated LTI who underwent diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography (MRA) within 7 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups: those with PCAD and those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical syndromes were divided into pure sensory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="53277">PSS</z:chebi>) and sensory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> plus (SS-plus), i.e., the concomitant presence of motor dysfunction or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical and imaging findings were compared between these two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 58 patients, 13 (22.4%) had PCAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="53277">PSS</z:chebi> was more frequently associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> than with PCAD (57.8% vs. 23.1%, P=0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Initial DWI lesion volume (cm³) was significantly larger in PCAD than in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> (0.38±0.13 vs. 0.33±0.22, P=0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the 23 patients (39.7%) who underwent follow-up DWI, patients with PCAD showed a significantly greater increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> lesion volume than those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> (P=0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale scores did not differ at admission (P=0.185), they were significantly higher at discharge in PCAD than in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> (P=0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that PCAD is an important cause of LTI, being related to SS-plus, larger lesion volume, and worse clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
