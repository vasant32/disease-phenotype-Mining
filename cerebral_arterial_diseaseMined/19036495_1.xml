<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No study has explored poststroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (PSD) in different etiological types of SSIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with SSIs resulting from LAD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Poststroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was evaluated with the 15-item version of the geriatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scale (GDS) 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 127 patients with SSIs, 44 had LAD and 83 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The LAD group had a significantly higher mean GDS score and higher frequency of PSD (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The etiological type LAD was a significant independent risk factor for PSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PSD is more common in patients with SSIs resulting from LAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that cerebral blood perfusion may play an important role in the development of PSD </plain></SENT>
