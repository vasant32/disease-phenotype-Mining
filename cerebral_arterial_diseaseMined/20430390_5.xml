<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although stiffness of central arteries is more preferentially associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) than that of peripheral arteries, less is known for cerebrovascular disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) and peripheral artery disease (PAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured pulse wave velocity (PWV) in four arterial segments, and examined the relative changes in the four regional PWVs in patients with CAD, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> or PAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The 2798 subjects were selected from 3300 consecutive participants of our non-invasive vascular lab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>342 subjects had one or more pre-existing atherosclerotic diseases including 128 CAD (N=128), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> (N=195) and PAD (N=83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PWVs were simultaneously measured using an automated pulse wave analyzer (model BP-203RPE, Colin) in the heart-femoral (hf, aorta), heart-carotid (hc), heart-brachial (hb), and femoral-ankle (fa) segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As compared to the subjects without atheroscletoric disease, those with CAD, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, or PAD showed higher levels of PWV in the four arterial segments, particularly in hfPWV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relative increase in hfPWV remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, pulse rate, smoking, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> mellistus, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the preferential increase in central arterial stiffness is found not only in CAD but <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and PAD as well </plain></SENT>
