<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The goal of the study was to compare performances of transcranial color-coded duplex sonography (TCCS) and transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) in the diagnosis of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) narrowing in the same population of patients using statistical and nonstatistical intelligent models for data analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively collected data from 179 consecutive routine digital subtraction angiography (DSA) procedures performed in 111 patients (mean age 54.17+/-14.4 years; 59 women, 52 men) who underwent TCD and TCCS examinations simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each patient was examined independently using both ultrasound techniques, 267 M1 segments of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> were assessed and narrowings were classified as &lt; or =50% and &gt;50% lumen reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic performance was estimated by two statistical and two artificial neural networks (ANN) classification methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Separate models were constructed for the TCD and TCCS sonographic data, as well as for detection of "any narrowing" and "severe narrowing" of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Input for each classifier consisted of the peak-systolic, mean and end-diastolic velocities measured with each sonographic method; the output was <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> narrowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Arterial narrowings less or equal 50% of lumen reduction were found in 55 and &gt;50% narrowings in 26 out of 267 arteries, as indicated by DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the category of "any narrowing" the rate of correct assignment by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> models was 82% to 83% for TCCS and 79% to 81% for TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the diagnosis of &gt;50% narrowing the overall classification accuracy remained in the range of 89% to 90% for TCCS data and 90% to 91% for TCD data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For the diagnosis of any narrowing, the sensitivity of the TCCS was significantly higher than that of the TCD, while for diagnosis of &gt;50% <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> narrowing, sensitivity of the TCCS was similar to sensitivity of the TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study showed that TCCS outperforms conventional TCD in detection of &lt; or =50% <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> narrowing, whereas no significant difference in accuracy between both methods was found in the diagnosis of &gt;50% <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> narrowing </plain></SENT>
