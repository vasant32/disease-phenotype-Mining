<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and arterial-to-capillary blood volume (V(0)) induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> (ACZ) are expected to be parallel each other in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> circulation; however, it has not been proven that the same changes in those parameters are observed in patients with cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the relationship between changes in CBF, vasodilatory capacity, and other hemodynamic parameters, the ACZ test was performed after an (15)O-gas PET study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two patients with unilateral major cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003838" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial occlusive disease</z:e> underwent PET scans using the H(2)(15)O bolus method with the ACZ test after the (15)O-gas steady-state method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CBF and V(0) for each subject were calculated using the 3-weighted integral method as well as the nonlinear least-squares fitting method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After evaluation of accuracy in V(0) values, a new parameter, the CBF/V(0) ratio, which is expected to disclose arterial perfusion pressure, was also compared between the conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The regional CBF (rCBF) and V(0) increased significantly after ACZ administration in the hemisphere contralateral to the ischemic side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in a subgroup of patients who showed a significant reduction in the rCBF increase in the ipsilateral hemisphere (group A), the ACZ injection caused no change or a slight decrease in rCBF even though the V(0) showed a significant increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the increases in rCBF and V(0) did not necessarily parallel each other in the ipsilateral hemispheres of patients who have impaired cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A parameter defined by the rCBF/V(0) ratio decreased significantly in the ipsilateral hemisphere of group A after ACZ administration, although the ratio showed no change in the contralateral hemisphere or in the other subgroup (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The change in the rCBF/V(0) ratio after ACZ challenge may represent an alteration in arterial perfusion pressure that is expected to indicate a critical hemodynamic status in patients with cerebrovascular disease, especially in patients who have a reduced rCBF response </plain></SENT>
