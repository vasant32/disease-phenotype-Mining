<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 84 patients, OEF, CBF, CVR to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>, and BRBP were assessed using ¹⁵O-PET and N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-p-[¹²³I]-iodoamphetamine and [¹²³I]-iomazenil SPECT, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A region of interest was automatically placed in the middle cerebral artery territory using a 3-dimensional stereotactic region of interest template </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for the affected side-to-contralateral side asymmetry on SPECT-BRBP/CBF to detect the abnormally elevated PET-OEF in the affected hemisphere were 100%, 86.4%, 66.7%, and 100%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in detecting the abnormally elevated PET-OEF in the affected hemisphere did not differ between analysis of the combination of SPECT-CBF and SPECT-CVR in the affected hemisphere (0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-0.94) and that of the affected side-to-contralateral side asymmetry on SPECT-BRBP/CBF (0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.86-0.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The combination of the 3 detected abnormally elevated PET-OEF with 97.0% specificity and 90.0% positive predictive value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of central BRBP/CBF asymmetry on SPECT is equivalent to that of the combination of CBF and CVR to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> on SPECT for detecting misery perfusion in patients with unilateral major cerebral artery occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
