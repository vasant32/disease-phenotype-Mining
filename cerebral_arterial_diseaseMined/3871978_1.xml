<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After a single scan, multiple transverse, coronal and sagittal section images were reconstructed with a minicomputer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In eighteen patients, we determined the values of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the region of interest using an image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transmission computed tomography (CT) studies were also performed on the same day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ECT showed cerebral perfusion abnormalities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, while CT showed abnormalities in only 10 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This technique seems to be useful for evaluating the rCBF in the deep brain </plain></SENT>
