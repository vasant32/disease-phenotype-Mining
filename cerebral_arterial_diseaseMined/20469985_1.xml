<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The purpose of this paper was to present the safety, efficacy, and clinical/angiographic follow-up results of HyperForm balloon-assisted endosaccular coil occlusion of distal anterior circulation bifurcation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Over a 7-year period, the authors treated 864 middle cerebral artery, distal anterior cerebral artery bifurcation, and anterior communicating artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> by means of coil embolization with HyperForm balloon assistance in 800 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 37 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, 2 HyperForm balloons were used simultaneously for remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall mortality rate was 7.1%, including 1.4% procedural mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Various neurological deficits were present at discharge in 8.9% of the patients, and 4.4% had permanent disabling morbidity 6 months posttreatment (modified Rankin Scale score â‰¥ 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thromboembolic complications developed during the treatment of 15 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (1.7%) causing morbidity or mortality in 10 cases (1.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 14 intraoperative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> (1.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 14 cases, the HyperForm balloon saved patients from severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> led to morbidity or mortality in 3 cases (0.4%); there were no negative consequences in 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 726 patients with 757 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (87.6%) available for follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Control angiograms were obtained at 6 months in 386 patients, at 1 year in 267, and at 2 years in 104, revealing an 82% complete obliteration rate according to the most recent follow-up angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The satisfactory results obtained in this experience demonstrate that HyperForm balloon remodeling provides strong benefits for the endovascular management of middle cerebral, anterior cerebral, and anterior communicating artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> without increasing the risk of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Not only does this technique allow for the safe treatment of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, but it also expands the indications of endovascular treatment to include <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> that otherwise cannot be treated with simple coil embolization </plain></SENT>
