<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family transduce their signal through ligand-induced heteromeric complexes that consist of type I and type II serine/threonine kinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both TGF-beta receptors are abundant in many peripheral tissues, but clear evidence of their expression in cortical astrocytes and neurons has not been published so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the expression of type I and type II TGF-beta receptors and their potential ligands (TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, and TGF-beta3) in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> by using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, to further the study of those cell types that exhibit TGF-beta isoforms and related receptors, we examined through the use of RT-PCR whether cortical neurons and astrocytes in culture express the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> for TGF-betas and their receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that the three TGF-beta isoform <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> are present in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, although astrocytes in culture display <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three isoforms, neurons in culture express only TGF-beta2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that both type I and type II TGF-beta receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> and proteins are present in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> and in cultures of cortical neurons and astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, TGF-betas may act as autocrine and paracrine signals in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> between both neurons and astrocytes via the same receptor systems as those found in peripheral tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TGF-beta1 has been shown to be induced following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752304" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoxic-ischemic brain injury</z:e> and may play a critical role in the pathophysiology of degenerative processes in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the present investigation, we confirmed that the expression of TGF-beta1 was increased markedly up until 24 h and thereafter was stable over the first 3 days following permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, whereas the expression of the type I TGF-beta receptor was not altered by the ischemic insult, the pattern of the type II TGF-beta receptors was modified dramatically in the ischemic area 3 days after the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data show that, even if ligands are present, they may not be able to transduce their signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Finally, the present study clearly demonstrates that a knowledge of the expression of ligand-specific receptors following brain injury is a fundamental step in clarifying the involvement of cytokines in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
