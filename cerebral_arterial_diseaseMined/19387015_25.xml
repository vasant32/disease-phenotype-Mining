<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The genetic cause of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> with subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> (CARASIL), which is characterized by ischemic, nonhypertensive, cerebral small-vessel disease with associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>alopecia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0004684'>spondylosis</z:mp>, is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In five families with CARASIL, we carried out linkage analysis, fine mapping of the region implicated in the disease, and sequence analysis of a candidate gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also conducted functional analysis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and mutant gene products and measured the signaling by members of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) family and gene and protein expression in the small arteries in the cerebrum of two patients with CARASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found linkage of the disease to the 2.4-Mb region on chromosome 10q, which contains the HtrA serine protease 1 (HTRA1) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HTRA1 is a serine protease that represses signaling by TGF-beta family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis revealed two nonsense mutations and two missense mutations in HTRA1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The missense mutations and one of the nonsense mutations resulted in protein products that had comparatively low levels of protease activity and did not repress signaling by the TGF-beta family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other nonsense mutation resulted in the loss of HTRA1 protein by nonsense-mediated decay of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of the cerebral small arteries in affected persons showed increased expression of the extra domain-A region of fibronectin and versican in the thickened tunica intima and of TGF-beta1 in the tunica media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CARASIL is associated with mutations in the HTRA1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate a link between repressed inhibition of signaling by the TGF-beta family and ischemic cerebral small-vessel disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>alopecia</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0004684'>spondylosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
