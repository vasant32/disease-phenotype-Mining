<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper reported clinical experience of intraarterial urokinase infusion therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or superacute <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The procedure was followed by angiographical study which revealed the major intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case 1: A 74-year-old female had sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of clouding of consciousness with complete left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient was in our urological ward because of treatment for her right <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041955" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ureter tumor</z:e>, as the patient was immediately subjected to angiographical study and complete occlusion of the trunk of the right middle cerebral artery was revealed four hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Successively 240,000 IU of urokinase solution was injected through the arterial catheter after angiographical study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This procedure repeated two times with 10 minute intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>So total amount of 720,000 IU of urokinase was given by intraarterial injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immediately after the last urokinase injection the patient started to recover her consciousness and <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous angiogram demonstrated partial recanalization of the proximal branches of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The following day, she had complete recovery from her neurological deficits although she had transient hemorrhagic tendency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The final angiogram showed no existence of obstructed cerebral arteries as well as no low density areas in computed tomographic images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Case 2: A 73-year-old female, with the left internal carotid occlusion at the site of C1-2 portion, was instituted infusion therapy of similar procedure with total amount of 960,000 IU oi urokinase ten to twenty hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
