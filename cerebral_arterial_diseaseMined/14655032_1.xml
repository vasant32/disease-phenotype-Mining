<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified 99 cases, and after reviewing the clinical records, classified 28 as asymptomatic MCAS (AMCAS), a prevalence of 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was the most frequent indication for MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was available for 21, mean 46.7 months (range 2.4-75.6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred in the AMCAS territory (5%), other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in five patients (24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were five <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in patients with MCAS; age &gt; 69 (P = 0.045) was the only associated risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that patients in whom MRA is performed and shows AMCAS may be at increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in any vascular distribution or of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
