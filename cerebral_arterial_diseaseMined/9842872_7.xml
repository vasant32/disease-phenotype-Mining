<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Osteolipomas are distinguished from other intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0012032'>lipomas</z:hpo> by their arrangement of central adipose and peripheral osseous tissues and by characteristically arising in the suprasellar/interpeduncular region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We report computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and pathology findings from this 34-year-old man who underwent surgical removal of this benign lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This case displays the distinctive histopathology that has been reported in 13 of 31 (42%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0012032'>lipomas</z:hpo> in this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, ossification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012032'>lipomas</z:hpo> at other intracranial sites is relatively rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ossification should be expected in many suprasellar/interpeduncular <z:hpo ids='HP_0012032'>lipomas</z:hpo>, and osteolipoma should be included in the radiologic differential diagnosis of fat-intensity masses with calcification in this region </plain></SENT>
