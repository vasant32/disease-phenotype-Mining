<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Characteristic changes in CADASIL can be observed onT2-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images in the subcortical white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to measure changes of regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) with dynamic contrast-enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and to correlate the changes to disability and cognitive performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We obtained rCBV measurements of 24 individuals with proven CADASIL on a 1.5-T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A susceptibility-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging sequence was used for bolus tracking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Principles of the indicator dilution theory were applied to estimate values of absolute rCBV (mL/100 g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Disability was determined by using the Rankin scale, and overall cognitive performance was assessed by using the Mini-Mental State Examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean rCBV in the subcortical white matter that was hyperintense on the T2-weighted images (2.7 +/- 0.8 mL/100 g) was significantly lower than the rCBV in the white matter that appeared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> on the T2-weighted images (4.4 +/- 1.3 mL/100 g) (P &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean rCBV in the gray matter was within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range (8.3 +/- 1.7 mL/100 g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and disability negatively correlated with rCBV in the subcortical white matter that was hyperintense (P &lt;.05) but not with rCBV in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearing white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>rCBV did not correlate with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: rCBV measured in the hyperintense subcortical white matter in individuals with CADASIL was decreased and inversely correlated with disability and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
