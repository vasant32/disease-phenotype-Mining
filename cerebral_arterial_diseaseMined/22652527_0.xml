<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ABI has been shown to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial disease</z:e> and prognosis following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the associations of the degree of ABI lowering with extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp>), intracranial large artery disease (ICLAD), and subsequent vascular events in a prospective cohort of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ABI, extracranial and intracranial cerebral arteries were assessed in a blinded manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ABI was categorized into 0.9-1.3 (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>), 0.8-0.89 (mildly lowered) and &lt;0.8 (severely lowered) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up data at 1 year were obtained from standardized telephone interviews and verified with medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 1311 patients, 73% had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ABI, 13% had ABI 0.8-0.89 and 13% had ABI &lt;0.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ABI, those with ABI&lt;0.8 had higher prevalence of severe <z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> (15% vs. 5%, p = 0.006) and ICLAD (72% vs. 48%, p = 0.003), even after adjustment for age, gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, smoking, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (severe <z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> p &lt; 0.001, ICLAD p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 1 year, patients with ABI &lt;0.8 had a higher incidence of composite vascular events (19% vs. 11%, p = 0.02), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (15% vs. 10%, p = 0.06) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (4% vs. 2%, p = 0.07) than patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ABI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients, large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial disease</z:e> and incidence of subsequent vascular events at 1 year were associated with severe ABI lowering &lt;0.8, but not with mild ABI lowering (0.8-0.89) </plain></SENT>
