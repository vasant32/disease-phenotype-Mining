<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the clinical and angiographic effects of endovascular treatment of 39 small (5mm) ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> (in 37 patients) at our institution between March 2004 and March 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Procedures were carried out on a biplane angiographic system with three-dimensional rotational digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immediately after embolization, 30 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were completely occluded and nine had a residual neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The volumetric percentage occlusion was 45.2+/-9.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiographic and clinical follow-up was at 6.1 months and 15.9 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Delayed rebleeding was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complications directly related to the procedure were encountered in two patients (one coil migration and one intraoperative rupture) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For 34 patients, the final outcome was excellent or good, one suffered a moderate disability, one a severe disability and one patient died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that endovascular embolization is effective and safe for patients with small ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
