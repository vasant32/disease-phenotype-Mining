We have used a recombinant phage library enriched for chromosome 22 sequences to isolate and characterize eight anonymous DNA probes detecting restriction fragment length polymorphisms on this autosome. These were used in conjunction with eight previously reported loci, including the genes BCR, IGLV, and PDGFB, four anonymous DNA markers, and the P1 blood group antigen, to construct a linkage map for chromosome 22. The linkage group is surprisingly large, spanning 97 cM on the long arm of the chromosome. There are no large gaps in the map; the largest intermarker interval is 14 cM. Unlike several other chromosomes, little overall difference was observed for sex-specific recombination rates on chromosome 22. The availability of a genetic map will facilitate investigation of chromosome 22 rearrangements in such disorders as cat eye syndrome and DiGeorge syndrome, deletions in acoustic neuroma and meningioma, and translocations in Ewing sarcoma. This defined set of linked markers will also permit testing chromosome 22 for the presence of particular disease genes by family studies and should immediately support more precise mapping and identification of flanking markers for NF2, the defective gene causing bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis.
