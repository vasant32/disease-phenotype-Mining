In a cytogenetic, molecular, and clinical study of patients with autosomal supernumerary marker chromosomes (SMC), 6 out of 72 (8.3%) were shown by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) to be derived from chromosome 22. PCR microsatellite analysis and FISH using primers and cosmids from proximal 22q showed 3 of the 6 to contain euchromatin. The first, a de novo nonmosaic bisatellited, dicentric SMC, was acsertained in a patient with cat eye syndrome and Duane anomaly. Microsatellite analysis showed the SMC was maternal in origin with euchromatin extending to D22S427, i.e., proximal to the DiGeorge syndrome critical region (DGSCR). The second, a nonmosaic bisatellited, dicentric marker, was found in a child with severe hypotonia and developmental delay and had been inherited from the patient's phenotypically normal father. FISH showed the SMC to contain euchromatin extending into the DGSCR. The third, a de novo SMC, was ascertained antenatally and was shown to contain 22q euchromatin extending distal to the DGSCR. The 19-week terminated fetus was phenotypically normal at autopsy. Two of the three SMC(22)s not containing detectable proximal 22q euchromatin were ascertained coincidentally in phenotypically normal individuals, whereas the third, the only mosaic with a minority euploid cell line, was found in a patient with mild developmental delay. These results suggest that SMC(22)s devoid of proximal 22q euchromatin are not associated with adverse phenotypic effects whereas SMC(22)s containing euchromatin may be found in individuals with phenotypes ranging from cat eye syndrome to normal.
