A small supernumerary marker chromosome (sSMC) derived from chromosome 22 is a relatively common cytogenetic finding. This sSMC typically results in tetrasomy for a chromosomal region that spans the chromosome 22p arm and the proximal 2 Mb of 22q11.21. Using classical cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, and array techniques, 7 patients with sSMCs derived from chromosome 22 were studied: 4 non-related and 3 from the same family (mother, daughter, and son). The sSMCs in all patients were dicentric and bisatellited chromosomes with breakpoints in the chromosome 22 low-copy repeat A region, resulting in cat eye syndrome (CES) due to chromosome 22 partial tetrasomy 22pterâ†’q11.2 including the cat eye chromosome region. Although all subjects presented the same chromosomal abnormality, they showed a wide range of phenotypic differences, even in the 3 patients from the same family. There are no previous reports of CES occurring within 3 patients in the same family. Thus, the clinical and follow-up data presented here contribute to a better delineation of the phenotypes and outcomes of CES patients and will be useful for genetic counseling.
