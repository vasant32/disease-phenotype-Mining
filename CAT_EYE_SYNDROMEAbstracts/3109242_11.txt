We have studied a mother and son with a previously apparently undescribed syndrome of microcephaly, eye defects, small ears, mild mental deficiency, and short stature. The syndrome appears to be an autosomal or X-linked dominant trait. The cat eye syndrome, blepharophimosis or Kohn-Romano syndrome, Rieger syndrome, and other disorders are discussed in relationship to this entity.
