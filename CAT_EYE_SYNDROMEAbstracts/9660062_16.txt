We present a female child with features of the CHARGE association, including iris coloboma, large ventricular septum defect (VSD), external ear abnormalities, severe growth retardation and moderate mental delay. A submicroscopic deletion in chromsome 22q11 was detected by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using probe DO832. The clinical features in this child compromise characteristics of both the velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS) and the cat-eye syndrome. This may suggest the presence of a more complex rearrangement of 22q, with a deletion-duplication.
