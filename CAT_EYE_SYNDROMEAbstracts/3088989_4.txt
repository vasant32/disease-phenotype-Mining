We investigated the breakpoints involved in the generation of the supernumerary bisatellited chromosome associated with the Cat Eye syndrome. In situ hybridization of DNA probes from band 22q11 revealed that, for two individuals with the Cat Eye syndrome, both breakpoints for the bisatellited chromosome were distal to the DNA sequence corresponding to probe D22S9 and proximal to the immunoglobulin C lambda genes and to at least one subgroup of the V lambda genes.
