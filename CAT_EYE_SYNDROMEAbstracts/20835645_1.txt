 OBJECTIVE: Cat eye syndrome is considered a rare chromosome disease with a highly variable phenotype. The objective of this paper was to describe the clinical characteristics of a sample of patients with cat eye syndrome who were seen at our service. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of a sample of six patients with diagnoses of cat eye syndrome. All of these patients’ karyotypes exhibited the presence of an additional marker chromosome, inv dup(22)(pter->q11.2::q11.2->pter). One patient also exhibited mosaicism with a lineage that had a normal chromosomal constitution. Clinical and follow-up data were collected from the patients’ medical records. Fisher’s exact test was used to compare the frequencies observed in our study with figures given in the literature (P<0.05). RESULTS: The main abnormalities observed were preauricular tags and/or pits and anal atresia (both observed in 83% of cases). Coloboma of the iris, an important finding with this syndrome, was observed in two cases (33%). Congenital heart disease was detected in four patients (67%) and the main defect found was interatrial communication (75%). Uncommon findings included hemifacial microsomia combined with unilateral microtia and biliary atresia. Just one of these patients died, from chylothorax and sepsis. CONCLUSION: The phenotype observed in cat eye syndrome is highly variable and may be superimposed on the phenotype of the oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum. Although these patients usually have good prognosis, including from a neurological point of view, we believe that all patients with the syndrome should be assessed very early on for the presence of cardiac, biliary and anorectal malformations, which may avoid possible complications in the future, including patient deaths.
