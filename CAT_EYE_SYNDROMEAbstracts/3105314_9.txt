Except for atypical eye findings in the daughter, a mother and daughter with bisatellited marker chromosomes had abnormalities consistent with cat-eye syndrome. The mother's marker chromosome (mar number 1) is derived from one 22 and another acrocentric, possibly also a 22; the daughter's marker (mar number 2) may be an iso-dicentric, inv-dup (22) derivative of mar number 1. The mother has a tertiary trisomy translocation chromosome composed of at least one and perhaps two copies of 22pter----q11.2, whereas the daughter clearly has a secondary trisomy 22pter----q11.2 isochromosome, confirming this region as a cause of cat-eye syndrome. Results of hybridization using a unique sequence probe localized to 22q11 are consistent with the interpretation that both ends of both marker chromosomes are derived from 22.
