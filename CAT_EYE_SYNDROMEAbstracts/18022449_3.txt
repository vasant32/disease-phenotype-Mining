Phenotypically healthy carriers of the balanced 11;22 translocation, the most frequent non-Robertsonian constitutional translocation known in human beings, are at risk of having a progeny with supernumerary derivative (22)t(11;22) syndrome [der(22) syndrome]. We present the cases of 2 male patients with supernumerary der(22) syndrome [47,XY,+der(22)t(11;22)(q23;q11.2)mat], yielding partial trisomy for 22pter-q11 and 11q23-qter. These cases expand the phenotype of the der(22) syndrome, with the first case highlighting the phenotypic overlap of VACTERL and the second adding Hirschsprung's disease and intestinal malrotation to the list of associated anorectal anomalies. Because der(22) syndrome and cat eye syndrome (partial tetrasomy of 22q11) share a similar region of extra dosage on 22q11 and both typically manifest an anorectal phenotype, a dosage-sensitive gene for anorectal anomalies may be present in this locus.
