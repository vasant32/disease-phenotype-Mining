The presence of chromosome-specific low-copy repeats (LCRs) predisposes chromosome 22 to deletions and duplications. The current diagnostic procedure for detecting aberrations at 22q11.2 is chromosomal analysis coupled with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or PCR-based multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA). However, there are copy number variations (CNVs) in 22q11.2 that are only detected by high-resolution platforms such as array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). We report on development of a high-definition MLPA (MLPA-HD) 22q11 kit that detects copy number changes at 37 loci on the long arm of chromosome 22. These include the 3-Mb region commonly deleted in DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome (DGS/VCFS), the cat eye syndrome (CES) region, and more distal regions in 22q11 that have recently been shown to be deleted. We have used this MLPA-HD probe set to analyze 363 previously well-characterized samples with a variety of different rearrangements at 22q11 and demonstrate that it can detect copy number alterations with high sensitivity and specificity. In addition to detection of the common recurrent deletions associated with DGS/VCFS, variant and novel chromosome 22 aberrations have been detected. These include duplications within as well as deletions distal to this region. Further, the MLPA-HD detects deletion endpoint differences between patients with the common 3-Mb deletion. The MLPA-HD kit is proposed as a cost effective alternative to the currently available detection methods for individuals with features of the 22q11 aberrations. In patients with the relevant phenotypic characteristics, this MLPA-HD probe set could replace FISH for the clinical diagnosis of 22q11.2 deletions and duplications.
