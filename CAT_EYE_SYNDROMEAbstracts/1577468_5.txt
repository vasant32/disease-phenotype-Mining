DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) is a human developmental defect of the structures derived from the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches. It apparently arises due to deletion of 22q11. We describe a strategy for the isolation of DNA probes for this region. A deleted chromosome 22, which includes 22q11, was flow-sorted from a lymphoblastoid cell line of a patient with cat eye syndrome and used as the source of DNA. A DNA library was constructed from this chromosome by cloning into the EcoR1 site of the vector Lambda gt10. Inserts were amplified by PCR and mapped using a somatic cell hybrid panel of this region. Out of 32 probes, 14 were mapped to 22q11. These probes were further sublocalised within the region by dosage analysis of DGS patients, and by the use of two new hybrid cell lines which we have produced from DGS patients. One of these lines (7939B662) contains the altered human chromosome segregated from its normal homologue. This chromosome 22 contains an interstitial deletion in 22q11, and will be useful for localising further probes to the DGS region.
