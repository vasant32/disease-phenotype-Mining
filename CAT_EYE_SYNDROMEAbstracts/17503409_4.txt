Neuronal differentiation (ND) represents a well-defined phenomenon in biological terms but proteins involved have not been studied systematically. We therefore aimed to study ND by retinoic acid (RA) in a widely used neuroblastoma cell line by comparative proteomics. The ND was induced in the N1E-115 cell line by serum deprivation and RA treatment. Undifferentiated cells and cells undergoing serum deprivation served as controls. Protein extracts were run on 2-DE followed by MALDI-TOF or MALDI-TOF-TOF analysis. Quantification was carried out using specific software and stringent statistical analysis was performed. Tubulin beta 5, cat eye syndrome critical region protein 5 homolog, putative GTP-binding protein PTD004 homolog, and the metabolic proteins glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and transketolase were differentially regulated. Differential protein levels of cytoskeleton proteins including tubulins and metabolic proteins have been reported to be regulated by ND. Herein, specific signaling differences as reflected by putative GTP-binding protein PTD004 changes in differentiated cells are shown and a possible role for the Cat eye syndrome critical region protein 5 homolog is proposed. The protein disulfide isomerase associated 3 protein fits the already proposed findings of chaperon regulation by ND. The study forms the molecular basis for further evaluation of the functional roles of the differentially expressed proteins in ND.
