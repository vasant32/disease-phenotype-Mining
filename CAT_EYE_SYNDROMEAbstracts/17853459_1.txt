Supernumerary marker chromosomes (SMCs) have a reported frequency in the prenatal and newborn population ranging from 0.04% to 0.08% and about 37% of diagnosed SMCs are associated with an abnormal phenotype. Around 7.5% of them are derived from chromosome 22. SMCs(22) that result in tri- or tetrasomy of band 22q11.2 are associated with Cat-eye syndrome (CES), a syndrome of variable penetrance and affectation. CES-like phenotype has been also related to 22q11.2 interstitial duplications and der(22) syndrome. The 22q11.2 region, also involved in the velocardiofacial microdeletional syndrome, presents high susceptibility to chromosomal rearrangements due to the presence of low-copy repeats sequences (LCR22). Another region in the genome rich in LCR is 17p and five recurrent disorders have been mapped on the region 17p11-p13. Some chromosomal imbalances affecting the 17p13.3 subtelomeric region have been reported, related to cryptic unbalanced translocations and associated, in most cases, to mental retardation and dysmorphic features. We report on a healthy male carrier of a SMC that was identified as a +der(22)t(17;22)(p13.3;q11.2) consequence of an abnormal 3:1 segregation of the paternal t(17;22) and we have determined the approximate size of the trisomic regions, comparing the obtained results with other reported imbalances involving 22q11.2 and 17pter.
