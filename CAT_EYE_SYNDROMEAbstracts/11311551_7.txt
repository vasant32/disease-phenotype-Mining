Adenosine deaminase (ADA) catalyzes the hydrolysis of adenosine to inosine. Its lack determines severe combined immunodeficiency in mammals, possibly due to accumulation of extracellular adenosine, which induces apoptosis in lymphocytes (Franco et al., 1998). Thus, presence of normal levels of ADA leads to normal growth and proliferation of lymphocytes. Several vertebrate and microbial ADA amino-acid sequences are known, with substantial similarity to each other. On the other hand, there are invertebrate growth factors as well as a candidate gene for the human cat eye syndrome (CECR1) (Riazi et al., 2000. Genomics 64, 277-285), which share substantial similarity to each other, and also to ADA. In this study, we report the expression and ADA enzymatic activity of a cDNA from the salivary glands of Lutzomyia longipalpis, a blood-sucking insect, with substantial similarity to insect growth factors and to human CECR1. We also demonstrate the existence of a subfamily of the adenosine deaminase family characterized by their unique amino-terminal region. Both Drosophila melanogaster and humans have both types of adenosine deaminases. Results indicate that these invertebrate proteins previously annotated as growth factors, as well as the human CECR1 gene product, may exert their actions through adenosine depletion. The different roles played by each type of adenosine deaminase in humans and Drosophila remains to be fully investigated.
