In a series of 10,000 prenatal diagnoses 15 marker chromosomes were detected in our centre. Six of these were familial whilst nine had originated de novo. They were analysed with various staining methods. DA-DAPI staining was positive in nine out of 12 pregnancies. Six pregnancies were continued. Five normal children were born, one ended in intrauterine fetal death of a normal fetus at 37 weeks. Nine pregnancies were terminated, showing six normal fetuses, one familial cat-eye syndrome, one fetus with Down syndrome caused by additional trisomy 21 and one fetus with cystic kidneys resp. It is concluded that it seems safe to continue the pregnancy in cases of familial marker, identical to that of one parent, whilst a de novo DA-DAPI positive marker seems to present a low risk for fetal anomalies.
