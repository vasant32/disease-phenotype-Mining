Two cloned DNA fragments, one derived from an alpha satellite subfamily common to chromosomes 13 and 21, and the other derived from a similar subfamily common to chromosomes 14 and 22, have been used as biotinylated probes in in situ hybridization studies. Under high stringency conditions, chromosome specific centromeric labelling can be obtained. The applications of this technique in clinical situations are illustrated on metaphases from a fetus with trisomy 21, a fetus with trisomy 13, and a child with clinical features of cat-eye syndrome.
