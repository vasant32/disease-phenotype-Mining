In a cyanotic newborn with characteristic features of Cat-Eye-Syndrome, cytogenetic examination disclosed a supernumerary small bisatellited chromosome. Angiography showed Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia and a narrow patent ductus arteriosus with additional stenosis of the bifurcation of the pulmonary artery. At an age of 14 weeks, the patient died after the attempt of corrective cardiac surgery. Congenital cardiac malformation is present in more than one third of patients with cat-eye-syndrome and is usually the lifelimiting malformation in this syndrome.
