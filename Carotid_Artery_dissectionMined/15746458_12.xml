<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rapid stenting followed by antiplatelet therapy may prevent complications when anticoagulation therapy is not applicable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with angiographically proven traumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> and hemodynamic significant hemispheric hypoperfusion, or in whom <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy was either contraindicated or failed clinically, were regarded as being at high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and were selected for stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten patients with traumatic dissection underwent stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endovascular treatment reduced mean dissection stenosis from 69% to 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During a mean clinical follow-up time of 16 months, none had additional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Doppler ultrasound studies did not detect any signs of de novo in-stent stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In selected cases of traumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissections</z:e>, endovascular stent-assisted angioplasty immediately restored the integrity of the vessel lumen and prevented efficiently the occurrence of new ischemic events, without additional anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
