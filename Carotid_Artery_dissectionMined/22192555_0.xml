<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Post-partum cervicocephalic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissection</z:e> (pp-CAD) is a rare and poorly understood condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, only 21 cases have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reversible cerebral segmental vasoconstriction (RCSV) was first described by Call and Fleming in 1988, and its association with pp-CAD has only been reported in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in those cases it is unclear whether the pp-CAD may have been caused by straining during labor and therefore merely coincidental to the intracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We describe a 41-year-old right-handed African-American woman who developed the syndrome of pp-CAD (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>, trace <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and diffuse cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> on angiogram) two weeks after delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this unique case, the patient had fortuitously undergone an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> study twice over a four day period which included the carotid bifurcations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During that time the patient was an inpatient, on bed rest and subject to continuous cardiac monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The interval studies documented a true spontaneous right <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> occurring without obvious cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient had noted moderate right neck pain developing between the two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> studies but experienced no neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subsequent conventional angiography confirmed the presence of postpartum cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> and the cervical dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient was managed conservatively with antiplatelet medication and had an otherwise uneventful course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize whether transient arterial wall abnormalities, postpartum hormonal changes or subtle connective tissue aberrations play a similar role in the pathogenesis of these two associated conditions </plain></SENT>
