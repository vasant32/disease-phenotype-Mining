<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The authors compared the hemodynamic and morphologic properties of the carotid artery, as assessed noninvasively by ultrasonography, in patients with spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> (ICAD) and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Twenty-six patients who experienced ICAD more than 6 months before evaluation were compared with 26 controls matched for age, sex, and height </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases and controls had ultrasound measurement of common carotid artery diameter and diameter change during the cardiac cycle, bulbar and suprabulbar internal carotid artery diameters, and common carotid artery intima-media thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The unaffected carotid artery in cases was compared with the carotid artery of the same side in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Common carotid artery relative diameter change was significantly higher in cases than controls, whereas other measurements were not significantly different between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, the highest tertile of common carotid artery relative diameter change was associated with the risk of ICAD (OR, 10.0; 95% CI, 1.8 to 54.2; p = 0.002) CONCLUSION: An underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e>, presumably related to an extracellular matrix defect, may be present in patients with spontaneous ICAD </plain></SENT>
