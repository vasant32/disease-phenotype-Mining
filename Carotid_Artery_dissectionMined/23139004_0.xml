<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a case with delayed diagnosis of traumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> in a 21-year-old female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While there were no ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> findings on the admission cerebral computerized tomography (CT), such findings were observed on two cerebral CTs taken because of the left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> noticed seven days later when the patient regained consciousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient was referred to our emergency service, and definitive diagnosis was achieved with arterial Doppler ultrasonography, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion MRI, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We did not consider invasive treatment since the neurological damage was permanent and dissection grade was IV according to angiography findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The case was discharged within a week and physiotherapy was advised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite the advances in diagnostic methods, diagnosis of traumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> is still missed or delayed, as in the case presented here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis can ameliorate permanent neurological damage or even prevent it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the vital factors for early diagnosis are the obtained anamnesis leading to appropriate radiological examinations, detailed physical examination and high clinical suspicion </plain></SENT>
