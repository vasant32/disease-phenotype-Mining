<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardinal symptoms were: 1) focal disturbances of the cerebral circulation (n = 28); 2) unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> or neck pain (n = 20); 3) incomplete <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo> (n = 9) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had abnormal Doppler ultrasound findings over the ICA; in 22 there were markedly reduced flow velocities and retrograde flow components ("to- and- fro" phenomenon), typical of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During a mean observation time of 6.9 +/- 5.7 months serial Doppler ultrasound and angiographic examinations demonstrated recanalization in 73% after an average of 56 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiographically different types (long segments in 13; pseudo-occlusions in 7; pseudoaneurysms in 5; and distal stenoses in 6; others in 2) are interpreted as expressions of different stages in the development of dissection up to complete recanalization </plain></SENT>
