<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Earlier studies have highlighted risk factors for perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after carotid endarterectomy, such as female sex, preoperative symptoms, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the relationship between these factors and perioperative microembolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 235 patients were entered in the study at two centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler ultrasound scanning was possible in 190 patients (81%) and was performed for 1 hour preoperatively and continuously intraoperatively as a means of detecting microemboli and monitoring mean middle cerebral artery velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings of transcranial Doppler ultrasound scanning were related to perioperative risk factors by means of univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microemboli were detected in 28 (15%), 79 (42%), and 98 (52%) patients preoperatively, during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e>, and after closure of the artery, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Having 10 or more emboli after carotid artery closure was more common in women (P = .04) and in patients with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> (P = .04) and was demonstrated in three of the six patients who had a perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These three patients also had preoperative evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and an intraoperative middle cerebral artery velocity less than 40 cm/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study, perioperative microembolization was more common in women and patients with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings may explain the increased risk of carotid surgery in these patients </plain></SENT>
