<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (5.2%) had a syndrome of lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsies</z:hpo> (with invariable involvement of cranial nerve XII with or without additional involvement of cranial nerves XI, X, and IX), seven (3.7%) had palsy of cranial nerve V, and five (2.6%) had a syndrome of ocular motor palsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Palsy of cranial nerve VIII and ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo> occurred in one patient each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients had dysgeusia without other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001291'>cranial nerve involvement</z:hpo>, presumably due to involvement of the chorda tympani nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> or face pain (often unilateral) was present in 83% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other associated manifestations were cerebral ischemic symptoms, bruits, or oculosympathetic palsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one patient, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsy</z:hpo> was the only manifestation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e>, and in another patient, the disease presented only as a palsy of cranial nerve XII and oculosympathetic palsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In six patients, a syndrome of hemicrania and ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsy</z:hpo> was the sole manifestation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>Cranial nerve palsy</z:hpo> is not rare in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compression or stretching of the nerve by the expanded artery may explain some but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the palsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An alternative mechanism is likely interruption of the nutrient vessels supplying the nerve </plain></SENT>
