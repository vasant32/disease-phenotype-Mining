<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results showed concordance of MRI and angiographic findings, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases but one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dissected portion consistently showed a semilunar hyperintensity narrowing the residual eccentric signal void of the lumen when the artery was not completely occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one angiographically occluded vessel, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> detected a small signal void within the hyperintensity, indicating that the artery was not completely occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The length of the dissected portion was clearly demonstrated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow up <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and angiographic studies confirmed the regression of the dissection, and also allowed examination of the cerebral parenchyma </plain></SENT>
