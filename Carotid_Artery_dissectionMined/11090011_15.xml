<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment options include observation, anticoagulation and endovascular stenting, and aggressive surgical repair of the carotid artery injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blunt traumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissections</z:e> were reviewed through a retrospective study of trauma registry records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven patients were identified from 3342 patients over 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six patients were identified incidentally during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cervical spine/brain screening and one patient during angiographic evaluation for possible penetrating neck injury without MRI/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 189 patients underwent MRI screening over this 3-year period, demonstrating a relative incidence of 3.7 per cent, contrasting with the reported incidence of 0.08 to 0.4 per cent for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> trauma patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> seven patients suffered severe head injuries (mean Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Score = 4.7) requiring mean intensive care unit and hospital stays of 15.6 and 23.7 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the patients showed evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with CT scanning on presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the patients demonstrated clinical focal neurologic signs or symptoms indicating carotid injury or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six patients survived their <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> trauma and were discharged to rehabilitation after initiation of observation (one patient) or anticoagulation (five patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> six patients showed neurological improvement without deterioration clinically or radiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion we propose early aggressive screening through MRI/MRA of severely injured patients to detect occult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conservative medical treatment for this occult injury has been effective in this series of patients </plain></SENT>
