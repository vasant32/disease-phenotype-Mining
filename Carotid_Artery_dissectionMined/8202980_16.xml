<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Redundant internal carotid arteries have been considered a risk factor in tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, and surgical treatment of peritonsillar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> and also a potentially treatable cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, an association between internal carotid artery redundancy and spontaneous dissection has not yet been clearly demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed, for spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e>, records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients admitted to our institution during the period from 1986 through 1992 with the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also reviewed 108 percutaneous cerebral arteriograms performed between September 1992 and December 1992 for presence of carotid artery redundancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen patients exhibited spontaneous dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, 8 of 13 (62%) patients and 13 of 20 (65%) internal carotid arteries, viewed to the siphon, had significant redundancies, kinks, coils, or loops </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 108 consecutive arteriograms of patients without dissection, in which 187 internal carotid arteries were viewed to the siphon, there were 20 (19%) patients and 22 (12%) of 187 vessels with significant redundancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients in the dissection group and 2 in the nondissection group had bilateral internal carotid artery redundancy (P = .0019 and P = .0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found a significant correlation between internal carotid artery redundancy and dissection, particularly if redundancy is present bilaterally </plain></SENT>
