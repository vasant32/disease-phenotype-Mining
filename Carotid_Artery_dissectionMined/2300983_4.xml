<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first patient, a 36-year-old man, had involvement of the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th cranial nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second case was a 53-year-old man with abnormalities of the 5th, 7th, 9th, 10th, and 12th cranial nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both, magnetic resonance imaging revealed a ring-like area of abnormal signal intensity surrounding the carotid artery at the skull base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carotid angiography was consistent with the suggestion of dissection on the magnetic resonance studies in both cases </plain></SENT>
