<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, it may lead to a wide range of associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurologic abnormalities</z:hpo>: The central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system is usually involved because of softening of bone at the base of the skull, with resultant upward migration of the upper cervical spine and odontoid process into the skull base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Upward migration of the spine may cause compression of the brainstem, mechanical impingement of the spinal canal with restriction of cerebrospinal fluid circulation, and impingement of the cranial nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029434" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Osteogenesis imperfecta</z:e> also may directly involve neurovascular structures, leading to cavernous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> of the carotid artery, dissection of the cervical arteries, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The brain parenchyma is frequently affected by the disease, with manifestations including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001334'>communicating hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001321'>cerebellar hypoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The imaging features of the disorder vary as widely as its clinical manifestations, depending on the severity of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severe forms accompanied by debilitating skeletal fractures and progressive neurologic impairments may lead to perinatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, whereas milder asymptomatic forms might cause only a modest reduction in life span </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most important advance in medical therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029434" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteogenesis imperfecta</z:e> has been the introduction of bisphosphonate therapy to slow the resorption of bone in patients with moderate to severe forms of the disease (ie, type III or IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In some patients, neurosurgery may be necessary to correct the effects of severe basilar invagination by the odontoid process </plain></SENT>
