<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We attempted to evaluate the sensitivity of helical CT for the diagnosis of extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixteen consecutive patients with 18 angiographically confirmed extracranial ICA dissections were studied with a helical CT protocol with large-volume acquisition and thin axial slice reconstructions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A control group including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and atherosclerotic ICAs was formed for comparison, and a blind interpretation of CT images was made by two observers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the presence of stenosis, eccentric lumen, mural thickening, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, occlusion, and annular contrast enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the artery seemed to be occluded, we measured the external diameter of the ICA (1) on the occluded side, at its upper portion and most enlarged level, (2) at its lower portion, beyond the bulb, and (3) on the contralateral side, at is upper portion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Interobserver agreement was good except for the presence of annular contrast enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the stenotic dissection group (n=12), the presence of a narrowed eccentric lumen at the upper portion of the ICA on axial CT images was classified correctly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An arterial wall thickening was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of dissection but also in three cases of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the occlusive dissection group (n=6), the enlargement of the dissected artery was the best criterion (sensitivity, 100%, specificity, 100%) for occlusive dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Helical CT seems to be a reliable method for evaluating extracranial ICA dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The analysis of the residual arterial lumen and the measurement of the external diameter of the carotid artery were the best criteria for the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies with larger groups are required to determine whether ICA dissections might be diagnosed using helical CT as a first procedure </plain></SENT>
