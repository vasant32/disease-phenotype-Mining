<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a 29-year-old male with traumatic internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> developed after removal of a left <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> and external decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CT scans 4 days after the operation showed infarctions of the distribution of the bilateral cerebral hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography on the 11th hospital day demonstrated narrowing of the extracranial internal carotid artery at C1-C2 vertebral levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Slight arterial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and retention of the contrast medium were found just above the narrowing segment, which was suspected to be a pseudolumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three D time-of flight MRA showed an intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> corresponding to the narrowing on the angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Original axial MRA images showed that narrowing of the lumen was surrounded by a crescent <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> and that two flow velocity areas were in the area distal to the narrowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High flow seemed to be ordinary artery flow rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The low flow area, including turbulent flow, led to the retention of contrast medium mimicking a pseudolumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Precise MRA imaging will bring us an accurate diagnosis of extracranial carotid dissections </plain></SENT>
