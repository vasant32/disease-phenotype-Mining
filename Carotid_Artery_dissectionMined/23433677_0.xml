<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: Direct puncture may offer an alternative access for embolization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> in patients presenting with tortuous vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, major complications such as compressive <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> can occur with this technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A tight common carotid artery (CCA) dissection was seen secondary to direct puncture in a 72-year-old patient who presented with a ruptured anterior communicating artery (ACom) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After regular coiling of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and using a femoral approach, an Angio-Sealâ„¢ device (St Jude Medical, Saint Paul, MN, USA) was placed and a carotid wallstent (Stryker Neurovascular, Fremont, CA, USA) successfully deployed at the dissected CCA, which was followed by good clinical and angiographic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A combined rescue technique combining Angio-Seal insertion and stent deployment was safe and effective for managing iatrogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
