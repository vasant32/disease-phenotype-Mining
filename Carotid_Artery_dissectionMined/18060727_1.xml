<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anatomic vascular complexity may be an important reason for the high reported rates of periprocedural thromboembolic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transcervical carotid angioplasty and stenting (TCS) with flow reversal avoids aortic arch instrumentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed our experience with TCS in octogenarian patients and compared the results with those of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in the same age group in terms of safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 81 patients, &gt; or =80 years, a retrospective cohort of 45 consecutive patients treated with CEA (January 2002 to January 2005), and a prospective cohort of 36 consecutive patients treated with TCS with protective flow reversal (January 2005 to January 2007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were considered symptomatic according to the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stenting indication was established on the SAPPHIRE criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>General anesthesia was used in patients undergoing CEA, and local anesthesia in those receiving TCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Primary endpoints were: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> within 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints were peripheral nerve <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> and cervical <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Statistical significance for between-group differences was assessed by Pearson chi(2) or Fisher exact test, and Student t test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A P value of &lt;.05 was considered statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was limited to 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline epidemiological characteristics and revascularization indications were similar between both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Mean age was significantly higher in the TCS group (83.5 +/- 3.35) than the CEA group (81.7 +/- 1.55) (P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Percentage of symptomatic lesions was similar: 30.6% in TCS vs 44.4% in CEA (P = .2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Comorbid conditions (respiratory or cardiac) were more frequent in TCS group (61.6% vs 26.6%; P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between groups for the primary endpoints: 4.4% (one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>) for CEA vs 0% for TCS (P = .5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Among CEA patients, there were two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142028" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">peripheral nerve palsies</z:e> (4.4%) and one cervical <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> (2.2%); there were no such complications with TCS (P = .5 and P = 1, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In one asymptomatic TCS patient, Doppler study at 24 hours following the procedure showed a common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e>, which was treated by a common carotid to internal carotid bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary experience, transcervical carotid angioplasty and stenting with flow reversal for cerebral protection was as safe at short term as carotid endarterectomy in octogenarian patients, who additionally had considerable comorbidity; thus, it may be possible to extend the indications for carotid revascularization in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Studies in larger patient series are required to confirm the trends observed in this study </plain></SENT>
