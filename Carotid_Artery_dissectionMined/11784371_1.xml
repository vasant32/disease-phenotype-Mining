<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven young (&lt;50 years old) patients with spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> in 11 cases and carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in 16 cases were evaluated to determine the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the DNA analysis the epsilon3/epsilon3 genotype was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with dissection, in 13 of 16 (81.2%) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and in 27 of 30 (90%) controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three of 16 (18.8%) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and 3 of 30 (10%) controls presented with the epsilon4/epsilon3 genotype, and this difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, observation of the epsilon4/epsilon3 genotype was not significantly higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> compared with those with dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No homozygote epsilon4/epsilon4, epsilon2/epsilon2 or heterozygote epsilon2 genotype was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between the presence of the epsilon4/epsilon3 genotype and vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the epsilon4 allele seems to be involved in carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0004416'>premature atherosclerosis</z:hpo> development whereas it may appear to be protective for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissection</z:e> occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A larger sample size is needed to support this suggestion </plain></SENT>
