<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Spontaneous or traumatic dissection of the internal carotid artery with resultant lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsies</z:hpo> is well documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, dissection of the external carotid artery with lower cranial palsies has not been reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old man experienced an <z:hpo ids='HP_0100310'>epidural hematoma</z:hpo> as the result of a fall and underwent a craniotomy and <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, he developed dysgeusia and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">difficulty in swallowing</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a dilated linear structure, with isosignal intensity on T1-weighted images and hyperintense signal intensity on T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Strong enhancement was seen on postcontrast T1-weighted images, indicating a dissected internal maxillary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was confirmed on selective angiography of the left common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Guglielmi detachable coils were introduced into the false lumen of the dissected artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, 0.5 ml of glue mixed with Lipiodol (Lafayette Pharmacal, Lafayette, IN) was packed into the remnant of the false lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Repeat angiograms demonstrated complete occlusion of the dissected vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and the neurological deficits gradually improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We describe the first reported case of internal maxillary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissection</z:e> and pseudoaneurysm presenting with isolated glossopharyngeal nerve palsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsy</z:hpo> and dissection of the external carotid artery branch may be the result of a compressive mechanism, as suggested by its anatomic relationships, the characteristics of the dissection, and the good prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Endovascular embolization of the external <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> and pseudoaneurysm is suggested as an effective therapeutic method for improving or alleviating neurological deficits produced by mass effect </plain></SENT>
