<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> presentation of Raeder's syndrome due to spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>True trigeminal dysfunction due to carotid dissection is rare, and the potential mechanisms for its involvement are reviewed in this paper </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Finally, we remind clinicians to consider dissection in the differential diagnosis of Raeder's syndrome because of its potential for ischemic cerebral neurologic sequelae and suggest early cranial and neck imaging in the evaluation of such patients </plain></SENT>
