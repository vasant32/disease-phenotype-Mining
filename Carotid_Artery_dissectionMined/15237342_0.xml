<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To use the magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) phase-contrast technique as a non-invasive method to determine blood volume flow in internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection, which has variable initial volume flow reduction and long term hemodynamic compromise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ICA dissection can lead to partial or complete recanalization or persistent occlusion, and strong clinical motivation exists for reliable assessment of the blood flow, in particular blood volume flow, in the carotid artery circulation after ICA dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood volume flow in the carotid artery circulation was quantified in 28 patients with unilateral ICA dissection and 20 age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood volume flow was measured in the ICAs and the common carotid arteries (CCAs) using 2D cine phase-contrast <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Final measurements were performed until after at least 6 months the hemodynamic compromise showed no changes by ultrasound and MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In long term follow up, 11/28 patients demonstrated remaining vessel occlusion, 10/28 partial and 7/28 complete recanalizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with ICA occlusion showed a significant contralateral volume flow increase (mean 56 %, p &lt; 0.001) in comparison to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with partial recanalization demonstrated volume flow rates between 24 ml/min and 188 ml/min in the dissected ICA and a less but significant (p &lt; 0.001) increase in the contralateral volume flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with complete recanalization, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volume flow conditions were found for both ICAs and CCAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In ICA dissection, quantitative volume flow determination using 2D cine phase-contrast <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging is helpful in the initial assessment and long term follow-up of hemodynamic compromise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ICA dissection demonstrated a partial or complete recanalization in nearly (2/3) of the investigated patients and a persisting vessel occlusion in little more than (1/3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Compensatory contralateral increase in volume flow was found </plain></SENT>
