<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is an idiopathic, segmental, non-inflammatory and non-atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> leading to stenosis of small- and medium-sized arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations are determined by the artery involved, most commonly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (renal artery) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (carotid artery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When FMD affects multiple vascular beds, it may mimic a systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we present the case of a young female patient with FMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient had a clinical history of bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> that required surgical repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since a systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> was suspected, abdominal angiography was done, showing evidence of a "string of beads" appearance involving the distal two-thirds of the right renal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This lesion is considered to be pathognomonic of the medial FMD that accounts for 70-95% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of FMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two years later, a new magnetic resonance angiography confirmed the "string of beads" appearance of the middle to distal part of the right renal artery, with significant hemodynamic stenosis that was successfully dilated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty </plain></SENT>
