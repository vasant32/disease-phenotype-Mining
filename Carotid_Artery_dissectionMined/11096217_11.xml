<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term outcome after extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> (eICAD) in consideration of the applied antithrombotic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Among 33 consecutive eICAD patients initially treated either with anticoagulation (n = 25) or with antiplatelets (n = 8), a standardized interview was performed after 28 +/- 22.1 months to analyze risks and benefits of both agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ischemic and hemorrhagic complications, occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> and rates of arterial recanalization were compared and long-term clinical outcome was assessed using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Barthel Index (BI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among anticoagulated patients, 1 died due to brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n = 2) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (n = 1) recurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the antiplatelet group, none died and no subsequent ischemic events happened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic complications were noted in neither treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome among anticoagulated patients was BI 92 +/- 21.6 and mRS 1.48 +/- 1.50, which did not differ from patients initially treated with antiplatelets (BI 89 +/- 18.9, mRS 1.50 +/- 1.41, p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four anticoagulated patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, compared to 2 patients with antiplatelets (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Arterial recanalization occurred in 16 of 22 antico- agulated patients with ultrasound follow-up, compared to 6 of 6 patients with antiplatelets (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the absence of iatrogenic side effects, both anticoagulation and antiplatelets seem to be safe for eICAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were low and outcome ratings did not differ between both agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings may indicate that a controlled randomized trial comparing anticoagulation and antiplatelets is ethically justified </plain></SENT>
