<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few data exist regarding the detection of high-intensity transient signals in dissected carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, 6 patients with spontaneous carotid dissection, defined by magnetic resonance techniques and duplex sonography, were examined by TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both middle cerebral arteries were monitored simultaneously for 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four of the patients had ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, while 2 presented with other symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High-intensity transient signals were detected in the middle cerebral artery ipsilateral to the dissection in 3 of the 4 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and in none of the patients with other presenting symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No microemboli were found contralateral to the dissected arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microemboli can be detected distally from dissected carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present findings support the assumption that embolism is a major cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with carotid dissection, and suggest that high-intensity transient signals are more common among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> secondary to dissection </plain></SENT>
