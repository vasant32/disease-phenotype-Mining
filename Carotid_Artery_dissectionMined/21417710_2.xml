<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective review of data at Millard Fillmore Gates Hospital identified 43 patients with 44 CADs (intracranial and/or extracranial) treated with carotid artery (CA) stent placement between January 2000 and June 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-two CADs were spontaneous and 12 were traumatic; 35 were symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lesion locations included the extracranial internal CA (ICA; 24 cases), extracranial ICA with common CA involvement (4 cases), and extracranial ICA-intracranial ICA (16 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was 100% in 15 cases (34.1%), 99% in 6 cases (13.6%), 70%-98% in 13 cases (29.5%), and &lt; 70% in 10 cases (22.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients suffered pseudoaneurysms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stent deployment was successful in 43 (97.7%) of 44 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean pretreatment score on the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale was 6.2 Â± 6.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recanalization (Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> Grade 2 or 3) was accomplished for 42 lesions (95.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients demonstrated residual parent vessel stenosis (10%-50% in severity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Procedure-related complications occurred in 7 patients and included middle <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral artery embolism</z:e> (1 patient), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (2 patients), worsening of dissection (1 patient), stent malpositioning (1 patient), embolic protection filter overload (1 patient), and filter retrieval device fracture (1 patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only 2 of these complications caused permanent deficits: the embolism caused a minor but permanent neurological deficit, and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> was fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At discharge, 36 patients (83.7%) had modified Rankin Scale scores of 0-2 (favorable outcome) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up interval (mean 19.2 months, range 4-92 months), no patient suffered a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 1 patient died secondary to preexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In 20 patients with angiographic follow-up, permanent resolution of the dissection was noted in 90.5%; 2 lesions (9.5%) required retreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular stent-assisted repair of extra- and intracranial CAD was safe and effective in this experience and can be recommended for selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In particular, patients with symptomatic CADs that are not responsive to medical therapy should be considered for interventional treatment </plain></SENT>
