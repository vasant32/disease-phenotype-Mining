<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy may be ineffective or contraindicated; surgery impractical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present our experience with endovascular stenting in CAD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 2004 to 2011, 23 patients with angiographically proven traumatic CAD underwent endovascular stent-assisted arterial reconstruction based on clinical and radiographic criteria: contraindication or failure of anticoagulation, evidence of impending <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, or need for urgent intracranial revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dissections were graded based on degree of stenosis and extent of injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen patients (73.9%) presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Carotid revascularization was achieved with one (11 patients, 48%) or multiple stents (12 patients, 52%); distal protection was used rarely (three patients, 13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No complications were directly attributed to stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean dissection-related stenosis improved from 72% ± 28.87% to 4% ± 8.29% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At a mean clinical follow-up of 28.7 months ± 31.9 months, 16 patients (69.6%) improved, six (26.1%) remained stable, and one (4.3%) had died secondary to multiple traumatic injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At long-term follow-up, no patient had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or presented evidence of de novo in-stent stenosis or stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no neurologic sequelae after partial or total discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy in seven patients undergoing trauma-related surgeries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Selected cases of traumatic CAD can be safely managed by endovascular stent-assisted angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Procedural complications are infrequent; the need for postprocedure antiplatelet therapy is a concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Early detection is essential to avoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Stenting restores the integrity of the vessel lumen immediately, efficiently prevents the occurrence or recurrence of ischemic events, and avoids the need of long-term anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
