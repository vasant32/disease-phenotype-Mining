<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ICAD may produce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> due to occlusion of the involved artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This occlusion may occur at or near the site of the dissection, or "downstream" as a result of embolization from a dislodged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The problem any chiropractic physician faces in identifying ICAD patients is that the condition may present without any symptoms or the symptoms may appear benign (e.g., <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, neck pain or cervicogenic dizziness) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consequently, it may be impossible to identify some ICAD patients, especially in the early stages of the pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As the ICAD progresses and neural blood flow is compromised, the symptom picture typically manifests more completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The chiropractic physician must be alert to characteristic findings of a progressing ICAD, since an immediate referral to a medical specialist may be required </plain></SENT>
