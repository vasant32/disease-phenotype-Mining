<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the potential role of cerebral revascularization in the treatment of patients with symptomatic occlusive cerebrovascular disease refractory to medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty patients with symptomatic occlusive cerebrovascular disease underwent 22 extracranial-intracranial bypass procedures after failing maximal medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The average follow-up time was 3.5 years, and no patient was lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presented with repeated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> refractory to medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiographic findings included internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in 8 patients, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> or occlusion in 4, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in 4, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> in 2, and supraclinoid internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcome was excellent in 17 patients and good in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The only surgical complication occurred in one patient, who experienced postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and required <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the Cooperative Study on Extracranial-Intracranial Bypass failed to show a benefit from the bypass procedure, we have continued to perform the operation in selected cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Carefully selected individuals with occlusive cerebrovascular disease and persistent ischemic symptoms, despite maximal medical therapy, seem to obtain demonstrable and durable benefit from cerebral revascularization </plain></SENT>
