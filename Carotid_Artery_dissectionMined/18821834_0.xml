<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most specific feature of the MNC is the extended length of 14 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurointervention involving the MNC was undertaken in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intervention procedures were transvenous embolization for a dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> in 4 patients, transarterial embolization for a dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> in 2, parent <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for a <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> in 4, and stent-assisted embolization for a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A push technique through microcatheter was used to deploy the MNCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The MNCs were successfully placed into the venous sinus lesion, feeding artery, parent artery of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, and the pseudoaneurysm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no major technical complications resulting in morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The postoperative course was uneventful except in 2 cases in which the occluded vessel recanalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Use of MNCs was safe and feasible for embolization of cerebrovascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fewer coils are required in embolization when using MNCs </plain></SENT>
