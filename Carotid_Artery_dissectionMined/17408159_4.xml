<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the outcome of 278 consecutive patients who received contrast-enhanced CT for blunt chest trauma with computerized searches of the regional trauma database, hospital medical records, universal government medical coverage plan billing records, and regional vital statistics databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data retrieved included patient demographics, mechanism of injury, status of the aorta and proximal great vessels at contrast-enhanced CT, hospital discharge diagnoses, and outpatient procedural billings with specific attention to aortic or great vessel injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 615 days following the traumatic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six subjects demonstrated direct signs of aortic or proximal great vessel injury on contrast-enhanced chest CT, as follows: aortic pseudoaneurysm and intimal flap (n = 4), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> (n = 1), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were surgically treated, except the patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, who was treated medically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the other subjects, contrast-enhanced CT was negative (n = 230) or showed isolated mediastinal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> (n = 42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The computerized searches of the medical databases showed that none of these 272 subjects had procedures for, or died from, aortic or great vessel injury during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Computerized searches of medical databases found no evidence of missed thoracic aortic or proximal great vessel injury in blunt trauma patients who were evaluated with contrast-enhanced chest CT </plain></SENT>
