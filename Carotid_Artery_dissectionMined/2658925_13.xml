<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis is conventionally established on the basis of characteristic clinical symptoms and arteriographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the presence of characteristic hemodynamic features detected by ultrasound may already suggest the diagnosis, even in atypical cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is demonstrated in 16 (76%) of 22 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An intense systolic low-frequency Doppler signal of alternating flow direction accessible in the neck, either along the extent of a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> tapering stenosis or proximal to a severe obstruction at the skullbase, indicated this diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Resolution or decreasing stenosis may similarly be diagnosed noninvasively, as shown by results from subsequent arteriograms in 14 patients (64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This occurred suddenly during sequential follow-up between 2 days and 30 weeks (mean, 6 weeks) after the diagnosis was made </plain></SENT>
