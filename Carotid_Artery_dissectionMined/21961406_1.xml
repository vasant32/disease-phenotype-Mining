<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissection</z:e> is a common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in young patients without vascular risk factors and may affect the carotid or vertebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The risk of spontaneous dissection is higher in those with genetic predisposing factors while other cases may be precipitated by an event involving head or neck movement or associated with direct neck trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: We present the case of a previously well young woman with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> following a turbulent short-haul commercial flight while restrained using a seatbelt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: We propose that repetitive flexion-hyperextension neck movements encountered during the flight were the most likely precipitant of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> in this case and review the therapeutic options available </plain></SENT>
