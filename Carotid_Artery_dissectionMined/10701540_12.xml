<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon is rare and has been described in only three previous instances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors present their management strategies in three additional cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three young women aged 24 to 43 years were victims of manual strangulation committed by their spouses 3 months to 1 year before presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two of the patients suffered delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> before presentation and angiography demonstrated focal, mirror-image severe residual stenoses in the high-cervical internal carotid artery (ICA), which were characteristic of a healed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection; there was no evidence of fibromuscular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of these patients underwent unilateral percutaneous angioplasty with stent placement, and the other underwent bilateral percutaneous angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both patients have recovered from their <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and remain clinically stable at 8 and 20 months posttreatment, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The third patient presented with bilateral ischemic frontal watershed infarctions resulting from an occluded left ICA and a severely narrowed right ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Given the extent of the established infarctions, this case was managed with a long-term regimen of anticoagulation medications, and the patient remains neurologically impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These cases illustrate the susceptibility of the manually compressed ICA to traumatic injury as a result of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206073" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">domestic violence</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They identify bilateral symmetrical ICA dissection as a consistent finding and the real danger of delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as a consequence of strangulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Endovascular therapy in which percutaneous angioplasty and/or stent placement are used can be useful in treating residual focal stenoses to improve cerebral perfusion and to lower the risk of embolic or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
