<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We aimed to explore clinical features of young patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> with no traditional vascular risk factors and to assess the impact of risk factor counts on outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included 990 patients aged 15 to 49 years with first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> followed for a mean of 9.0 Â± 3.8 years (survivors) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Risk factors were categorized as well-documented and less well-documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures were unfavorable functional outcome (3-month modified Rankin Scale 2-6); recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or other arterial noncerebrovascular event; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from any cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with those with at least 1 well-documented risk factor, the 127 (12.8%) patients without risk factors were younger (median age, 37 versus 44 years; P&lt;0.001), likely to be females (54.3% versus 34.9%; P&lt;0.001), and they had more frequently a low-risk source of cardioembolism (21.3% versus 8.1%; P&lt;0.001), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> (12.6% versus 6.4%; P=0.011), or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> (17.3% versus 7.2%; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The groups had similar 3-month functional outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients without well-documented risk factors had less frequently recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> (4.7% versus 13.6%; log rank P=0.014), noncerebrovascular arterial events (0% versus 6.1%; P=0.008), and lower long-term mortality (3.4% versus 14.3%; P=0.003) than did those with at least 1 risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adjusted for demographics and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> etiology, the number of well-documented risk factors was associated with higher risk for noncerebrovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increasing count of less well-documented risk factors was, in turn, independently associated with higher long-term mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In young adults with first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, risk factor counts added independent prognostic information regarding noncerebrovascular events and mortality </plain></SENT>
