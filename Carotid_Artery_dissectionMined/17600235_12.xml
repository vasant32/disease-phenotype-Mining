<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Tandem internal carotid and middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> independently predicts poor outcome after intravenous thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recanalization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> by stent-assisted angioplasty has recently been proposed when anticoagulation fails to prevent a new ischemic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recently reported a case of tandem internal carotid and middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with dissection of the internal carotid artery successfully treated with endovascular stent-assisted thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared clinical outcomes in consecutive patients presenting with tandem internal carotid and middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> within 3 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> who were eligible for intravenous thrombolysis, treated by either endovascular stent-assisted thrombolysis or intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rtPA) when an endovascular therapist was unavailable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale scores were obtained at baseline and after 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The modified Rankin Scale score was used to assess outcomes at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Arterial recanalization was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 10 patients screened, 6 were treated with endovascular therapy and 4 with intravenous rtPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Before treatment, mean National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale scores were high and comparable in the 2 groups (17 and 16, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the endovascular group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients achieved middle cerebral artery recanalization with subsequent dramatic improvement versus only 1 patient with middle cerebral artery recanalization in the intravenous rtPA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At 3 months, 4 patients in the endovascular group had a favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score=0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the intravenous rtPA group, 3 patients had a poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale score&gt; or =3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular stent-assisted thrombolysis is a promising treatment in tandem internal carotid and middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> and compares favorably with intravenous rtPA </plain></SENT>
