<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> was correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> etiology and the strength of antithrombotic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Concurrently, we wanted to demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients are solid in nature and not gaseous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients with middle cerebral artery ischemic events, 16 with completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 3 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) were investigated within 24 h following the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six 1-hour recordings on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 14 were performed from the affected middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The four-gate technique and recently established criteria for the identification of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight of 19 patients showed <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in at least one recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Variability was high and showed no uniform tendency with respect to time since <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms or treatment </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, no <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, ongoing, emerging and vanishing embolization in some patients may reflect individual active processes of remodelling, healing and disruption or disappearance of the embolic source </plain></SENT>
