<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report initial clinical experience with stent placement in the cerebrovascular circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four patients underwent arterial or venous stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two patients had cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissections</z:e>, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and stenoses of the distal cervical carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients had venous occlusive disease involving the major dural sinuses, with substantial pressure gradients across the stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immediately after stent placement, the true arterial lumina returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diameter and both carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were more than 90% occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up angiography demonstrated continued improvement in the arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both patients with dural sinus venous occlusive disease showed substantial improvement of the sinus stenoses and substantial reversal of the pressure gradients after venous stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, these patients have done well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This preliminary experience suggests there may be a role for stents in the management of arterial and venous cerebrovascular disease, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> and venous occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
