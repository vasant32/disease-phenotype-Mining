<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Blunt carotid artery injury resulting in either dissection or pseudoaneurysm is a rare entity that can result in significant morbidity and mortality if undiagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although unavoidable in certain traumatic situations such as motor vehicle collisions, direct neck trauma in sports may be preventable with the use of proper protective equipment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: The following report documents a case of extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> resulting from a foul ball striking the upper, lateral neck of an umpire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient had transient right upper extremity monoparesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He later presented with right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> that resolved over several hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Imaging studies demonstrated a left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751816" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid pseudoaneurysm</z:e> with evidence of left hemispheric embolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Systemic intravenous anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> followed by oral anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> for 6 months, subsequently followed by aspirin monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of standard protective equipment did not adequately cover the patient's neck in the region of the cervical carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This case illustrates that modification in current catcher and umpire equipment could potentially avoid this rare but significant vascular injury </plain></SENT>
