<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 48 patients aged 16 to 49 years with hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> treated with intravenous alteplase in Helsinki University Central Hospital from 1994 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For comparison of outcome, we selected, blinded to outcome data, 96 control subjects (1:2) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> not treated with alteplase matched by age, gender, and admission <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity (National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We selected similarly 96 older alteplase-treated gender and arrival National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score-matched patients (aged, 50 to 79 years) for comparison of outcome and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 3-month favorable outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> was defined according to the Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Monitor Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Young alteplase-treated patients (67% males; mean age, 38.8+/-9.1 years) more often recovered completely (27% versus 10%, P=0.010) and achieved a favorable outcome (40% versus 22%, P=0.025) compared with their age-matched control subjects not treated with alteplase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In alteplase-treated patients, unfavorable outcome was more frequent in males and in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We observed no difference in outcome between cases and older control subjects treated with alteplase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, none of the cases had symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> versus 3 (3%) in the older control group (P=0.551) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mortality rate was 2% (P=0.552) in age-matched control subjects and 7% (P=0.095) among older control subjects, whereas none of the case patients died during the 3-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Young adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> benefited from intravenous thrombolysis with good safety </plain></SENT>
