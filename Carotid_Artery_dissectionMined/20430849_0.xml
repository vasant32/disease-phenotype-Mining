<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of emergent self-expanding stent placement for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intracranial or extracranial ICAD with significant hemodynamic insufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight patients (7 men and 1 woman; age range, 20-55 years; NIHSS score, 5-21) underwent emergent self-expanding stent placement for treatment of significant hemodynamic insufficiency due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ICAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The safety and efficacy of emergent self-expanding stent placement were retrospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presented with progressive (n = 6) or fluctuating (n = 2) neurologic deficits and revealed markedly decreased perfusion on CT or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> perfusion studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conventional angiography revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusion (n = 2) or critical stenosis (n = 6) in intracranial (n = 3) or extracranial (n = 5) carotid arteries with a lack of sufficient collaterals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stent placement was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients without any procedure-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, hemodynamic insufficiency was corrected immediately after stent placement, and neurologic symptoms were completely resolved during several days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean improvement of the NIHSS score between baseline and discharge was 11.6 (range, 5-21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients remained neurologically intact (mRS, 0) during clinical follow-up for a mean of 21 months (range, 8-50 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Angiographic follow-up was available for 6 patients at 3-12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the 6 patients revealed residual or in-stent restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Self-expanding stent placement is a safe and effective option for selected patients with significant hemodynamic insufficiency due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intracranial or extracranial ICAD </plain></SENT>
