<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This article reviews our experience with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> (ICAD), evaluates the usefulness of Duplex scanning in diagnosis, provides current recommendations for treatment, and better defines long-term prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The records from 1976 to 1995 of 24 patients who had 28 ICAD were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> diagnoses were confirmed by arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Presenting symptoms, diagnostic tests, clinical management, and outcome were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine patients had visual symptoms or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, 10 had transient focal neurologic symptoms (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>), and five had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five of the 19 who had visual symptoms or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> before the diagnosis of ICAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients who had 19 ICAD underwent a Duplex scan at the time of presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Duplex scan identified 18 arterial abnormalities consistent with ICAD (sensitivity, 95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during the initial hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 21 who survived, 12 were treated with anticoagulation therapy, six with aspirin, and three with aspirin and anticoagulation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the 21 patients had a subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six patients subsequently had an operation for residual occlusive disease or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of follow-up was 9.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed contralateral ICAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 19 arteries were studied with Duplex scan, and seven had no residual evidence of ICAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients who have ICAD often have prodromal symptoms before <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>If diagnosed early, treatment with anticoagulation may prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Duplex scans are accurate for defining carotid abnormalities consistent with ICAD and for indicating the need for arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Patients should undergo a follow-up Duplex scan to identify contralateral ICAD </plain></SENT>
