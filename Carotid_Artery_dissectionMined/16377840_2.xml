<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was no obvious injury, but afterward she first developed unusual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> of unknown origin and then a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> 7 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further diagnostics, including magnetic resonance imaging techniques, revealed a dissection of the carotid artery to be the reason for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, probably caused by being hit by the cow's tail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This case demonstrates that persisting unusual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>, even after minor trauma, should lead to further diagnostic procedures and then therapeutic intervention for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention if necessary </plain></SENT>
