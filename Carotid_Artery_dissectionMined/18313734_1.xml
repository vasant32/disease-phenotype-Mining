<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although extracranial carotid dissection with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is common, intracranial dissection with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stenting has been used to treat extracranial carotid dissections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intracranially, however, it is only recently that stents have become a feasible option for this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present a case of a spontaneous intracranial CAD with progressive symptoms despite medical management treated with a self-expanding intracranial micronitinol stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: A 47-year-old, right-handed woman presented to the emergency department after noticing left-sided face and arm <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and numbness, along with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001350'>slurred speech</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient was started on aspirin 325 mg/d orally and lovenox 40 mg/d subcutaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On hospital day 2, the patient was noted to have repeated episodes of <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and numbness on the left side and MRI evidence of a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A diagnostic cerebral angiogram from a selective right internal carotid injection revealed a flow-limiting stenosis secondary to a dissection of the supraclinoid internal carotid artery with severe flow limitation to the hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Endovascular management was decided on, and a Neuroform stent measuring 4.5 x 20 mm (Boston Scientific Corporation, Natick, Mass) was deployed across the dissection with significant improvement of flow to that hemisphere on the poststent angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates the successful off-label use of a self-expanding intracranial nitinol stent to treat a symptomatic intracranial internal CAD in the setting of failure of traditional medical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is a promising application of novel endovascular technology </plain></SENT>
