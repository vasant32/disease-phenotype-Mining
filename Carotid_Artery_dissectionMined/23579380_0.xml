<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Carotid artery dissection</z:e> during CAS is a rare but potentially devastating complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the left internal carotid artery during filter tip wire engaging maneuvers, complicated by intraoperative complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> of the left eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immediate conversion to carotid endarterectomy was performed under general anesthesia with electroencephalographic monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient was discharged home symptomless and remains asymptomatic eight months after the operation, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> left internal carotid patency and fully recovered eyesight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> carotid occlusion during CAS requires emergent evaluation and definitive endovascular or open surgical repair to minimize neurologic morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We advocate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> endovascular procedures are carried out in a well-established surgical environment </plain></SENT>
