<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Extracranial and intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) dissections following sports-related activities have been reported as a result of blunt traumatic injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> in sports is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Failure of physicians to suspect a dissection in the context of a minor injury or to obtain a history from the patient can lead to permanent neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>REVIEW SUMMARY: The presentation of this entity is variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We present 2 cases of ICA dissection with differences in causative mechanism and management in order to emphasize the importance of a physician's awareness, and we review the literature on this subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pathogenesis of sports-related ICA dissections may be multifactorial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Structural aberrations in the arterial walls and defective connective tissue components are assumed in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several genes have been shown to be candidates for the connective tissue aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since sports-related ICA dissection can occur extracranially or intracranially, the combined use of proper diagnostic techniques that provides information on the extracranial and intracranial vessels is recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanisms and treatment modalities for intracranial and extracranial dissections might be different, the initial steps of evaluation and stabilization should be standardized for both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There is no randomized controlled study for the best treatment or management of ICA dissection </plain></SENT>
