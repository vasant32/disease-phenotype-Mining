<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Dissection of the internal carotid artery is a well-recognized complication of craniocervical trauma with potentially grave neurological outcome in patients with significant ischemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Traditional anticoagulation therapy may not be applicable, since anticoagulation is contraindicated in multiple trauma or penetrating injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these circumstances, rapid stenting followed by antiplatelet therapy may be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with angiographically proven traumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> were prospectively selected for endovascular stenting according to clinical and radiological criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Essentially, patients with hemodynamic significant hemispheric hypoperfusion (as indicated by angiography or perfusion MRI), or in whom <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy failed clinically, or anticoagulation was contraindicated, were considered at high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and were selected for stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients were selected for stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In seven patients, multiple stents were implanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endovascular treatment reduced mean dissection stenosis from mean 65+/-33% (range, 10-100%) to mean 7+/-9% (range, 20-0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a mean clinical follow-up of 11.5+/-6.3 months (range 3-24 months), eight patients improved and four remained stable, and none of the patients had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Doppler U/S studies did not detect any signs of de novo in-stent stenosis in any of the patients at a mean follow-up time of 9.2+/-6.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In selected cases of traumatic dissections of the carotid artery, endovascular stent-assisted angioplasty may immediately restore the integrity of the vessel lumen, even of acutely occluded arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This approach efficiently prevented the occurrence of new ischemic events, without additional anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
