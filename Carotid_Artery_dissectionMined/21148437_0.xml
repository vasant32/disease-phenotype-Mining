<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: the effectiveness of different treatments for internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection has not been well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lack of early prognostic indicators may represent a major problem in adequately identifying the most appropriate option for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed at evaluating the influence of patients' vascular risk profiles and of early cerebral hemodynamic changes in determining the clinical evolution after ICA dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: sixty-six <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with ICA occlusion due to spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissection</z:e> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler was performed within 24 hours from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to examine cerebral arteries and the patency of the 3 major intracranial collateral vessels (ophthalmic artery and anterior and posterior communicating arteries) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Possible recanalization of the occluded ICA within the first month was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> severity at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was assessed with the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale, whereas outcome was defined according to the modified Rankin Scale score at 90 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: forty patients had at least 2 activated intracranial collateral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remaining 26 patients, with none or only 1 collateral vessel, showed a significant increased risk of poor recovery (modified Rankin Scale score â‰¥ 2; adjusted relative risk=14.9; 95% CI, 3.24 to 68.46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Poor recovery was not associated with the occurrence of recanalization, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, or with vascular risk profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: early assessment of cerebral hemodynamic status and, in particular, the activation of intracranial collateral vessels, may help in predicting the outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with ICA lumen occlusion as a result of spontaneous dissection </plain></SENT>
