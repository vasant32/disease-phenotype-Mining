<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 19 patients (20 lesions) who underwent carotid endarterectomy, 18 had not undergone preoperative angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High-grade lesions (&gt; 75%-diameter stenosis) were surgically confirmed in 16; a 60%-70% stenosis, in one; and subtotal occlusion of the internal carotid artery, in another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed in a case of suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the five nonsurgical cases, no significant stenosis was noted with both techniques in two instances, total occlusion was seen in two cases, and an asymptomatic stenosis was seen in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up (average, 4.5 months) showed one case of symptomatic occlusion of the internal carotid artery after endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This preliminary study suggests that the combined use of Doppler sonography and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography can, in up to 79% (15 of 19) of cases, replace angiography for the preoperative evaluation of patients likely to need carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
