<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the delayed outcomes and graft patency rates of patients who underwent bypass procedures for symptomatic traumatic ICA dissection were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between September 1989 and August 1996, 13 patients (9 male and 4 female patients; mean age, 30.6 yr) underwent 16 revascularization procedures for symptomatic traumatic ICA dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The duration of clinical follow-up averaged 47.3 months (range, 12-94 mo) from the date of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The duration of radiographic follow-up (catheter or magnetic resonance angiography, duplex Doppler ultrasonography) averaged 24 months (range, 12-60 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ICA dissection was caused by blunt (n = 11) or penetrating trauma (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Associated angiographic abnormalities included seven ipsilateral ICA occlusions, six dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, two carotid-cavernous fistulae, and six contralateral traumatic ICA dissections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients requiring early revascularization (n = 6) underwent bypass procedures an average of 19.2 days after their injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Medically managed patients who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> later were revascularized a mean of 7.8 months after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score at the time of presentation was 10 (range, scores of 6-15), and the mean Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score before revascularization was 14 (range, scores of 9-15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were 14 saphenous vein ICA bypasses (8 cervical-to-petrous, 3 cervical-to-middle cerebral artery, 3 petrous-to-supraclinoid) and 2 superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery bypasses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was one early postoperative graft occlusion, which responded to surgical thrombectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient with multiple other traumatic injuries died as a result of a pulmonary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> 12 months after revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> remaining patients had Glasgow Outcome Scale scores of 5, with patent bypass grafts confirmed during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Revascularization for persistently symptomatic traumatic ICA dissection eliminated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and was associated with excellent long-term outcomes and graft patency rates </plain></SENT>
