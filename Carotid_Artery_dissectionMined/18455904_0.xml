<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Internal carotid dissection can be responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and lead to severe neurological and functional complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, it must be diagnosed and treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> as soon as possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner syndrome</z:hpo> is one of the most usual manifestations of internal carotid dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a patient who presented with a unilateral non-reactive enlargement of the right pupil that did not last longer than 30 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a carotid dissection was not recognized from this atypical symptomatology, magnetic resonance angiography was performed only a few days later when <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner syndrome</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It disclosed a dissection of the internal carotid artery ipsilateral from its origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The evolution and the duration of the pupil involvement suggest that the initial episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011499'>mydriasis</z:hpo> was caused by an oculosympathetic spasm, a rare form of sympathetic dysfunction that can be observed when the sympathetic nerve or the pericarotid plexus is irritated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is important to recognize this oculosympathetic spasm because it has equal value as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner syndrome</z:hpo> for the diagnosis of internal carotid dissection </plain></SENT>
