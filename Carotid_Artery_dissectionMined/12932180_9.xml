<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 68-year-old man presented to an outside hospital with complaints of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, severe left-sided neck pain, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, chills, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a large (3.5x3 cm) extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the left ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient was emergently transferred to our facility for endovascular treatment of the carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Via a percutaneous access in the right common femoral artery, 2 Jostent coronary stent-grafts were deployed across the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with no evidence of a residual pseudoaneurysm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient was hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Duplex examination at 9 months revealed no evidence of a residual pseudoaneurysm, dissection, or endoleak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Covered coronary stents may have a role in the treatment of spontaneous ICA dissection with pseudoaneurysm formation </plain></SENT>
