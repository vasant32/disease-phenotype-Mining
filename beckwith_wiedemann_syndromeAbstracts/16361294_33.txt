BACKGROUND: Recent reports have suggested a higher risk of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) after assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs), but it is unclear whether this might also apply to other disorders of genomic imprinting. METHODS: We contacted families of children with BWS, AS, Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM) to determine use of ART. RESULTS: A statistically significant increased frequency of ART in children with BWS was confirmed [2.9%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4-6.3% vs 0.8% expected] but there was no significant association with PWS or TNDM. Consideration of the molecular subgroup of BWS and AS suggested the feasibility of association with ART. CONCLUSIONS: These differences may relate to variations in (i) the molecular mechanisms for disordered imprinting in the different disorders and (ii) the susceptibility of specific imprinting control regions to ART-associated methylation alterations (epimutations).
