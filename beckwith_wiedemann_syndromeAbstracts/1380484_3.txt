Constitutional and somatic chromosomal abnormalities of the chromosome 11p15 region are involved in an overgrowth malformation syndrome, the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), and in several types of associated tumors. The bias in parental origin for the different etiologic forms of this syndrome and for loss of heterozygosity in the tumors suggests that a gene (or genes) mapping to this region undergoes genomic imprinting. However, the precise localization of the locus (or loci) for the BWS and associated tumors is still unknown and more markers are required. We therefore isolated 11p15 markers from two libraries: the first one obtained by microdissection of the chromosome 11p15.5 region and the second one, a phage library, constructed from a hybrid cell line containing this region as its sole human DNA. Of 19 microclones isolated from the microdissection library, 11 were evolutionarily conserved. Four phage clones were isolated; one (D11S774) detected a highly informative variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) and another (D11S773) a biallelic polymorphism. These clones were sublocalized using a panel of somatic cell hybrids that defines eight physical intervals in 11p15.5. Twenty-one clones map to the distal interval that harbors the BWS locus.
