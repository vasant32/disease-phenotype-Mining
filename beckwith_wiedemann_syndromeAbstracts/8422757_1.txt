Specific tumor-associated rearrangements involving the regions 11p13 and 11p15 have been extensively documented. However, cytogenetic definition of the breakpoints occurring at the boundaries of these two regions was not precise enough to correlate with the molecular data. Using probes corresponding to the genes coding for MYOD1, CTSD, LDHA, and RBTN1 and to the anonymous sequence D11S776, we have reassessed the breakpoints of three hybrids (J1.10, BID7, and NYX3.1) and confirmed the localization or more precisely mapped these four genes and the anonymous DNA marker on different subregions of 11pter-->p13, including the smallest region of 11p15.5 duplicated in a patient with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.
