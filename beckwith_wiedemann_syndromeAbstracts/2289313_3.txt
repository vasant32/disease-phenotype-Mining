We report here two siblings diagnosed as having Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. In addition to Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, one of the siblings was also diagnosed with prune belly syndrome. The other sibling suffered from obstructive uropathy and unilateral cryptorchidism, which are also seen in prune belly syndrome. We believe that these two cases point to a potential association between Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, prune belly syndrome, and urinary tract anomaly.
