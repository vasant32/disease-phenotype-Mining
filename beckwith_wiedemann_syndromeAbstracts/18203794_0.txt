Medullary sponge kidney (MSK) is a congenital anomaly characterized by dilatation of the collecting ducts of Bellini associated with defective urinary acidification and concentration. Medullary nephrocalcinosis/ nephrolithiasis is the usual presentation in adults, however neonatal and childhood cases are being reported with increasing frequency. Among the conditions associated with MSK are Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome/hemihyperplasia (13%), horseshoe kidney, congenital small kidney, hyperparathyroidism, Caroli syndrome, congenital hepatic fibrosis, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, immotile cilia syndrome, and arterial fibromuscular dysplasia. This article describes an adult female who underwent nephrectomy for renovascular hypertension due to multivessel fibromuscular dysplasia with small left kidney found to be associated with MSK.
