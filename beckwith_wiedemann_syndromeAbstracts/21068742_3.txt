This report describes androgenetic/biparental mosaicism in a 4-year-old Japanese girl with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS)-like and paternal uniparental disomy 14 (upd(14)pat)-like phenotypes. We performed methylation analysis for 18 differentially methylated regions on various chromosomes, genome-wide microsatellite analysis for a total of 90 loci and expression analysis of SNRPN in leukocytes. Consequently, she was found to have an androgenetic 46,XX cell lineage and a normal 46,XX cell lineage, with the frequency of the androgenetic cells being roughly calculated as 91% in leukocytes, 70% in tongue tissues and 79% in tonsil tissues. It is likely that, after a normal fertilization between an ovum and a sperm, the paternally derived pronucleus alone, but not the maternally derived pronucleus, underwent a mitotic division, resulting both in the generation of the androgenetic cell lineage by endoreplication of one blastomere containing a paternally derived pronucleus and in the formation of the normal cell lineage by union of paternally and maternally derived pronuclei. It appears that the extent of overall (epi)genetic aberrations exceeded the threshold level for the development of BWS-like and upd(14)pat-like phenotypes, but not for the occurrence of other imprinting disorders or recessive Mendelian disorders.
