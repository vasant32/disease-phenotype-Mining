Chromosome band 11p15.5 has proven to be an intriguing area of the human genome. Various studies have linked alterations in this region to growth-related disorders such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and a variety of human cancers. Furthermore, functional assays in G401 Wilms tumor cells and RD rhabdomyosarcoma cells support the existence of a tumor suppressor gene on 11p15.5, sometimes called WT2. In addition, several genes mapping to this region show imprinted expression, suggesting that 11p15.5 contains an imprinted domain. We have employed solution hybrid capture in combination with sequence analysis to identify 16 genes within the approximately 700-kb critical region of 11p15.5 between D11S601 and D11S1318. Two of these genes, NAP1L4 and KCNA9, had been previously reported. Ten novel transcripts were identified with partial cDNA sequences selected by solution hybrid capture. Sequence homology to known ESTs was used to identify the remaining gene transcripts. Interestingly, the tissue-specific mRNA expression of these genes correlates with the tumor types linked to this region. This work can be compiled into a transcript map, important in the elucidation of tumor suppressor activity on chromosome 11p15.5.
