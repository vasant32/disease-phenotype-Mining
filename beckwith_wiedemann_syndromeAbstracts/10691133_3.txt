We have constructed approximately 1-Mb contigs of yeast artificial chromosome (YAC), bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and cosmid clones covering the imprinted region in mouse chromosome band 7F4/F5. This region is syntenic to human chromosome 11p15.5, which is associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and certain childhood and adult tumors. These contigs provide the basis for genomic sequencing, identification of genes and their regulatory elements, and functional studies in transgenic and knockout mice, which should be of help to understand not only the mechanisms of imprinting but also the molecular events involved in the genesis of BWS and tumors.
