Three genes on 11p15.5 are known to undergo genomic imprinting. The gene for insulin-like growth factor II (IGF2) is normally expressed from the paternal allele, while H19 and p57KIP2, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, are expressed from the maternal allele. Five germline balanced chromosomal rearrangement breakpoints from patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) have been mapped to 11p15.5 between p57KIP2 and IGF2, and all are derived from the maternal chromosome. By positional cloning from BWS breakpoints, we have isolated a gene 100 kb and 65 kb centromeric to the proximal end of this BWS breakpoint cluster and p57KIP2, respectively. This gene is homologous to yeast nucleosome assembly protein (NAP1) and to a human homologue of NAP1, and we designate it hNAP2 (human nucleosome assembly protein 2). hNAP2 diverges in its expression pattern from IGF2, H19, and p57KIP2, and it shows biallelic expression in all tissues tested. Thus, hNAP2 is functionally insulated from the imprinting domain of 11p15.
