Twenty-four cases of Wilms' tumor were analyzed. The gray-scale echographic characteristics of the tumors were categorized. Correlation with pathologic characteristics, clinical presentation, prognosis, and therapy response was assessed. Two echographic patterns emerged: (a) hypoechoic solid--3; and (b) hyperechoic solid--21. Necrotic degeneration as well as decrease in tumor size were echographic features correlated with positive response to therapy. The results of this analysis showed no initial correlation between the echographic patterns and the clinical presentation or prognosis. On the other hand, the echographic features of Wilms' tumor seem distinctive enough to help in etiologic differentiation and therapy management.
