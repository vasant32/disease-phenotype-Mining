OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of imprinted genes related to Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) in human oocytes and preimplantation embryos for understanding the relationship between assisted reproductive technology (ART) and BWS. METHODS: Using nested reverse transcription-PCR to analyze the expression of P57KIP2, LIT1, TSSC3 in human oocytes and preimplantation embryos. RESULTS: Transcripts of P57KIP2 were detected in human oocytes and at all stages of preimplantation embryos. LIT1 was expressed only in stages of 8-cell and blastocyst. Transcripts of TSSC3 could not be detected in human oocytes and preimplantation embryos. CONCLUSION: Transcripts of P57KIP2 and LIT1, imprinted genes related to BWS, were detected in human preimplantation development; ART might affect the epigenetics of imprinted genes in early embryogenesis.
