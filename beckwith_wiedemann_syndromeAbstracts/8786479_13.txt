Of 16 infants with infantile hepatic hemangioendothelioma, 14 (88%) presented before age 3 months. For seven cases (44%), the diagnosis was suspected from antenatal ultrasonographic findings. Two (13%) presented with asymptomatic hepatomegaly. The most common presenting features were high-output cardiac failure in 11 (69%), consumptive coagulopathy in 12 (75%), and anemia in 12(75%). Sixty-three percent of the children had associated cutaneous hemangiomata, and disseminated hemangiomatosis was noted in two (13%). Medical measures were effective in stabilizing seven (44%) cases with high-output congestive cardiac failure and/or consumptive coagulopathy. Partial right hepatectomy was successful for four patients; the only death occurred in a newborn, after intraperitoneal rupture of the hepatic hemangioma. Embolization was used in two children to induce involution. Spontaneous involution occurred in two patients. Initially, hepatic hemangiomas should be treated conservatively, with surgery reserved for intractable cardiac failure and/or refractory consumptive coagulopathy.
