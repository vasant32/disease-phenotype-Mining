Patients with the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have numerous anomalies, varying somewhat from case to case. The most common presentation is exomphalos, macroglossia, and somatic gigantism. Although cleft palate in association with this syndrome has been rarely reported, we have observed 6 patients with cleft palate in 10 patients who were diagnosed with the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. The literature is reviewed and discussed.
