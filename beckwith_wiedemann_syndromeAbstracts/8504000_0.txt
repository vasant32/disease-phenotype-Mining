Ultrasound is the best non-invasive study to evaluate renal morphology in the neonate; so we decided to undergo a study looking for normal renal size in relation with other anthropometric measures. We performed renal ultrasounds in 50 healthy, appropriate for gestational age, term-babies. We found correlation between several anthropometric measures, but the most significant were weight and height. In most cases the left similar to others. It is important to know normal renal dimensions in newborns, since there are diseases that not only are associated with an increased incidence of renal malformations, but also with a reduced renal size such as Down syndrome, or increased renal size such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.
