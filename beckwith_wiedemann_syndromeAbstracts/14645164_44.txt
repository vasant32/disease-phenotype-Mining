Recently, a series of case reports and small studies has suggested that births involving assisted reproductive technology (ART) may have an increased risk of imprinting disorders such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Angelman syndrome. Herein, the significance and implications of these findings are discussed. It is speculated that, although such imprinting disorders may be shown to be only rare complications of ART, epigenetic errors might account for a much wider spectrum of ART-related complications than is recognized currently. Addressing these questions should be a priority for research on cohorts of ART children.
