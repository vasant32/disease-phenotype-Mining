Insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) is a mitogen for many cell types and an important modulator of muscle growth and differentiation. IGF-II gene is prevalently expressed during prenatal development and its gene activity is regulated by genomic imprinting, in that the allele inherited from the father is active and the allele inherited from the mother is inactive in most normal tissues. IGF-II expression is activated in several types of human neoplasms and an alteration of IGF-II imprinting has been described in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Wilms' tumor. Here we show that monoallelic expression of IGF-II gene is conserved in normal adult muscle tissue whereas two or more copies of active IGF-II alleles, arising by either relaxation of imprinting or duplication of the active allele, are found in 9 out of 11 (82%) rhabdomyosarcomas retaining heterozygosity at 11p15, regardless of the histological subtype. Since IGF-II has been indicated as an autocrine growth factor for rhabdomyosarcoma cells, these findings strongly suggest that acquisition of a double dosage of active IGF-II gene is an important step for the initiation or progression of rhabdomyosarcoma tumorigenesis. Among different types of muscle tumors, relaxation of imprinting seems to arise prevalently in rhabdomyosarcomas, since we have detected only one case of partial reactivation of the maternal IGF-II allele out of 7 leiomyosarcomas tested.
