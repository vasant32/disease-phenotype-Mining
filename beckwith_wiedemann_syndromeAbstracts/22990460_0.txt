The last three decades have witnessed a dramatic increase in the use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) so that now, in developed countries, 1.7% to 4.0% of all children are born after ART. Although absolute risks appear small, data from prospective and retrospective studies indicate increased risks of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes after ART as compared with spontaneous conception. Recent studies suggest that underlying maternal factors and subfertility play an important role in some of these outcomes rather than the ART procedure itself. A significant risk of assisted conception is multiple pregnancies, but even singleton pregnancies achieved by ART are at a higher risk of hypertensive disease, diabetes, prematurity, low birth weight, and perinatal mortality even after adjusting for confounders. Couples undergoing ART procedures should be counseled in advance regarding increased risks of pregnancy complications and higher rates of obstetric interventions. Although conflicting data exist, studies of children born from ART suggest increased rates of congenital malformations, imprinting disorders (Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Angelman syndrome), and marginally increased risk of cancer. However, the current evidence is inadequate, and prospective long-term studies are needed to eliminate the effect of confounders and draw definite conclusions about the long-term outcomes after ART. The absolute risk of imprinting disorders remains small, and routine screening is not recommended at present. The long-term outcomes after ART are difficult to evaluate because of the variability in ART methods and data reporting, and there is a need for standardized methodology for follow-up after ART.
