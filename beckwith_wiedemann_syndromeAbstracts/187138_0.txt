A nephroblastoma occurred in the evolution of a case of Beckwith's syndrome. This rare association is not fortuitous. The bifocal character of the tumor is noted for the first time in the Beckwith's syndrome; however, it has already been observed in other conditions, which are known to promote the development of nephroblastomas. Wilm's tumor is only one of the tumors which may be associated with Beckwith's syndrome. These morbid associations and certain histological features bring together some material for the understanding of the nature of the histo-genetic relationship between different aspects of constitutional pathology and tumors.
