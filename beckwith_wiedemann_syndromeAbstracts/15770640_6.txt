High dose acetaminophen (HDAC) with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been effective in adults with advanced malignancies. We report HDAC with NAC in a child with progressive hepatoblastoma, confirmed at biopsy of an unresectable hepatic mass. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) increased despite four courses of doxorubicin and one course of cisplatin, 5-flurouracil, and vincristine. Following HDAC with NAC, AFP markedly decreased. A continued response without toxicity was observed during four subsequent courses of HDAC with NAC and cisplatin. The residual necrotic tumor was resected. The child is now over 8 years disease free. HDAC and NAC are effective and well tolerated for progressive hepatoblastoma.
