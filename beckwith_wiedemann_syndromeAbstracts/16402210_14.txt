Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM) is characterised by intra-uterine growth retardation, while Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a clinically heterogeneous overgrowth syndrome. Both TNDM and BWS may be caused by aberrant loss of methylation (LOM) at imprinted loci on chromosomes 6q24 and 11p15.5 respectively. Here we describe two patients with a clinical diagnosis of TNDM caused by LOM at the maternally methylated imprinted domain on 6q24; in addition, these patients had LOM at the centromeric differentially methylated region of 11p15.5. This shows that imprinting anomalies can affect more than one imprinted locus and may alter the clinical presentation of imprinted disease.
