The locus for the human parathyroid hormone gene (PTH) was assigned to a region proximal to 11p15.4 using restriction fragment length polymorphisms and gene dose studies performed on a patient with the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome accompanied with a chromosome abnormality [46,XX,-14,+der(14),t(14;11)(q32.3;p15.3)pat]. Our data suggest that PTH is localized in 11p15.3----p15.1, most likely near the border of the bands 11p15.4 and 11p15.3.
