Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) comprises of a number of childhood abnormalities, often associated with one or more tumors. Thirty-eight patients were investigated to determine clinical and/or biological signs associated with a tumor presence. Our patients exhibited a higher incidence of tumor development (21%) than that previously reported, underlying the care with which such patients should be followed, when particular clinical features are observed: visceromegaly affecting three organs (liver, kidney, spleen), and also family history with sign of BWS such as macroglossia, omphalocele, hemihypertrophy, embryonic tumor), high body weight at birth (> or = +2 standard deviations and diastasis recti.
