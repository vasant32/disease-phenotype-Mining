Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) have an increased risk of developing Wilms' tumors, hepatoblastomas, and adrenal tumors. This study evaluates disease-free survival in children with BWS and intraabdominal tumors. Sixteen tumors occurred in 13 children with BWS (8 boys, 5 girls). Diagnoses included Wilms' tumor (10) (2 bilateral, 20%), hepatoblastoma (2), bladder rhabdomyosarcoma (1), and adrenal cortical tumor (1). In the 10 children with Wilms' tumor, the average age at diagnosis was 3.5 years (range, 7 months to 5 years). Nine of 10 had initial tumor resection, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy (when indicated). One child with bilateral disease had tumor biopsy, chemotherapy, and partial nephrectomy. Tumors were classified as stage I (5), stage II (2), stage IV (1) and stage V (2), all with favorable histology. Disease-free survival rate was 100% with median follow-up of 9 years (range, 4 to 22 years). One patient had a left adrenal tumor detected during screening sonography 11 years after Wilms' tumor resection. Two infants with advanced-stage hepatoblastoma responded to chemotherapy, allowing subsequent complete hepatic resection. Both tumors had unfavorable histology. Both completed postoperative chemotherapy and have no evidence of disease (NED) with normal alpha-fetoprotein levels at 21 and 12 months, respectively, after tumor detection. One patient with stage III (group 3) bladder rhabdomyosarcoma underwent partial cystectomy following chemoradiation and is alive (NED) after 20 months. Children with BWS should be screened at regular intervals (every 3 to 6 months) for renal, adrenal, and hepatic tumors. The exact duration of screening is not yet determined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
