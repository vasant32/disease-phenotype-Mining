Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is an overgrowth condition with tumor proclivity linked to a genetic imbalance of a complex imprinted region in 11p15.5. A female child with features fitting in with the BWS diagnostic framework and an apparent loss of imprinting (LOI) of the IGF2 gene in 11p15.5 was also reported to have a de novo chromosome 18q segmental deletion (Patient 1), thus pointing at the location of a possible trans-activating regulator element for maintenance of IGF2 imprinting and providing one of the few examples of locus heterogeneity of BWS. A second child with de novo 18q23 deletion and features of macroglossia, naevus flammeus, bilateral inguinal hernia and transient neonatal hypoglycemia, thus also fitting in with the BWS diagnostic framework, is here fully reported (Patient 2). In this child, an analysis of the BWS1 locus precluded any paternal isodisomy and showed a normal imprinting pattern (mono-allelic expression of IGF2 and normal H19 and CDKN1OT1/LIT1 methylation index). In Patients 1 and 2, deletions were shown to overlap, defining a minimal region of haplo-insufficiency of 3.8-5.6 Mb in 18q23. We conclude that this region provides a candidate location for an original macroglossia condition with strong overlap with BWS, but without obvious upstream functional relationship with the BWS1 locus in 11p15.5. Because this minimal region of haplo-insufficiency falls into a common region of deletion in 18q- syndrome, we inferred that this macroglossia condition would follow a recessive pattern of inheritance.
