We report on an infant who had been prenatally diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome associated with a "de novo" pericentric inversion of the Y chromosome. A re-evaluation at 3 years of age suggested that he was also affected by Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). Karyotype was repeated and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis revealed trisomy for 11p15.5-->11pter and a distal monosomy 18q (18q23-->qter). Parental cytogenetic studies showed that the father carried a balanced cryptic translocation between chromosomes 11p and 18q. Furthermore, the child had an extra X chromosome and a "de novo" structural abnormality of chromosome Y. Thus, his karyotype was 47,XX, inv (Y) (p11.2 q11.23), der(18) t (11;18) (p15.5;q23) pat. ish der(18) (D11S2071+, D18S1390-). Two markers on the X chromosome showed that the extra X of the child was paternally inherited. No deletions were observed on the structurally abnormal Y chromosome from any of the microsatellites studied. Clinical findings of patients with BWS due to partial trisomy 11p reveal that there is a distinct pattern of dysmorphic features associated with an increased incidence of mental retardation when comparing patients with normal chromosomes. This fact reinforces that FISH study have to be performed in all BWS patients, specially in those with mental retardation since small rearrangements cannot be detected by conventional cytogenetic techniques.
