The development of Wilms' tumor has been associated with two genetic loci on chromosome 11: WT1 in 11p13 and WT2 in 11p15.5. Here, we have used loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in Wilms' tumors to narrow the WT2 locus distal to the D11S988 locus. A similar region was apparent for the clinically associated tumor, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. We have also demonstrated that a constitutional chromosome translocation breakpoint associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and an acquired somatic chromosome translocation breakpoint in a rhabdoid tumor each occur in the same chromosomal interval as the smallest region of LOH in Wilms' tumors and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. Finally, we report the first Wilms' tumor without a cytogenetic deletion that shows targeted LOH for 11p15 and 11p13 while maintaining germline status for 11p14.
