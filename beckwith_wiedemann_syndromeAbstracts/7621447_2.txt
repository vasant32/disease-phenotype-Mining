Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a rare condition (1/13,700 live births) occurring in both inherited and sporadic forms in the population. It is manifest as a fetal overgrowth syndrome, in which hypertrophy dominates the clinical picture. An additional complication is that these children are predisposed to a specific subset of childhood neoplasms, amongst which are Wilms' tumour and adrenocortical carcinoma. We report here the synthesis by an associated adrenal tumour of large quantities of a high molecular weight form of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II), associated with profound suppression of circulating IGFs in the patient's serum. As with other tumours of this type, the tumours showed loss of material on chromosome 11p.
