Using a panel of 25 somatic cell hybrids, we have regionally localized 112 microsatellite markers generated by Généthon and assigned to chromosome 11. A genetic map of 74 of them was produced using linkage analysis of the eight largest CEPH (Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain) families. They could be ordered on chromosome 11 with an average distance of 2.1 cM. The tight correlation observed between the genetic order and the physical assignment of these microsatellites reinforces the genetic map data. These newly localized markers identified by the PCR method using a standardized protocol represent useful tools for mapping YAC clones and establishing YAC contigs and for studying genetic diseases or cancers associated with specific genes and/or germinal/somatic rearrangements of chromosome 11.
