A premature infant with duplication of material from chromosome 11 and some features of the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome developed the bronze baby syndrome when exposed to phototherapy. He subsequently developed hepatocellular dysfunction and died aged 5 weeks. Post mortem examination revealed striking hypoplasia of intralobular bile ducts but little inflammatory change or necrosis in the liver.
