We conducted a retrospective study that compared serial alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) concentrations obtained from 22 children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) with levels established for healthy children. The AFP concentration is greater in patients with BWS and declines during the postnatal period at a significantly slower rate than what is reported in healthy children. AFP levels obtained in the course of routine tumor screening in children with BWS should be interpreted with a normal curve established specifically for BWS rather than with previously published data for healthy infants and children.
