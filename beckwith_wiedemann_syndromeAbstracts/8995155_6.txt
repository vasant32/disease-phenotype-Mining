We report a case of bilateral multilocular cystic adrenal masses in a neonate who demonstrated somatic hypertrophy and macroglossia, which are considered to constitute an incomplete form of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). After surgical removal of the masses, histological study revealed benign hemorrhagic macrocysts with cortical cytomegaly. There was no evidence of tumor or adrenal apoplexia. Although very rare, association of unilateral hemorrhagic adrenal macrocysts with BWS has been reported before; this is the first case of bilateral benign adrenal macrocysts associated with BWS.
