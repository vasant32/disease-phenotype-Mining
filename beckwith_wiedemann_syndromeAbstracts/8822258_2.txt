Eighteen infantile cases with bilateral vocal cord paralysis were treated at our hospital from 1970 to 1993. All cases were diagnosed using a flexible fiberscope to examine the larynx. Direct laryngoscopy was performed under general anesthesia for the definite diagnosis and differential diagnosis from laryngomalacia, subglottic stenosis, tracheal stenosis, or laryngeal web. Bilateral vocal cord paralysis in children is a rare disease, there have been few and reported cases. Eight cases were male and 10 cases were female. Thirteen cases were congenital, 4 cases acquired and 1 case was unknown. The characteristic symptoms of bilateral vocal cord paralysis include normal or near normal phonation with inspiratory stridor which may progress to complete respiratory obstruction. Associated anomalies and diseases included 3 cases of immature infant, 2 of myelomeningocele, and single cases of Arnold-Chiari malformation, cerebral palsy, hydrocephalus, laryngomalacia, William's syndrome, Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome, hypoxia, esophageal hiatus hernia, gastroesophageal reflex, spina bifida, COFS syndrome, and cerebral atrophy. Laryngeal function was completely recovered in seven cases following growth of the children incompletely recovered in five cases, and 2 cases retained right vocal cord paralysis. Tracheostomy was performed in 2 cases. One case died from the original disease, and the other one case was unknown. Swallowing function, phonation and development were good. Our experience suggests that the airway with bilateral vocal cord paralysis in children can be managed well without the need for tracheostomy.
