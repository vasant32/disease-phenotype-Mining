We report on a patient with Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (WBS) who developed abdominal neuroblastoma. Although WBS patients are known to have a higher incidence of embryonal tumors, this is only the 4th known case of neuroblastoma associated with this syndrome. Chromosomes on peripheral lymphocytes and tumor cells were normal. Children with WBS should be screened for a variety of embryonal neoplasms, not only Wilms tumor.
