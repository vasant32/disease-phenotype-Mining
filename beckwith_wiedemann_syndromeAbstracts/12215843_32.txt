Paternal duplications of distal 11p result in Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), whereas maternal duplications have not, to our knowledge, been reported previously in the literature. We present three unrelated patients with maternal duplications of distal 11p. Patient 1 is a 31-year-old female with a de novo inverted duplication of distal 11p, i.e. inv dup del(11)(qter-->p15.5::p15.5-->15.3); this rearrangement was shown to be maternal in origin by microsatellite analysis and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Patient 2 is a 4-year-old female with a derived chromosome 20, which arose from adjacent 1 malsegregation of a maternal t(11;20)(p15.3;q13.33). Patient 3 presented as an intrauterine death with trisomy for the majority of chromosome 11p as a result of 3:1 segregation of a maternal t(11;15)(p11.2;q11.2). In view of the imprinted status of this region, it is pertinent that none of our patients showed features of BWS; indeed, all had growth retardation, in contrast to the overgrowth characteristic of BWS. It is of note that, of the living patients, Patient 1 went into early puberty at 9.5 years and Patient 2 showed breast development in infancy. Both patients shared some dysmorphological features, namely short palpebral fissures, a prominent nasal tip, a short philtrum and 5th finger clinodactyly.
