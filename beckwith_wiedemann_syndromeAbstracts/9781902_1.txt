Vignettes of several stages in the evolution of present concepts of overgrowth and related syndromes are presented. The scientific study of this topic did not begin until the 18th century because of its delayed emergence from superstition and fallacy. Examples of early superstitions concerning gigantism are presented, with some historical comments on infant giants. The pioneering contributions of Isodore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire to the scientific analysis of overgrowth are emphasized. Details concerning the early history of the growth syndrome associated with the names of Wiedemann and Beckwith is presented, with emphasis on cases reported prior to ours.
