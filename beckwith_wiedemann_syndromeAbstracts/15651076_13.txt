We performed LIT1 and H19 methylation studies on 27 children with isolated hemihyperplasia (IH). Eight children (29.6%) had a defect in methylation of one or both of these alleles, supporting our hypothesis that these epigenetic changes can result in a phenotype distinct from typical Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.
