Genetic alterations of chromosome region 11p15 have been detected in neoplastic diseases as well as in cancer-predisposing syndromes. The cloning of the entire chromosomal region will be important for the identification and characterization of critical tumor suppressor genes. We have developed a yeast artificial chromosome contig that covers up to 7 Mb of this chromosome band. The most centromeric marker included in the contig is D11S932 and the most telomeric is D11S470. We have developed 18 new STS markers, which have been located in the contig in relation to 16 known markers. One of the yeast artificial chromosome clones was found to span the chromosome 11 breakpoint of the translocation t(11;18), associated with a case of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Cloning the regions in proximity to this translocation might reveal the presence of a gene altered in association with the development of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.
