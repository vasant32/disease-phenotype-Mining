Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is an overgrowth disorder resulting from dysregulation of multiple imprinted genes through a variety of distinct mechanisms. A frequent alteration in BWS involves changes in the imprinting status of the coordinately regulated IGF2 and H19 genes on 11p15. Patients have been categorized according to alterations in the imprinted expression, allele-specific methylation, and regional replication timing of these genes. In this work, IGF2/H19 expression, H19 DNA methylation, and IGF2 regional replication timing were studied in nine karyotypically normal BWS fibroblasts and two BWS patients with maternally inherited 11p15 chromosomal rearrangements. Informative patients (9/9) maintained normal monoallelic H19 expression/methylation, despite biallelic IGF2 expression in 6/9. Replication timing studies revealed no changes in the pattern of asynchronous replication timing for both a patient with biallelic IGF2 expression and a patient carrying an 11p15 inversion. In contrast, a patient with a chromosome 11;22 translocation and normal H19 expression/methylation exhibited partial loss of asynchrony and a shift toward earlier replication times. These results indicate that in BWS, (1) H19 imprinting alterations are less frequent than previously estimated, (2) IGF2 imprinting and H19 imprinting are not necessarily coordinated, and (3) alterations in regional replication timing are generally not correlated with either chromosomal rearrangements or the imprinting status of IGF2 and H19.
