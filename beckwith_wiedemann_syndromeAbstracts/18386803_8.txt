The etiology of gastroschisis and omphalocele is unclear and their pathogenesis is controversial. Because previous reports have inconsistently noted the type and frequency of malformations associated with omphalocele and gastroschisis, we assessed these associated malformations ascertained between 1979 and 2003 in 334,262 consecutive births. Of the 86 patients with omphalocele, 64 (74.4%) had associated malformations. These included patients with chromosomal abnormalities (25, 29.0%); non-chromosomal syndromes including Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Goltz syndrome, Marshall-Smith syndrome, Meckel-Gruber syndrome, Oto-palato-digital type II syndrome, CHARGE syndrome, and fetal valproate syndrome; malformation sequences, including ectopia cordis, body stalk anomaly, exstrophy of bladder, exstrophy of cloaca, and OEIS (Omphalocele, Exstrophy of bladder, Imperforate anus, Spinal defect); malformation complexes including Pentalogy of Cantrell, and non-syndromic multiple congenital anomalies (MCA) (26, 30.2%). Malformations of the musculoskeletal system (31, 23.5%), urogenital system (27, 20.4%), cardiovascular system (20, 15.1%), and central nervous system (12, 9.1%) were the most common other congenital malformations in patients with omphalocele and non-syndromic MCA. Of the 60 patients with gastroschisis, 10 (16.6%) had associated malformations. In contrast to omphalocele, gastroschisis was rarely associated with a complex pattern of malformation, that is, one each (1.7%) with a chromosomal abnormality (trisomy 21), sequence (amyoplasia congenita), unspecified dwarfism, and 7 (11.7%) with MCA. We observed a striking difference in the prevalence of total malformations (74.4% vs. 16.6%, P < 0.001) and specific patterns of malformations associated with omphalocele and gastroschisis which emphasizes the need to evaluate all patients with omphalocele and gastroschisis for possible associated malformations. Malformation surveillance programs should be aware that the malformations associated with omphalocele can be often classified into a recognizable malformation syndrome or pattern (44.2%).
