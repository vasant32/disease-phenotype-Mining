The differential diagnosis of prenatally diagnosed adrenal masses includes neuroblastoma, adrenal hemorrhage, adrenal and cortical renal cysts, adrenal adenoma and carcinoma, subdiaphragmatic pulmonary sequestration, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, duplication of the renal system, Wilms tumors, congenital mesoblastic nephroma, and mesenteric and enteric duplication cysts. The worldwide annual incidence of childhood adrenal cortical neoplasms ranges between 0.3 and 0.38 per 1 million children younger than 15 years. These neoplasms are even more unusual among infants, with only 23 cases reported in the literature.
