The experience with adrenocortical neoplasms in childhood is reviewed. During three decades, ten children with adrenocortical neoplasms were seen at the authors' institution. The literature was reviewed, and 209 patients 16.5 years or younger were found. All ten patients at Vanderbilt University Hospital (VUH) presented with endocrine manifestations of the tumor. Three patients had Cushing's, two patients had virilization, and five patients had features of both. In the literature, virilization, alone or with Cushing's, was the most common mode of presentation. Feminizing tumors were uncommon and nonfunctional tumors rare. The majority of patients were female. Features associated with malignancy included 17-KS levels greater than 40 mg/24 hr, diameter greater than 6 cm, weight greater than 500 g, and histologic evidence of diffuse growth pattern, vascular invasion, and tumor cell necrosis. Although uncommon, adrenocortical neoplasms should be suspected in children with Cushing's, virilization, feminization, or a combination of these. There has been an increased incidence reported in patients with hemihypertrophy, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, hemangiomas, and nevi. Following endocrinologic evaluation, imaging studies should be performed. CT scan appears to be the most useful diagnostic tool. A posterior operative approach is recommended for suspected adenomas. An anterior thoracoabdominal approach is favored for suspected malignancies with uncompromised en bloc resection. There is no evidence that adjuvant therapy provides any additional benefit.
