Mice lacking the imprinted Cdk inhibitor p57(KIP2) have altered cell proliferation and differentiation, leading to abdominal muscle defects; cleft palate; endochondral bone ossification defects with incomplete differentiation of hypertrophic chondrocytes; renal medullary dysplasia; adrenal cortical hyperplasia and cytomegaly; and lens cell hyperproliferation and apoptosis. Many of these phenotypes are also seen in patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, a pleiotropic hereditary disorder characterized by overgrowth and predisposition to cancer, suggesting that loss of p57(KIP2) expression may play a role in the condition.
