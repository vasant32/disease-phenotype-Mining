 BACKGROUND: Although multiple methods of tongue reduction have been described, recent literature suggests that the central reductions may be more favorable in patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). In this case series, we review our experience with macroglossia associated with BWS, and we offer a new technique of central tongue reduction. METHODS: Between 1993 and 2007, a retrospective chart review was conducted to include all patients with a diagnosis of BWS who have undergone stellate or double stellate tongue reduction at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin. RESULTS: A total of 7 patients met all inclusion criteria. All patients had good tongue mobility at 1-year follow-up. One patient required speech therapy for persistent articulation errors postoperatively. A total of 2 patients required secondary procedures for recurrent macroglossia. There were no complaints of abnormal taste or sensation. CONCLUSIONS: The stellate and double stellate tongue reductions provide effective treatment in macroglossia associated with BWS.
