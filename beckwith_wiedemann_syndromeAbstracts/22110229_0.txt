 BACKGROUND: Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) is a genomic imprinting disorder characterized by overgrowth and increased risk of malignancy. We studied the oxidative stress (OS) pattern of our patients with BWS and administered, for the first time, potassium ascorbate with ribose (PAR) once a day as long-term therapy in order to correct the effects induced by free radicals. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We describe the clinical features of three patients examined every three months in our clinic. OS was ascertained by measuring a panel of OS biomarkers: non-protein-binding iron, total hydroperoxides, advanced oxidation protein products, isoprostanes, carbonyl groups and thiols. After the presence of OS was established, treatment with PAR was started at the dosage of 300 mg of Potassium Bicarbonate and 150 mg of Ascorbic Acid in aqueous solution and changes occurring in OS biomarkers were followed dosing every three months. RESULTS: Our patients showed higher levels of OS biomarkers than controls at the time of diagnosis. There was a reduction in OS biomarker values for all three patients with treatment. No primary or secondary neoplastic disease was observed in 9 months of follow-up. CONCLUSION: This is the first report showing OS occurring in BWS. No drug until this report has been published showing efficacy against OS in any cancer. Given the limited number of patients, care must be taken to mitigate enthusiasm. We are collecting data for a large number of BWS patients to confirm these preliminary results.
