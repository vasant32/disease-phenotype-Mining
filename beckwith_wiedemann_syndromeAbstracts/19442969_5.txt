OBJECTIVE: To describe the molecular and cytogenetic characterization of two different prenatal cases of androgenetic/biparental mosaicism and review the different possible mechanisms of origin in each case. DESIGN: Case study and literature review. SETTING: Tertiary medical center (prenatal diagnosis unit). PATIENT(S): A 26-year-old pregnant woman referred for suspected partial mole placenta and a 33-year-old pregnant woman referred for polyhydramnios and fetal malformations. INTERVENTION(S): Ultrasound examination, prenatal invasive procedures, molecular and cytogenetic analysis, physical and pathologic evaluation, and genetic counseling. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Cytogenetic analysis, fluorescent in situ hybridization, and quantitative fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (QF-PCR) analysis. RESULT(S): The finding of a normal karyotype together with a triploidy-like QF-PCR profile led to the diagnosis of two cases of androgenetic (genome-wide paternal uniparental disomy)/biparental mosaicism. The first case showed placental mesenchymal dysplasia and a normal fetus, and the second one presented a fetus showing Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome features and an apparently normal placenta. CONCLUSION(S): These cases highlight the wide range of possible clinical presentations of androgenetic/biparental mosaicism, the variety of mechanisms of their origin, and the importance of the combination of molecular and cytogenetic analysis to achieve an accurate diagnosis and provide reproductive counseling.
