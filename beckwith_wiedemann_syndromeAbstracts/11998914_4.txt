We describe a 19-year-old female, known to have congenital hemihypertrophy, who presented with bilateral benign pheochromocytoma. This is the second time that this combination has been reported in the literature. We speculate that the combination of congenital hemihypertrophy and pheochromocytoma is not coincidental and could be part of the clinical spectrum of the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. CONCLUSION: in patients with congenital hemihypertrophy, the physician should be aware of the symptoms of pheochromocytoma. Besides screening for abdominal tumours, analysis of plasma and/or urinary catecholamines and/or their metabolites should be considered.
