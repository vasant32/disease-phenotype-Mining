Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) is associated with somatic overgrowth and a high risk for embryonal tumors, including hepatoblastoma, a highly malignant liver tumor of childhood. Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), on the other hand, is a benign tumor of the liver that is uncommon in childhood. Herein we describe a case of FNH in a child with BWS, the first such report in the literature.
