Acute increases in sympathetic activity, plasma catecholamine concentrations and myocardial damage, occur following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in Wistar rats. Hypertension is a major risk factor for stroke. The autonomic responses to MCAO in the spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were therefore investigated. Arterial pressure (AP), heart rate (HR), renal sympathetic nerve discharge (SND), plasma catecholamines and ECG were measured in 16 SHR and 16 WKY male urethane-anesthetized rats, which were subjected to either MCAO or sham MCAO. Cerebral infarct size did not differ between SHR and WKY rats, as shown by tetrazolium staining. Initial AP was significantly higher in SHR (96 +/- 4 mmHg) than in WKY (70 +/- 1 mmHg; P < 0.05). No significant differences in initial HR or plasma catecholamine levels were observed between SHR and WKY. By 6 hours after MCAO, AP, SND and plasma epinephrine in SHR decreased significantly, while HR showed a significant increase. SND and plasma catecholamines in the WKY showed increases that did not reach significant levels following MCAO. The QT interval of the ECG was significantly prolonged in the WKY MCAO rats, which also had a higher frequency of cardiac myocytolysis than the other groups. Unlike the increases in autonomic variables following MCAO in Wistar rats, SHR exhibit significant decreases in SND and AP, while WKY show slight, but non-significant increases. These differences in the autonomic reaction to MCAO may reflect genetic differences in the response to cerebral ischemia.
