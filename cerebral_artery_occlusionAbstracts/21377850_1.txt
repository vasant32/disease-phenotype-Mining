The neuronal damage following cerebral ischemia is a serious risk to stroke patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of alkaloid extract from Leonurus heterophyllus (LHAE) on cerebral ischemic injury. After 24 h of reperfusion following ischemia for 2 h induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), some rats were intraperitoneally administered different doses of LHAE (3.6, 7.2, 14.4 mg/kg, respectively). Neurological examination was measured in all animals. Infarct volume, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, levels of nitrate/nitrite metabolite (NO) and apoptosis ratio of nerve fiber in brain were determined. The results showed that LHAE at 7.2 mg/kg or 14.4 mg/kg exerted significantly decreasing neurological deficit scores and reducing the infarct volume on rats with focal cerebral ischemic injury (p<0.05). At those dose, the MPO content were significantly decreased in ischemic brain as compared with model group (p<0.05). LHAE at 14.4 mg/kg significantly decreased the NO level compared with the model group (p<0.05). In addition, LHAE significantly decreased the apoptosis ratio of nerve fiber compared with the model group (p<0.05). This study suggests that LHAE may be used for treatment of ischemic stroke as a neuroprotective agent. Further studies are warranted to assess the efficacy and safety of LHAE in patients.
