The effect of anti-intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (anti-ICAM-1) antibody treatment of transient (2 h) middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in the rat was measured using diffusion (DWI)-, T2 (T2I)- and perfusion (PWI)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Rats were treated upon reperfusion with an anti-ICAM-1 monoclonal antibody (n=11) or a control antibody (n=7). DWI, T2I and PWI were performed before, during, and after induction of focal cerebral ischemia from 1 h to 7 days. In both groups, the apparent diffusion coefficient of water (ADCw) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) values in the ischemic region significantly declined from the preischemic ADCw values (p<0. 05). The post ischemic increase in T2 of the control group was significantly higher at 48 h than in the anti-ICAM-1 treated group (p<0.05). CBF was not significantly different between the two groups. The temporal profiles of MRI cluster analysis, which combines ADCw and T2 maps into a single image, was significantly different between groups. These data suggest that the neuroprotective effect of anti-ICAM-1 antibody treatment is reflected in reductions of T2 and lesion growth during reperfusion and may not be associated with increased cerebral perfusion.
