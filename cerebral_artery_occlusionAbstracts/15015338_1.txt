OBJECTIVE: To study the protection of seed oil of Hippophae rhamnoides on ischemic cerebral infarction in rats and the mechanism of the action. METHOD: Focal cerebral ischemia model was made by middle cerebral artery occlusion(MCAO) in rats. Behavior obstacles of rats were observed. Cerebral infarction volume was determined by Megnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI). RESULT: Seed oil of Hippophae rhamnides 0.7 and 0.35 g.kg-1 could markedly reduce infarction volume after occlusion of middle cerebral artery in rats and also could ameliorate the behavior obstacles of rats. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that seed oil of Hippophae rhamnoides had distinct protection to ischemic cerebral infarction in rats.
