Remote areas undergoing delayed neuronal degeneration after focal brain ischemia display a preceding glial activation. The expression of proinflammatory cytokines there has not been examined so far. We examined the expression of TNFalpha in the thalamus and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) 1, 3 and 7 days after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) of the rat. We used antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), OX-42, NeuN and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) for immunohistochemistry/double-immunofluorescent labeling to investigate the time course of glial activation and the cellular localization of TNFalpha. Neuronal degeneration was measured by means of cell counting in Nissl-stained sections. In the ipsilateral thalamus, TNFalpha was upregulated already 1 day after MCAO. Microglia and astroglia were activated after 3 days. A cellular colocalisation of GFAP and TNFalpha was observed. Neuronal degeneration was evident at day 14. In the SNr, TNFalpha expression was enhanced 3 days after MCAO. Microglia was activated after 3 days and astroglia after 7 days. A cellular colocalisation of NeuN and TNFalpha was observed. Neuronal degeneration was evident at day 14. Thus, in both areas, expression of TNFalpha precedes astrogliosis and neuronal degeneration. The different patterns of TNFalpha upregulation of the substantia nigra pars reticulata and the thalamus following middle cerebral artery occlusion may reflect different pathophysiological mechanisms leading to remote neuronal degeneration.
