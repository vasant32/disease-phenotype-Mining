Intracerebral pO2, as measured in normal dog brains by a modified mass spectrometer, was found to increase following seizure activity and remain elevated at least 2 hours. These results were found with both drug- and electrically-induced seizures. The pO2 increased to a greater degree in brain tissue rendered ischemic by middle cerebral artery occlusion. A transient reflex hypertension was observed with seizure activity, but hypertension alone failed to produce significant pO2 changes. Since oxidative metabolism has been shown by other investigators to proceed at an elevated rate during seizure activity, the increased pO2 must reflect improved collateral circulation following seizure activity.
