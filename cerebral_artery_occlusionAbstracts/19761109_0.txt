OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) of "Baihui" (GV 20) and "Dazhui" (GV 14) on the ultrastructure of cerebral cortex in rats with cerebral ischemia reperfusion (CI/R) injury. METHODS: Fifteen SD rats were equally randomized into sham-operation (sham), model and EA groups. CI/R model was established by right middle cerebral artery occlusion for 1 h and reperfusion for 24 h. EA (20 Hz/80 Hz, 1-3 mA) was applied to "Baihui" (GV 20) and "Dazhui" (GV 14) for 30 min. The ischemic cerebral cortex tissue was taken, fixed in 2.5% glutaral solution, embedded in araldite, cut into sections and stained for observing the ultrastructure changes of cortical pyramidal cells, astrocyte and blood brain barrier (BBB) under transmission electronic microscope. RESULTS: In sham group, the anatomical structure of the cerebral pyramidal cells was normal basically. In model group, the neuronal mitochondria and the capillary endothelium and the processes of the astrocyte got swelling, the mitochondrial cristae were broken, the capillary lumens became narrow or were blocked up. In EA group, the injury degree of the pyramidal cells, glial cells and BBB were lighter. CONCLUSION: EA can reduce ischemic injury of the cerebral cortical neurons and blood brain barrier in rats with CI/R injury.
