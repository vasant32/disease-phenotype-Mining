Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been demonstrated to have neuroprotective effects in rat model with focal cerebral ischemia through anti-apoptotic pathways and by promoting proliferation of neural stem cells. In the present study, we examined the neuroprotective effect of G-CSF in an acute focal cerebral ischemia rat model with lipid metabolism disorder. Eighty male SD rats were randomly divided into normal diet control group (NC group) and high-fat diet group (HFD group) (n = 40 in each). In HFD group, rats were fed on high fat diet to induce atherosclerosis. After 29 days, 4 rats from each group were sacrificed to evaluate the effects of different diets, and the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was performed in the rest of the rats. MCAO rats received either G-CSF (50 μg·kg(-1)·mL(-1)) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) injection through the external jugular vein for 5 days, which was followed by 5-bromo-deoxy uridine (BrdU, i.p., 50 mg/kg) injection for another 7 days. To evaluate the effects of G-CSF treatment on neurological function, the modified neurological severity score (mNSS) was calculated. The vascular distribution, ischemic cells proliferation, cell apoptosis and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were measured to determine the effects of G-CSF treatment. Our results showed that G-CSF-treated rats had a lower mNSS than PBS-treated rats in both NC group and HFD group. G-CSF injection promoted endothelial cell proliferation and vascular regeneration, and inhibited cell apoptosis. The serum and tissue levels of VEGF were significantly increased after G-CSF treatment. It is concluded that G-CSF exerts its neuroprotective effect in focal cerebral ischemia rats with hyperlipidemia by enhancing angiogenesis, promoting cells proliferation, decreasing cell apoptosis, and increasing local VEGF expression.
