1. Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) factors are a family of transcription factors that mediate intracellular signalling initiated at cytokine cell surface receptors and transmitted to the nucleus. In the present study, we determined the global changes in STAT gene expression in the hippocampus of rats after focal cerebral ischaemia and reperfusion using microarray analysis. 2. The present study used middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) to induce ischaemia and reperfusion in Sprague-Dawley rats. Using superarray Q series Janus tyrosine kinases (Jak)/STAT signalling pathway gene array, a total of 96 genes was screened in adult male rat hippocampus after transient focal cerebral ischaemia. 3. The results showed that 23 genes were upregulated at least twofold by ischaemia treatment and that 12 genes were downregulated at least threefold by ischaemia treatment compared with controls. 4. After confirmation by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, the data suggest that the gene expression of STAT2, 5a, 5b, 6 and suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) 4 was increased by ischaemia, probably due to a compensatory response of the brain, which may play a protective role in damaged brain tissue. 5. The results of the present study provide evidence on global changes in STAT gene expression in the hippocampus of rats after focal cerebral ischaemia and reperfusion, in which STAT2, 5a, 5b, 6 and SOCS4 were confirmed to be significantly modulated during focal cerebral ischaemia.
