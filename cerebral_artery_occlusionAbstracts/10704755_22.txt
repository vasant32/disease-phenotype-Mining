Delayed treatment with nicotinamide (NAm) protects male rats against cerebral ischemia. Since the preponderant use of male animals in stroke research may produce results not applicable to female stroke patients due to gender-related differences, we examined whether delayed NAm treatment could protect female rats against focal cerebral ischemia using a model of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). NAm (500 mg/kg) given intravenously, 2 h after MCAo, significantly reduced the infarct volume of female Sprague-Dawley (55%, P<0.05) and Wistar rats (60%, P<0.05) rats when compared with saline-injected controls. These studies confirm that NAm is neuroprotective specifically at the dose of 500 mg/kg in rats. The novel findings are that this neuroprotection occurs in female, as well as male rats, and that the neuroprotection observed is more robust when administered as an intravenous bolus compared with intraperitoneal administration.
