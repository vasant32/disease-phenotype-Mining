Experimental and clinical data suggest that iron has a key role in cerebral ischaemia. We measure infarct volume and analyse the nitric oxide responses to brain injury in rat stroke model after increased oral iron intake. Permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was performed in a group of 20 male Wistar rats, 10 of which were fed with a control diet and 10 of which were fed with iron-enriched diet containing 2.5% carbonyl iron for 9 weeks. L-arginine and nitric oxide metabolites were determined in blood samples before and at 2, 6, 8 and 48 h after MCAO. Infarct volume, thiobarbituric acid reaction substances (TBARS) and tissue iron were measured at 48 h. Infarct volume was 66% greater in the iron-fed rats than in the control group. Iron-fed animals showed significantly higher levels of TBARS. Liver iron stores (3500 +/- 199 vs 352 +/- 28 microg Fe/g, p<0.0001) but not brain iron stores (131 +/- 11 vs 139 +/- 8 microg Fe/g, p=0.617), were significantly higher in the iron-fed group. L-arginine levels were slightly lower in iron-fed rats and decreased significantly in both groups at 6 and 8 hours after MCAO. The levels of the stable end products of NOS (NOx = nitrite + nitrate) were significantly higher in iron-fed rats before MCAO (16.2 +/- 2.2 vs. 9.6 +/- 0.8 micromol x L(-1), p<0.05), with a further increase during the six first hours after MCAO in both groups. These results suggest that the iron overload that increases both superoxide and nitric oxide production leads to peroxynitrite formation, thus enhancing brain damage.
