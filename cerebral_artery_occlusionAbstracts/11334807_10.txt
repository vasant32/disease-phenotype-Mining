Several kidney cell lines were investigated for their ability to produce glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Cell line-conditioned medium was analyzed using ELISA and two cell lines were identified which produce GDNF in physiologically active concentrations. ELISA analyses revealed that conditioned medium from these two cell lines also contained PDGF, bFGF, TGFbeta1 and TGFbeta2. Both of these cell lines were then transplanted into the striatal penumbra of rats, 1 h following middle cerebral artery occlusion. Behavioral testing revealed that both cell lines reduced the deficit associated with cerebral ischemia and reduced the infarct volume relative to controls. Reduction of infarct volume was likely achieved by the action of GDNF and/or other growth factors produced by the cells.
