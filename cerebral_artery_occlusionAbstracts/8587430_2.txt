This investigation demonstrates an increase in endothelin (ET)-mediated vascular tone in peri-ischemic areas after experimental focal cerebral ischemia (middle cerebral artery occlusion) in the cat. Adventitial application of the butenolide antagonist PD155080 (30 microM), after MCA occlusions resulted in marked increases in caliber of dilated (10.6 +/- 1.6% change from preinjection baseline) and constricted vessels (68.7 +/- 17.5% change from pre-injection baseline). Cerebral blood flow (measured by laser Doppler flowmetry) was reduced after MCA occlusion to 50% of preocclusion levels. Intravenous administration of PD156707 30 min after MCA occlusion restored cerebral blood flow to preocclusion baseline levels at 6 h. The volume of ischemic damage in the cerebral hemisphere after MCA occlusion was significantly reduced (by 45%) after intravenous administration of PD156707.
