The monofilament technique of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was used in 3 separate studies to evaluate the efficacy of the low-affinity, use-dependent N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, AR-R15896AR. First, a dose-response curve was attempted. Wister Kyoto rats received 2 hours of MCAO. Five minutes later, a 30-minute intravenous infusion of AR-R15896AR was given, followed by subcutaneous implantation of Alzet minipumps that were calibrated to maintain specified plasma levels (approximately 682, 1885, or 2682 ng/mL) of AR-R15896 (free base) for 1 week. The highest plasma level attained significantly decreased the percentage of damage to the subcortex, cortex, and total brain. Second, the high-dose, 1-week treatment regimen was repeated to determine if neuroprotection would extend to 8 weeks after MCAO. Indeed, in separate groups of animals, significant reduction in the percentage of damage, which was generally confined to the cortex and subcortex, was observed at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks. Third, verification was achieved in another laboratory. Lister Hooded rats received 60 minutes of transient MCAO. At 70 minutes, an acute dose of AR-R15896AR (20.3 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally and the rats were killed 23 hours later. This treatment group also exhibited significant reduction in the volume of infarction in the subcortex, cortex, and total brain. The outcome of these investigations supports the ongoing Phase II clinical trials in patients with acute stroke.
