BACKGROUND: Treadmill training is used for promoting rhythmical vigorous walking and for task-related training in patients with stroke. The neurological impact of treadmill training has not been established. The present investigation is aimed at (1) examining neurological changes over a four-week period after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats and (2) assessing the impact of one-week, two-week and four-week treadmill training in MCAO rats. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 60-minute right MCAO. All rats were randomly assigned to one of seven groups. Infarct volume and neurological score were measured. RESULTS: Rats sacrificed 24 hours post MCAO had the largest infarct volumes (171.4 +/- 14.4 mm3) and the highest neurological score (median: 2, range: 1-3). We noted that without treadmill training, infarct sizes and neurological score diminished with time. Treadmill training for at least one week further reduced infarct volume and significantly improved neurologic function in MCAO rats. CONCLUSION: Treadmill training after focal cerebral ischemia significantly improves neurological outcome in MCAO rats. Treadmill training may be beneficial for ischemic brain recovery.
