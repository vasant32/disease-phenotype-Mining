Expressions of cell-cycle regulating proteins are altered after stroke. Cell-cycle inhibition has shown dramatic reduction in infarction after stroke. Ceramide can induce cell-cycle arrest by up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitors p21 and p27 through activation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Tricyclodecan-9-yl-xanthogenate (D609)-increased ceramide levels after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) probably by inhibiting sphingomyelin synthase (SMS). D609 significantly reduced cerebral infarction and up-regulated Cdk inhibitor p21 and down-regulated phospho-retinoblastoma (pRb) expression after tMCAO in rat. Others have suggested bFGF-induced astrocyte proliferation is attenuated by D609 due to an increase in ceramide by SMS inhibition. D609 also reduced the formation of oxidized phosphatidylcholine (OxPC) protein adducts. D609 may attenuate generation of reactive oxygen species and formation of OxPC by inhibiting microglia/macrophage proliferation after tMCAO (please also see note added in proof: D609 may prevent mature neurons from entering the cell cycle at the early reperfusion, however may not interfere with later proliferation of microglia/ macrophages that are the source of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) in offering protection). It has been proposed that D609 provides benefit after tMCAO by attenuating hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha and Bcl2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa interacting protein 3 expressions. Our data suggest that D609 provides benefit after stoke through inhibition of SMS, increased ceramide levels, and induction of cell-cycle arrest by up-regulating p21 and causing hypophosphorylation of Rb (through increased protein phosphatase activity and/or Cdk inhibition).
