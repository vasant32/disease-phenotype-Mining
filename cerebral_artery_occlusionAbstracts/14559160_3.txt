Biochemical changes in rat brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and molecular isoform distribution were studied using the middle cerebral artery occlusion model. After 24 h of permanent focal ischemia, AChE specific activity from infarcted cortex was found to decrease compared with contralateral cortex. Also a decrease in the minor monomeric (G1) form of AChE is response to ischemia was observed. Ischemia-induced AChE decrease was partially diminished by pre-treatment with dizocilpine (MK-801), a neuroprotective NMDA receptor blocker.
