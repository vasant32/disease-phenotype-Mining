Astrocytes play a pivotal role in cerebral glutamate homeostasis. After 90 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat, the changes induced in neuronal and astrocytic metabolism and in the neuronal-astrocytic interactions were studied by combining in vivo injection of [1-13C]glucose and [1,2-13C]acetate with ex vivo 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and HPLC analysis of amino acids of the lateral caudoputamen and lower parietal cortex, representing the putative ischemic core, and the upper frontoparietal cortex, corresponding to the putative penumbra. In the putative ischemic core, evidence of compromised de novo glutamate synthesis located specifically in the glutamatergic neurons was detected, and a larger proportion of glutamate was derived from astrocytic glutamine. In the same region, pyruvate carboxylase activity, representing the anaplerotic pathway in the brain and exclusively located in astrocytes, was abolished. However, astrocytic glutamate uptake and conversion to glutamine took place, and cycling of intermediates in the astrocytic tricarboxylic acid cycle was elevated. In the putative penumbra, glutamate synthesis was improved compared with the ischemic core, the difference appeared to be brought on by better neuronal de novo glutamate synthesis, combined with normal levels of glutamate formed from astrocytic glutamine. In both ischemic regions, gamma-aminobutyric acid synthesis directly from glucose was reduced to about half, indicating impaired pyruvate dehydrogenase activity; still, gamma-aminobutyric acid reuptake and cycling was increased. The results obtained in the current study demonstrate that by combining in vivo injection of [1-13C]glucose and [1,2-13C]acetate with ex vivo 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, specific metabolic alterations in small regions within the rat brain suffering a focal ischemic lesion can be studied.
