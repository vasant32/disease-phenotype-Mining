We have previously reported that ischemia reperfusion injury results from free radical generation following transient global ischemia, and that this radical induced damage is evident in the synaptosomal membrane of the gerbil. [Hall et al, (1995) Neuroscience 64: 81-89]. In the present study we have extended these observations to transient focal ischemia in the cat. We prepared synaptosomal membranes from frontal, parietal-temporal, and occipital regions of the cat cerebral cortex with reperfusion times of 1 and 3 hours following 1 hour right middle cerebral artery occlusion. The membranes were selectively labeled with protein and lipid specific paramagnetic spin labels and analyzed using electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometry. There were significant motional changes of both the protein and lipid specific spin labels in the parietal-temporal and occipital regions with 1 hour reperfusion; but, both parameters returned to control values by 3 hours reperfusion. No significant changes were observed in the normally perfused frontal pole at either reperfusion time. These results support the argument that free radicals play a critical role in cell damage at early reperfusion times following ischemia.
