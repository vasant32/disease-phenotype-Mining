This study investigates the influence on tromethamine (THAM) on ischemic volume induced by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. 14 male Sprague Dawley rats underwent left sided permanent MCAO by electro coagulation. Animals were treated either by 3-M THAM given intravenously in a single dosage of 0.6 mmol/kg body weight (THAM group: n = 7) 10 min following MCAO and again 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 hours later or by NaCl 0.9% (placebo group: n = 7) in the same mode. Mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was monitored for 30 min post MCAO and arterial blood gases were taken 10 min after the first injection. The extent of ischemia volume was assessed by planimetry of coronal sections stained with triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride (TTC) and with hematoxilin/eosin (HE). Tests for significance were accomplished by ANOVA on ranks. A difference of p < 0.05 was considered significant. The THAM group showed an insignificant decrease in MABP 1 min after injection (THAM: 75 +/- 11 mmHg, placebo: 86 +/- 10 mmHg). Arterial pH was significantly different (THAM: 7.46 +/- 0.04; placebo: 7.32 +/- 0.03). In TTC staining, the ischemia volume--given in absolute values and percentage of the total left volume--was significantly reduced in the THAM group (THAM: 43.9 +/- 8.3 mm3/7.0 +/- 1.3%; placebo: 95.2 +/- 13.8 mm3/14.2 +/- 2.0%). In HE staining, the reduction of ischemia, volume did not reach statistical significance (THAM: 49.1 +/- 9.9 mm3/9.6 +/- 1.8%; placebo: 66.3 +/- 14.5 mm3/13.1 +/- 2.8%). Based on these results, a moderate neuroprotective effect of THAM in experimental cerebral infarction could be demonstrated.
