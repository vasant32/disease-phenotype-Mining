Oxidative stress and inflammatory damage play an important role in cerebral ischemic pathogenesis and may represent a target for treatment. Celastrol has been proved to elicit a vanity of biological effects through its anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory properties in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis. However, little is known regarding the effect of celastrol in the acute phase of ischemic stroke. This study investigated the potential protective effects of celastrol and underlying mechanisms in cerebral ischemia. We used a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) model and administered celastrol intraperitoneally immediately after stroke. At 24h after stroke, we found that celastrol dramatically reduced neurological deficit, brain water content and infarct sizes, and downregulated the expression of p-JNK, p-c-Jun and NF-κB. The results indicated that celastrol may have the possibility of protective effect against ischemic injury, and this effect may be through downregulation of the expression of p-JNK, p-c-Jun and NF-κB.
