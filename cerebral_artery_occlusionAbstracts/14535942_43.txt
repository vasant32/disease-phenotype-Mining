Progenitor cells in the dentate gyrus of hippocampus (DG) and the subventricular zone of lateral ventricles (SVZ) generate new neurons throughout the life of mammals. Cerebral ischemia increases this basal progenitor cell proliferation. The present study evaluated the time frame of proliferation, length of survival and the phenotypes of the new cells formed after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in adult spontaneously hypertensive rats. Compared to sham controls, ischemic rats showed a significantly higher number of newly proliferated cells (as defined by BrdU immunostaining) in both the DG (by fourfold, p < 0.05) and the SVZ (by twofold, p < 0.05). DG showed increased proliferation only in the first week of reperfusion and 49% of the cells formed in this period survived to the end of third week. Whereas, SVZ showed a continuous proliferation up to 3 weeks after MCAO, but the cells formed survived for less than a week. In both DG and SVZ, at the end of the first week of reperfusion, majority of the BrdU-positive (BrdU+) cells were immature neurons (DCX positive). In the DG, 28% of the cells formed in the first week after MCAO mature into neurons (NeuN positive). The ischemic cortex and striatum showed several BrdU+ cells which were ED-1 positive microglia/macrophages. At 1 week of reperfusion, MCAO-induced progenitor cell proliferation in the ipsilateral DG was significantly increased by i.c.v. infusion of IGF-1 (by 127 +/- 14%, p < 0.05) and GDNF (by 91 +/- 5%, p < 0.05), compared to vehicle. In the growth factor treated rats subjected to transient MCAO, several BrdU+ cells formed in the first week survived up to the third week.
