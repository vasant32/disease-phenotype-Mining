Impairment of energy metabolism is the fundamental mechanism leading to cell death in ischemia. Using the middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion model in cats, we studied the effect of Duxil (almitrine and raubasine combination), which was given either before and after or only after MCA occlusion, on ischemia in terms of neurological function and histological changes. Neurological function was assessed consecutively for 7 days after MCA occlusion using a categorical rating scale in 18 cats. Neurological function was significantly improved in treated animals than in non-treated controls regarding to the motor and sensory function, walking, posture and stepping reflex. Animals were killed on the 8th day and histological changes were examined by light and electron microscopies. Significant improvement in the morphological scores based on the light-microscopy changes were found in animals treated with Duxil compared to non-treated ones. Under the electron microscopy, the protective effects of Duxil were characterized by retaining glycogen and mitochondria. Morphological improvement was associated with the recovery of neurological function and especially profound in penumbra areas of MCA infarction. These results suggest that Duxil has a protective effect against ischemic damage induced by occlusion of MCA in cats.
