Oxidative stress-induced neuronal cell death has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases; one such disease is ischemic stroke. Using reactive oxygen species (ROS)-insulted primary neurons, we screened neuroprotectants with clinical potential and then, using ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) model, investigated the anti-ischemic potential of candidate neuroprotectants. Here, we showed that luteolin, isolated from the ripe fruit of Perilla frutescens (L.) Britt, exhibited a neuroprotective action upon the in vitro platform, thus serving as candidate for in vivo pharmacological evaluation. Liposome-encapsulated luteolin produced dramatic preventing effects on I/R-induced behavioral and histological injuries after a 13-day post-ischemic treatment. Furthermore, this phytochemical not only lowered the increased level of mitochondrial ROS but also substantially up-regulated the decreased activity of catalase and glutathione in I/R rat brains. Collectively, luteolin as a neuroprotectant acts by anti-ischemic activity likely through a rebalancing of pro-oxidant/antioxidant status. Its multitarget mechanisms implicate potential effectiveness for clinically treating ischemia stroke.
