A highly reproducible model of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in rat is described. Reproducibility relates to MCA occlusion at its most proximal portion and the surgical approach through a widened foramen ovale, thus avoiding craniotomy and brain retraction. Spontaneous ventilation is maintained, avoiding intubation. Collateral circulation to cortex is preserved, permitting optimal metabolic and pharmacologic studies of the ischemic regions destined for infarction.
