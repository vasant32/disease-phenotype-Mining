 OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of Buyang Huanwu decoction (BYHWD) on pro-inflammatory cytokines in rats after focal cerebral infarction. METHODS: Adult Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into following groups: normal control, sham, model, BYHWD. The rats in latter three groups were subdivided into subgroups of 1, 3, and 7 days after medication, with 5 rats in each group. The right side focal cerebral infarction model was reproduced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The rats in BYHWD group were gavaged with BYHWD of 10 ml/kg (14.2 g/kg, once a day) 2 hours after operation. Animals were sacrificed at corresponding time points. The protein and mRNA expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: There were low levels expression of IL-1β and TNF-α protein and mRNA in normal control group and the sham group. After cerebral infarction, the protein and mRNA expression of IL-1β and TNF-α began to increase in rats 1 day after the insult, and the protein and mRNA expression of IL-1β reached the peak on 3rd day, and then lowered, and the protein and mRNA expression of TNF-α reached the peak on 7th day. Compared with model group on 1st, 3rd and 7th day, the protein expression of IL-1β (ng/L: 90.290±8.693 vs. 102.556±13.934 on 1st day, 129.632±11.050 vs. 150.117±8.552 on 3rd day, 66.185±9.020 vs. 91.362±9.901 on 7th day) and TNF-α (ng/L: 210.341±19.247 vs. 236.887±20.137 on 1st day, 267.503±21.006 vs. 322.659±15.068 on 3rd day, 299.637±17.717 vs. 386.678±16.297 on 7th day), and mRNA expression of IL-1β (1 day: 0.54±0.09 vs. 0.64±0.11, 3 days: 0.80±0.06 vs. 0.89±0.07, 7 days : 0.70±0.09 vs. 0.78±0.08) and TNF-α (1 day: 0.64±0.09 vs. 0.73±0.11, 3 days: 0.74±0.13 vs. 0.85±0.07 , 7 days : 0.82±0.07 vs. 0.93±0.08], were all decreased obviously in BYHWD group ( P<0.05 or P<0.01). CONCLUSION: BYHWD could reduce the protein and mRNA expressions of IL-1β and TNF-α in levels after cerebral infarction. The result shows that it protects brain by modulating expression of pro-inflammatory mediators.
