BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of local intra-arterial thrombolysis (LIT) using urokinase in patients with acute stroke due to middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. METHODS: We analyzed clinical and radiological findings and functional outcome 3 months after LIT with urokinase of 100 consecutive patients. To measure outcome, the modified Rankin scale (mRs) score was used. RESULTS: Angiography showed occlusion of the M1 segment of the MCA in 57 patients, of the M2 segment in 21, and of the M3 or M4 segment in 22. The median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at admission was 14, and, on average, 236 minutes elapsed from symptom onset to LIT. Forty-seven patients (47%) had an excellent outcome (mRs score 0 to 1), 21 (21%) a good outcome (mRs score 2), and 22 (22%) a poor outcome (mRs score 3 to 5). Ten patients (10%) died. Excellent or good outcome (mRs score < or =2) was seen in 59% of patients with M1 or M2 and 95% of those with M(3) or M(4) MCA occlusions. Recanalization as seen on angiography was complete (thrombolysis in myocardial infarction [TIMI] grade 3) in 20% of patients and partial (TIMI grade 2) in 56% of patients. Age <60 years (P<0.05), low NIHSS score at admission (P<0.00001), and vessel recanalization (P=0.0004) were independently associated with excellent or good outcome and diabetes with poor outcome (P=0.002). Symptomatic cerebral hemorrhage occurred in 7 patients (7%). CONCLUSIONS: LIT with urokinase that is administered by a single organized stroke team is safe and can be as efficacious as thrombolysis has been in large multicenter clinical trials.
