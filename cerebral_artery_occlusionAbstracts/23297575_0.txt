 OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of bloodletting puncture at Jing-Well points in the distal ends of the finger and toe on survival rate, survival time, and brain edema in rats with cerebral ischemia. METHODS: Fifty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups: normal, sham operation, model, bloodletting puncture at Jing-Well points in distal ends of finger and toe, and puncture without bloodletting at these points. Middle cerebral artery occlusion models were established according to Longa's method. The brains were taken 48 h after the model was established. Brain water content, brain density, brain coefficient, survival rate, and survival time in each group were measured. RESULTS: After bloodletting puncture, the survival time of the rats was prolonged, their brain water content and brain coefficient were reduced, and brain density was increased. CONCLUSION: Bloodletting puncture at Jing-Well points in the distal ends of the finger and toe can improve function in ischemic brain edema.
