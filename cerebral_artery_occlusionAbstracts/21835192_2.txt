The extracts of earth worms, Eisenia andrei, have been used as a therapeutic agent for stroke in the traditional medicine. It is also reported that the protease fraction separated from the extracts has strong anti-thrombotic activity. Besides anti-thrombotic actions, we found that SP-8203, N-[3-(2,4-dioxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl)propyl]-N-{4-[3-(2,4-dioxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl)propylamino]butyl}acetamide, derived from the extracts of earth worms blocked N-methyl-(D)-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated excitotoxicity in a competitive manner. The neuroprotective effects of SP-8203 were attributable to prevention of Ca(2+) influx through NMDA receptors. The systemic administration of SP-8203 markedly reduced neuronal death following middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats. SP-8203 significantly improved spatial learning and memory in the water maze test. These results provided strong pharmacological basis for its potential therapeutic roles in cerebral ischemia.
