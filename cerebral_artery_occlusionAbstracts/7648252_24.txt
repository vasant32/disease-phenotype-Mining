We immunohistochemically investigated the induction and localization of a low-molecular weight stress protein, HSP27, in the rat brain following 1 hr of middle cerebral artery occlusion in comparison with those of HSP70. The brains were perfusion-fixed after 4 h, 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, and 14 days of reperfusion. Frozen sections were then prepared and used for immunohistochemistry. In normal brains, we observed no immunoreactivities to HSP70 and HSP27. HSP70 was localized predominantly in neurons in areas peripheral to the ischemic center after 1 day and 3 days, and in endothelial cells and perivascular cells within the ischemic center after 1 day. In contrast, HSP27 was induced in microglia in the ischemic center after 4 h, and then in reactive astrocytes distributed widely in the ipsilateral hemisphere and in part of the contralateral hemisphere after 1 through 14 days. In the center of ischemia where infarction developed, only nonspecific staining was seen. Thus, the expression patterns of HSP70 and HSP27 were quite different with regard to cell type, distribution, and time course following focal cerebral ischemia. HSP70 may be a sensitive marker of acute neuronal stress in the penumbral areas, whereas HSP27, which was most prominently induced in reactive astrocytes in periischemic and remote areas, may be a component of glial reaction to injury.
