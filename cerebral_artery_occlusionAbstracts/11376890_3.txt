Growth associated protein-43 (GAP-43) gene induction may be involved in reactive events that follow cerebral ischemic damage. Antagonists of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subclass of glutamate receptors are thought to ameliorate functional outcome after ischemic injury. To assess whether glutamate NMDA receptor blockade could alter GAP-43 postischemic induction we performed immunocytochemistry in rat brains that had been subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion. Cortical cells did not constitutively express GAP-43, yet focal ischemia induced its expression, with an intense signal generated in cells over the lesioned area at 6 h, increasing at 24 h postischemia. This signal was effectively decreased by pretreatment with the NMDA receptor antagonist (5R,10S)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]-cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate (0.1 mg/kg s.c.), but not by the glutamate release blocker riluzole (8 mg/kg i.v.), suggesting that overactivation of NMDA receptor during ischemia is linked to GAP-43 expression.
