Mitochondrial division inhibitor (mdivi-1) is a derivative of quinazolinone that acts as a selective inhibitor of a mitochondrial fission protein Drp1. A previous study demonstrated that as a selective inhibitor of Drp1, mdivi-1 has a protective effect in an experimental model of heart ischemia/reperfusion injury. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of mdivi-1 on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in a middle cerebral artery occlusion mouse model. We found that mdivi-1 (1.2mg/kg) significantly reduced cerebral damage induced by ischemia/reperfusion. This neuroprotective effect was dose-dependent. Mdivi-1 treatment blocked apoptotic cell death in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, and significantly decreased the expression of Drp1 and Cytochrome C. These results suggest that mdivi-1 exerts neuroprotective effects against nerve injury after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion, and the underlying mechanism may be through the prevention of Cytochrome C release and suppression of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.
