The effects of the calcium channel blocker nimodipine and the non-competitive NMDA-antagonists MK-801 and phencyclidine (PCP) on infarct size 48 h after occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA-O) were evaluated in the rat. Nimodipine was given at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg s.c. 30 min prior and 8, 16, and 24 h after MCA-O. MK-801 (1 mg/kg i.p. or 10 mg/kg i.p.) or PCP (0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 10, or 30 mg/kg i.p.) were administered 30 min prior to ischemia. In additional experiments 30 mg/kg PCP was given 1, 3, or 5 h post ischemia. Nimodipine and 1 mg/kg MK-801 reduced cortical infarct volumes significantly by 50% and 55%, respectively, while cortical infarct size fell by 32% and total infarct volume was not altered significantly after administration of 10 mg/kg MK-801. Pretreatment with 10 or 30 mg/kg PCP reduced cortical infarction by 47-53% and total infarct volumes by 39-42%. Posttreatment with PCP was effective if started at 1 or 3 h post ischemia.
