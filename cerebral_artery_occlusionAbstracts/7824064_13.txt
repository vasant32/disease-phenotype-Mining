Excitatory amino acid release and neurotoxicity in the ischemic brain may be reduced by endogenously released adenosine which can modulate both glutamate or aspartate release and depress neuronal excitability. The present study reports on the patterns of release of glutamate and aspartate; the inhibitory amino acids GABA and glycine; and of the purine catabolites adenosine and inosine from the rat parietal cerebral cortex during 20 and 60 min periods of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion followed by reperfusion. Aspartate and glutamate efflux into cortical superfusates rose steadily during the period of ischemia and tended to increase even further during the subsequent 40 min of reperfusion. GABA release rose during ischemia and declined during reperfusion, whereas glycine efflux was relatively unchanged during both ischemia and reperfusion. Adenosine levels in cortical superfusates rose rapidly at the onset of ischemia and then declined even though MCA occlusion was continued. Recovery to pre-occlusion levels was rapid following reperfusion. Inosine efflux also increased rapidly, but its decline during reperfusion was slower than that of adenosine.
