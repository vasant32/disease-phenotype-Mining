Cerebral ischemia initiates an inflammatory response in the brain that is associated with the induction of a variety of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1alpha/beta (IL-1alpha/beta) that contributes to stroke injury. Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) resulted in significant increases in TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels. We have previously demonstrated up-regulation of secretory phospholipase A2 IIA (sPLA2 IIA) mRNA and protein expression, increased PLA2 activity, and loss of phosphatidylcholine after 1-h tMCAO and 24-h reperfusion in SHR. Treatment with TNF-alpha antibody or IL-1 receptor antagonist significantly attenuated infarction volume, sPLA2 IIA protein expression, PLA2 activity and significantly restored phosphatidylcholine levels after tMCAO. This suggests that cytokine induction up-regulates sPLA2 IIA protein expression, resulting in altered lipid metabolism that contributes to stroke injury.
