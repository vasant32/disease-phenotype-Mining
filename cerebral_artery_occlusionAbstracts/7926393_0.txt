Ischemic cerebrovascular disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. One common final pathway in neuronal ischemic damage is the uncontrolled influx of calcium into the cell, mediated by voltage dependent channels or activation of the NMDA (N-methyl D-aspartate) receptor. The therapeutic utility of a non-competitive NMDA blocker (MK-801, 2 mg/kg i.p.), to prevent the neuronal ischemic damage in an experimental middle cerebral artery occlusion model has been tested. The drug was administered 10 minutes before (group 3) and one hour after the arterial occlusion (group 4), and the results were compared with a group in which no medicament was utilized (group 2) and a control group (sham operation, group 1). MK-801 reduced significantly the area of infarction in relation to the control group (p < 0.05), mainly if the MK-801 was administered before the occlusion (group 3). These results suggest that MK-801 may be useful for the prevention of the neuronal ischemic damage caused by focal ischemia. However, before recommending its use in humans, all the possible collateral effects must be defined.
