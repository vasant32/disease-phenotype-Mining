Cyclooxygenase (COX) is crucial in inflammation; COX-1 is constitutional, and COX-2 is inducible. In this study, neurological function and infarct volume were evaluated at 24 h after permanent endovascular middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in both COX-1-gene knockout (homozygous or heterozygous) and wide-type mice. Similar infarct volumes and neurological deficits were seen among mice of different genotypes. There was no difference among the groups in arterial blood pressure and regional cerebral blood flow during the first 30 min of ischemia. Our results failed to confirm the harmful effect of losing COX-1 activity due to gene knockout in a permanent endovascular MCAO mouse stroke model.
