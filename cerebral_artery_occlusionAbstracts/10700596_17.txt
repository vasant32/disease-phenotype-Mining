It has been reported that activated neutrophils are involved in the development of cerebral damage induced by ischemia. Activated neutrophils release a lot of mediators including toxic oxygen metabolites, elastase and cytokines which damage brain tissue. Therefore, we investigated roles of neutrophil elastase in the development of cerebral damage using an elastase inhibitor, ONO-5046. The rat middle cerebral artery (MCA) was occluded by a thrombus induced by photochemical reaction between green light and the photosensitizer dye, Rose Bengal. Photochemical reaction causes endothelial injury followed by formation of a platelet and fibrin-rich thrombus at the site of the irradiation. Photochemical reaction is routinely used in our laboratory to produce arterial occlusion in experimental animals. Twenty-four hours after the MCA occlusion, the size of cerebral damage was measured by histochemical technique. Water content in the brain was measured and neuronal deficits were examined 24 h after the MCA occlusion. ONO-5046 was administered at various doses as continuous infusion for 24 h, starting just after the MCA occlusion or from 3 h after. ONO-5046 at doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg/h significantly (p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively) reduced the size of cerebral damage and water content (p<0.05, p<0.01, respectively) in different eight rats. Further, ONO-5046 at a dose of 30 mg/kg/h significantly (p=0.01) improved neuronal deficits. ONO-5046 which was administered starting from 3 h after the MCA occlusion, also reduced the size of cerebral damage. Neutropenia by anti-neutrophil antibody injection significantly (p<0. 01) reduced the size of cerebral damage. Elastase released from activated neutrophils may play a key role in the development of cerebral damage.
