Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor is involved in cholesterol metabolism of CNS as a receptor of apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which plays an important role in regenerative process after brain ischemia. Temporal and spatial changes of LDL receptor were investigated after 90 min of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in relation to those of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and ApoE. In the ischemic core, LDL receptor became positive at 1 d after transient MCAO, which was not double positive for MAP2 or ApoE, and disappeared in 7 and 56 d. In the peri-ischemic area, LDL receptor became observed at 7 d, which peaked at 21 d, most of which were double positive for MAP2. The number of LDL receptor and ApoE double-positive cells increased at 7 d and decreased at 21 d with the shift of LDL receptor immunoreactivity from cytoplasm at 7 d to dendrites at 21 d in the peri-ischemic area. These results suggest that LDL receptor, interacting with ApoE, is profoundly involved in lipid transport of CNS for tissue repair in the peri-ischemic area after brain ischemia.
