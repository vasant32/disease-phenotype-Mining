Previous experimental studies have shown the protective effects of CBX on brain ischemic injures in global and in vitro models of ischemia. However, effects of CBX in temporary model of focal cerebral ischemia are not clear. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of central microinjection of CBX on post-ischemic reperfusion injuries in a temporary model of focal cerebral ischemia. Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced in rats by 60 min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), followed by 23 h reperfusion. CBX was administered into the right ventricle at doses of 1, 12, 25, 50 and/or 100 microg/kg at the beginning of MCAO. Cortical and striatal infarct volumes and motor dysfunctions were assessed 24 h after MCAO. Administration of CBX at doses of 1, 12, 25 and/or 50 microg/kg significantly reduced cortical infarct volumes by 35%, 49%, 41% and 43%, respectively (P<0.001). In addition, CBX only at dose of 25 microg/kg significantly reduced striatal infarct volume and improved neurological dysfunctions (P<0.01). Our findings indicated that central microinjection of CBX has protective effect on against ischemic reperfusion injuries in a transient model of focal cerebral ischemia.
