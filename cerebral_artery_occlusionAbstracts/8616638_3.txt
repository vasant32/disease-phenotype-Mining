We recently reported that the outcome of focal cerebral ischemia induced by intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion may differ depending upon a rat's strain and/or vendor. Sprague-Dawley rats originating from Taconic Laboratories and Charles River Laboratories had infarct volumes several fold larger than Sprague-Dawley rats originating from Simonsen Laboratories. The present study sought to determine whether these differences were restricted to an intraluminal technique or whether strain and vendor dependent differences will also exist in rats subjected to a transcranial method of focal cerebral ischemia. Accordingly, we permanently coagulated the middle cerebral artery via a transcranial approach in Sprague-Dawley rats originating from Simonsen Laboratories and Taconic Laboratories and in Simonsen Laboratories Fischer-344 rats. The cortical infarct volume significantly differed in the following order: Simonsen Laboratories Sprague-Dawley rats < Simonsen Laboratories Fischer-344 rats < Taconic Laboratories Sprague-Dawley rats. The subcortical infarct volume differed statistically in the following order: Simonsen Laboratories Sprague-Dawley rats < Taconic Laboratories Sprague-Dawley rats < Simonsen Laboratories Fischer-344 rats. These results along with our previous findings demonstrate that strain and vendor differences in the outcome of focal cerebral ischemia are independent of the technique applied.
