Heat shock proteins (HSPs) 60 and 10 are stress-inducible mitochondrial matrix proteins that form a chaperonin complex that is important for mitochondrial protein folding and function. The effect of cerebral ischemia on mitochondrial HSPs is unclear. The topographical and chronological patterns of HSP60 and HSP10 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression and induction were investigated in the rat focal cerebral ischemia model. Focal cerebral ischemia was produced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion for 30 or 90 min. Expression of mRNAs was analyzed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and in situ hybridization. RT-PCR analysis showed that both HSP60 and HSP10 mRNA levels increased significantly in the ischemic cortex from 4 to 24 h of reperfusion after 30 min of occlusion. In situ hybridization analysis demonstrated significant induction of both mRNAs in the whole ischemic cortex after 30 min of occlusion and in the dorsomedial border (penumbra) of the ischemic cortex and ipsilateral hippocampus after 90 min of occlusion. Expression patterns and the timing of the induction of both HSP60 and HSP10 mRNAs were identical throughout the experiments. Simultaneous induction of the mRNAs for the mitochondrial chaperonins, HSP60 and HSP10, in various regions in focal cerebral ischemia demonstrates that mitochondrial stress conditions persist concomitantly with cytosolic stress conditions in focal cerebral ischemia.
