Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) induces the dilatation of cerebral blood vessels and increases cerebral blood flow (CBF). CRF receptor antagonists reduce ischaemic damage in the rat. In the present study, the expression of CRF around cerebral vessels has been investigated in the rat. No CRF immunoreactivity was identified around pial or intracerebral vessels in the absence of cerebral ischaemia. Four hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo), intensely CRF-positive blood vessels were evident on the ischaemic cortical surface and in the peri-infarct and infarct zone. Increased CRF immunoreactivity was also detected in swollen axons in subcortical white matter, caudate nucleus and lateral olfactory tract of the ipsilateral hemisphere, consistent with the failure of axonal transport. These data provide morphologic support for a role of CRF in the pathophysiology of cerebral ischaemia.
