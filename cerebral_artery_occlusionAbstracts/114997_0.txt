Previous workers have clearly established that the central core limbic structures of the brain are primarily concerned in the production of amnesia of the axial or mesial type. The blood supply to these structures derives primarily from the posterior cerebral circulation. This was the rationale for Benson's work on 'amnesic stroke' in patients with posterior cerebral artery occlusion. We have extended this concept to show that a similar axial amnesia, as demonstrated by a classical response on Wechsler Memory Scale testing, exists in patients with vertebrobasilar insufficiency. Relative permanency of the amnesic syndrome was demonstrated by repeat testing at may be of assistance in the diagnosis of vertebrobasilar insufficiency.
