Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) can initiate an energy-consuming and inefficient repair cycle following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion by transferring ADP ribose units to nuclear proteins eventually leading to cellular dysfunction and neuronal death. 3-Aminobenzamide (3-AB) is a selective inhibitor of PARP that can significantly reduce brain damage after focal ischemia in rats and displays a low toxicity in vivo. The goals of this study were to determine if inhibiting PARP with 3-AB has a long-term neuroprotective effect and if functional outcome improves in rats following focal ischemia and treatment with 3-AB. Focal ischemia was induced by a 2-h occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), using an intraluminal filament. Motor functions were evaluated from 5 to 28 days after reperfusion in four groups of rats: stroke without treatment; stroke treated with 3-AB at doses of 15 mg/kg, stroke treated with 3-AB at doses of 55 mg/kg; and the non-ischemic control rats. Functional behaviors were tested by a series of motor function tasks (foot placing, parallel bar crossing, rope and ladder climbing), as well as a neurological examination. Infarct volume of stroke brain in the same rat was determined by Nissl staining 28 days after surgery. Comparison of the untreated stroke group (n=11) and the treated stroke groups indicates that impairment of motor function was significantly (P<0.001) reduced by administration of 3-AB at doses of 15 mg/kg (n=9) or 55 mg/kg (n=10). Neurological outcome was also improved significantly (P<0.001). Infarct volume was significantly (P<0.01) reduced in both treated groups. Long-term neuroprotection following ischemia/reperfusion injury to the brain can be obtained by administration of a PARP inhibitor. The motor tests employed in this study can be used as sensitive, objective and reproducible measurements of functional impairment in rats following an ischemic stroke.
