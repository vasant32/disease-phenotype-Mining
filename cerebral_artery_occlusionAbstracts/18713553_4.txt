BACKGROUND: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) research has mainly been focused on the therapeutic effect of psychiatric disorders and Parkinson's disease. A few studies have shown that rTMS might protect against delayed neuronal death induced by transient ischemia, enhance long-term potentiation in ischemic conditions and affect regional brain blood flow and metabolism. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content and microtubule associated protein-2 (MAP-2) expression in rat brain after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)/reperfusion. METHODS: To study the effects of different timecourses of rTMS on ATP content and MAP-2 expression, 90 rats were randomly divided into three groups (30 rats in each group). To study the effects of multiple rTMS parameters on ATP content and MAP-2 expression, the rats in each group were further divided into six subgroups (five rats each). The rats were sacrificed at 1-hour, 24-hour and 48-hour intervals after reperfusion, and the brain tissues were collected for the detection of ATP and MAP-2. RESULTS: rTMS could significantly increase ATP content and MAP-2 expression in the left brain following ischemic insult (P < 0.01) and different rTMS parameters had different effects on the ATP level and the MAP-2 expression in the left striatum. A high-frequency rTMS played an important role in MAP-2 expression and ATP preservation. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that rTMS induced significant increase of ATP content and MAP-2 expression in the injured area of the brain, suggesting that the regulation of both ATP and MAP-2 may be involved in the biological mechanism of the effect of rTMS on neural recovery. Therefore, rTMS may become a potential adjunctive therapy for ischemic cerebrovascular disease.
