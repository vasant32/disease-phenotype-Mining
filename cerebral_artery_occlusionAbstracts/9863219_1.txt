Recent studies have suggested that protein kinase C (PKC) may be involved in the formation of brain edema. In this paper, the effects of two kinds of PKC inhibitors, H-7 and matrine, were examined on the brain edema formation in experimental models. The results showed that pretreatment with H-7 6.25 and 12.5 mg.kg-1 prevented the accumulation of water and certain electrolytes in the unilateral hemisphere of the brain evoked by ligation of a single common carotid artery in Mongolian gerbil; pretreatment with matrine 25 and 50 mg.kg-1 reduced the extent of cerebral edema formation evoked by ligation of a single common carotid artery in gerbil and by middle cerebral artery occlusion in Sprague-Dawley rats. These results present new evidence for the involvement of PKC in the formation of brain edema.
