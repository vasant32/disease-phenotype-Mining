Though the potential use of adenosine as a neuroprotective agent has long been realized, there are currently no adenosine-based therapies for the prevention or treatment of cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury. Prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), an enzyme that has long served as a diagnostic marker for prostate cancer, has been recently demonstrated to exhibit ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity, and dephosphorylate endogenous extracellular AMP to adenosine. We therefore tested the hypothesis that PAP has sustained and potent neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia in the rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion. We found that hPAP produced significant neuroprotection against focal cerebral ischemia, as evident from significant reduction in cerebral infarction and neurological deficits. The therapeutic time window for hPAP in rat focal cerebral ischemia model was limited from 6 h before ischemia to 1.5 h after reperfusion. The present study suggested that PAP is a potential candidate for the prevention and treatment of cerebral ischemic injury, especially during perioperative period.
