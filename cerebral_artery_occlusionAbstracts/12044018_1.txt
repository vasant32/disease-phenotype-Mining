It has been reported that interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta ) play a key role in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia. Acupuncture is an effective traditional medical therapy in China. The aim of present study was to evaluate the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on IL-1beta mRNA expression after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. Using in situ hybridization technique, it was found that in the MCAO group the expression of IL-1beta mRNA was significantly increased at 2h, 6h, 12h after reperfusion in cerebral ischemic cortex compared with normal group. In EA+ MCAO group the expression of IL-1beta mRNA was significantly decreased at 2h, 6h and 12h in ischemic cortex compared with MCAO group. The results indicated that EA might decrease the IL-1beta protein expression by reducing the IL-beta mRNA expression in ischemic cortex.
