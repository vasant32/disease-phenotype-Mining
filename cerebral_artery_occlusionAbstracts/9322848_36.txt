The authors examined the effect of delayed high-concentration albumin therapy on ischemic injury in a highly reproducible model of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 270 to 320 g were anesthetized with halothane and subjected to 120 minutes of temporary MCA occlusion induced by means of a poly-L-lysine-coated intraluminal nylon suture inserted retrograde via the external carotid artery into the internal carotid artery and MCA. The agent (20% human serum albumin [HSA]) or control solution (sodium chloride 0.9%) was administered intravenously at a dosage of 1% of body weight immediately after suture removal following a 2-hour period of MCA occlusion. The animals' neurological status was evaluated during MCA occlusion (at 60 minutes) and daily for 3 days thereafter. The brains were perfusion-fixed, and infarct volumes and brain edema were determined. The HSA significantly improved the neurological score compared with saline at 24 hours after MCA occlusion. The rats treated with HSA also had significantly reduced total infarct volume (by 34%) and brain edema (by 81%) compared with saline-treated rats. There was a strong correlation between hematocrit level and brain edema (p < 0.01), and between total infarct volume or brain edema and neurological score at 24, 48, and 72 hours postinjury (p < 0.0002). These results strongly support the beneficial effect of delayed albumin therapy in transient focal ischemia and indicate its possible usefulness in treating patients with acute ischemic stroke.
