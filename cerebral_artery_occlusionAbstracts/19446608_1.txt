The cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury remains a major medical problem due to the lack of effective treatment. The mechanism of brain injury is still unknown. The defensive and offensive factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) may play important roles. So far, only individual factors were reported. What are the relationships among them in brain ischemia-reperfusion injury remains obscure. The present study is to investigate simultaneously the expression of PDGF-BB, 5-LO, AQP-4 and IGF-1 in middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) in rats. We found that 5-LO and IGF-1 reached the peak level at 24h after reperfusion, AQP-4 at 72 h and PDGF-BB at 7 days. With these results we inferred that both defensive factors, such as PDGF-BB, AQP-4 and IGF-1, and offensive factor, like 5-LO, play some roles in the ischemia-reperfusion injury.
