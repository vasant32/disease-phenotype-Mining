Thioredoxin (TRX) is a small, multifunctional protein with a redox-active site and multiple biological functions that include reducing activity for reactive oxygen intermediates. We assayed TRX and TRX mRNA by immunohistochemical methods and hybridization experiments in the rat brain after middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. During ischemia, the immunoreactivity for TRX decreased; it disappeared after MCA occlusion in the ischemic regions. It rapidly decreased and nearly disappeared at 4 and 16 hours after MCA occlusion in the lateral striatum and frontoparietal cortex, respectively. On the other hand, in the perifocal ischemic region, the penumbra, TRX immunoreactivity began to increase 4 hours after MCA occlusion and continued to increase until 24 hours after occlusion. In hybridization experiments, TRX mRNA decreased and nearly disappeared 4 hours after MCA occlusion in the lateral striatum. In the frontoparietal cortex, it decreased until 24 hours after MCA occlusion. In the perifocal ischemic region, TRX mRNA began to increase 4 hours after MCA occlusion and continued to increase until 24 hours. Northern blot analysis showed that total TRX mRNA in the operated hemispheres was induced from 8 hours and increased until 24 hours after the surgical procedures. We previously reported that recombinant TRX promotes the in vitro survival of primary cultured neurons. We now suggest that TRX in the penumbra has neuroprotective functions and that decreased levels of TRX in the ischemic core modify neuronal damage during focal brain ischemia.
