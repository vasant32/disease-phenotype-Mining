Previous studies have demonstrated that a natural coumarin compound esculetin (Esc) possesses antioxidant, anti-tumor, and anti-inflammation activities and rescues cultured primary neurons from NMDA toxicity. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of Esc on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in a middle cerebral artery occlusion model in mice. Esc (20 Î¼g) was administered intracerebroventricularly at 30 min before ischemia. We found that Esc significantly reduced infarct volume and decreased neurological deficit scores after 75 min of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion. Post-treatment of Esc still provided neuroprotection even when Esc was administered after 4 h of reperfusion. Our data also indicated that intraperitoneal administration of Esc showed protective effects on cerebral I/R injury in a dose-dependent manner. We further explored the protective mechanisms of Esc on cerebral I/R injury and found that Esc decreased cleaved caspase 3 level, a marker of apoptosis. Finally, our data demonstrated that Esc exerted its anti-apoptotic activity by up-regulating the expression of Bcl-2 and down-regulating the expression of Bax, two apoptosis-related proteins. Because of its clinical use as an anticoagulant and its safety profile, Esc may have a therapeutic potential for the treatment of stroke in the future clinical trials.
