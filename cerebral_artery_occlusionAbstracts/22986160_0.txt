Spreading depolarizations are accompanied by transient changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF). In a post hoc analysis of previously studied control rats we analyzed CBF time courses after middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat in order to test whether intra-ischemic flow, reperfusion, and different parameters of peri-infarct flow transients (PIFTs) (amplitude, number) can predict outcome. Sprague-Dawley rats anesthetized with either halothane (n=23) or isoflurane (n=32) underwent 90-min filament occlusion of the middle cerebral artery followed by 72 h of reperfusion. The infarct size was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. Relative CBF changes were monitored by laser Doppler flowmetry at 4-5 mm lateral, and 1-2mm posterior to Bregma. An additional filament occlusion study (n=12) was performed to validate that PIFTs were coupled to direct current shifts of spreading depolarization. The PIFT-direct current shift study revealed that every PIFT was associated with a negative direct current shift typical of spreading depolarization. Post-hoc analysis showed that the number of PIFTs, especially with the combination of intra-ischemic level of flow, can predict the development of cortical infarcts. These findings show that PIFTs can serve as an early biomarker in predicting outcome in preclinical animal studies.
