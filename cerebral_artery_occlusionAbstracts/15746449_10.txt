BACKGROUND: Patients with isolated middle cerebral artery (MCA) and tandem MCA/internal carotid artery (ICA) obstruction have similar presenting symptoms and stroke severity. We aimed to investigate early recanalization of MCA and clinical outcomes in patients with tandem ICA/MCA obstructions and isolated MCA occlusion. METHODS: Patients with MCA occlusion on pretreatment transcranial Doppler were treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator. ICA lesions were detected with carotid duplex. Early neurological improvement (ENI) was defined by reduction of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) > or =10 points or total NIHSS < or =3 points. Good outcome at 3 months was a modified Rankin score of < or =2. RESULTS: Among 104 patients, 31% had tandem lesions and 69% had isolated MCA occlusions. Complete recanalization rate was 39% in isolated MCA occlusion group and 9% in tandem group (P=0.002). ENI at 24 hours occurred in 46% of the isolated MCA occlusion group and in 25% of the tandem group (P=0.045). Good outcome was achieved by 30% and 39% respective patients (NS). CONCLUSIONS: The tandem lesion group showed lower early recanalization rate and ENI rate than the isolated MCA occlusion group. Despite this, good outcomes were similar in both groups.
