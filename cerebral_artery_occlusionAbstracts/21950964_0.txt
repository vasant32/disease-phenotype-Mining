Focal cerebral cortical infarction after distal middle cerebral artery occlusion causes β-amyloid deposition and secondary neuronal degeneration in the ipsilateral ventroposterior nucleus of the thalamus. Several studies suggest that autophagy is an active pathway for β-amyloid peptide generation. This study aimed to investigate the role of autophagy in thalamic β-amyloid deposition and neuronal degeneration after cerebral cortical infarction in hypertensive rats. At 7 and 14days after middle cerebral artery occlusion, neuronal death and β-amyloid deposits were evident in the ipsilateral ventroposterior nucleus, and the activity of β-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme 1, required for β-amyloid peptide generation, was elevated in the thalamus. In correlation, both the number of cells showing punctate microtubule-associated protein 1A light chain 3 fluorescence and levels of light chain 3-II protein, an autophagosome marker, were markedly increased. Notably, most of the cells that over-expressed β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 displayed punctate light chain 3 staining. Furthermore, the inhibition of autophagy with 3-methyladenine significantly reduced the thalamic neuronal damage, β-amyloid deposits, and β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 activity. These results suggest that autophagosomes accumulate within thalamic cells after cerebral cortical infarction, which is associated with thalamic β-amyloid deposition and secondary neuronal degeneration via elevation of β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 level.
