Filgratism (granulocyte colony stimulating factor, G-CSF)-mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) have replaced bone marrow (BM) as a preferred source of autologous stem cells, in light of the faster hematologic recovery and lesser supportive care requirement exhibited by PBPC transplants. Other hematopoietic stem cells, like the human umbilical cord blood-derived stem cells (hUCBs), and nonhematopoietic stem cells have been shown to improve motor function in rodent models of injury and degenerative disease. In the present study we transplanted either G-CSF-mobilized PBPCs or hUCBs in rats 24 h after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and assessed their behavioral abnormalities in spontaneous activity and spontaneous motor asymmetry. In both transplanted groups of rats we observed a significant reduction of the stroke-induced hyperactivity compared with nontransplanted, stroked animals. In addition, transplantation of G-CSF PBPC and hUCB cells prevented the development of extensive motor asymmetry. Our findings raise the possibility that PBPCs could provide a novel transplantation therapy to treat stroke.
