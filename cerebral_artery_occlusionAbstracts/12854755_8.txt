OBJECT: The authors previously showed that spinal cord stimulation (SCS) increases cerebral blood flow in rats, indicating that this technique may be useful in the treatment of focal cerebral ischemia. In the present study, the neuroprotective potential of SCS in the setting of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was investigated. METHODS: The authors induced permanent, focal cerebral ischemia by using either suture-induced occlusion or direct division of the MCA in Sprague-Dawley rats. Electrical stimulation of the cervical spinal cord was performed during cerebral ischemia. Cerebral blood flow was assessed using both laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) and quantitative radiotracer analysis. Stroke volumes were analyzed after 6 hours of ischemia. Spinal cord stimulation resulted in a 52.7 +/- 13.3% increase in LDF values (nine animals). Following MCAO, LDF values decreased by 64.1 +/- 3.6% from baseline values (10 animals). Spinal cord stimulation subsequently increased LDF values to 30.9 +/- 13.5% below original baseline values. These findings were corroborated using radiotracer studies. Spinal cord stimulation in the setting of transcranial MCAO significantly reduced stroke volumes as well (from 203 +/- 33 mm3 [control] to 32 +/- 8 mm3 [MCAO plus SCS], seven animals in each group, p < 0.001). Similarly, after suture-induced MCAO, SCS reduced stroke volumes (from 307 +/- 29 mm3 [control] to 78 +/- 22 mm3 [MCAO plus SCS], 10 animals in each group, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A strategy of performing SCS for the prevention of critical ischemia is feasible and may have the potential for the treatment and prevention of stroke.
