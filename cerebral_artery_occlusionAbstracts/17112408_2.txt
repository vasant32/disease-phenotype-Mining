AIM: To determine whether cysteinyl leukotriene receptors (CysLT1 and CysLT2) are upregulated in acute neuronal injury after focal cerebral ischemia in mice, and to confirm CysLT1 receptor localization. METHODS: After permanent focal cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), neurological deficits and neuron loss were determined at various time points within 48 h. The mRNA expressions of CysLT1 and CysLT2 receptors in the brain were analyzed by RT-PCR. CysLT1 receptor localization was detected by double immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Neurological deficits and neuron loss were found 6, 24 and 48 h after MCAO. The mRNA expressions of both CysLT1 and CysLT2 receptors were upregulated in the ischemic hemisphere 1, 24, and 48 h after MCAO with peaks at 24 h. The CysLT1 receptor was selectively localized in neurons 24 h after MCAO. CONCLUSION: CysLT1 and CysLT2 receptors are upregulated in acute neuronal injury after focal cerebral ischemia, and the CysLT1 receptor is localized in neurons after ischemia.
