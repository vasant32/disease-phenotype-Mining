OBJECTIVE: Studying the protective effect of dachuanxiongwan (DCXW) on the rats with focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. METHODS: The ischemia and reperfusion model was established by blocking the rat's middle cerebral artery with a pre-set nylon thread and removing it from the internal carotid artery 2 hours after occlusion. 20 healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) were randomly divided into two groups: Group A, transient ischemia, for control; Group B, transient ischemia treated with DCXW via gavage, 4.13 g/kg x d, twice a day for 3 days, while group A being given the same volume of saline. Seventy-two hours after reperfusion, the neurological function of all rats was evaluated according to Longa, and the rats were sacrificed. All the samples of cerebrum were processed and embedded in paraffin and cut into sections. The sections were stained with Hematoxylin & Eosin to measure the infarction volume and evaluate the effects of DCXW. RESULTS: The grade of neurological function of the treatment group (1.5+/-0.71) was lower than that of the control group (2.3+/-0.82), there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P=0.032); the infarction volume of the treatment group was smaller than that of the control group, there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P=0.000). CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that DCXW has a protective effect on the cerebrum undergoing ischemia and reperfusion.
