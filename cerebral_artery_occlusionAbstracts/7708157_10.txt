Cysticercosis is the most common parasitic disease affecting the central nervous system. Stroke is a recognized complication of neurocysticercosis, occurring in 2 to 12% of cases, mostly in the form of small lacunar infarcts. We report a case of hemiparesis and aphasia in a 51-year-old Hispanic woman, which was secondary to complete occlusion of the left internal carotid and bilateral anterior cerebral arteries. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the presence of enhancing subarachnoid material surrounding these occluded cerebral arteries, providing antemortem, noninvasive documentation of the inflammatory meningeal cysticercotic reaction that was presumably responsible for the occlusive arteritis causing the cerebral infarction. This represents the third reported case of internal carotid artery occlusion and the first reported case of anterior cerebral artery occlusion secondary to neurocysticercosis.
