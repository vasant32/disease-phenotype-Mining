Melatonin is a potent antioxidant and free radical scavenger. Previously, we showed that a single injection of melatonin before ischemia significantly reduced the infarct volume in both permanent and 3-hr middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat stroke models. Nitric oxide (NO) and other free radicals play an important role in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia, and they have been postulated to mediate the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) during ischemia. In this study, we evaluated the influence of melatonin, given at 30 min before MCAO, on brain NO concentration and BBB breakdown. Brain NO concentration was measured at 15 min of MCAO using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. BBB breakdown at 3 hr of reperfusion following 3 hr of MCAO was assessed using Evans blue extravasation. The relative brain NO concentration was increased to 141.69 +/- 9.71% (mean +/- S.E.M.; n = 9) at 15 min of MCAO. Treatment with melatonin at 1.5, 5, or 50 mg/kg significantly reduced the brain NO concentration to 104.20 +/- 11.20% (n = 8), 55.67 +/- 5.58% (n = 11), and 104.86 +/- 12.56% (n = 9), respectively. Melatonin at 5 mg/kg did not affect Evans blue extravasation. Our results suggest that a single injection of melatonin protects against focal cerebral ischemia partly via inhibition of ischemia-induced NO production and that this regimen does not prevent BBB breakdown following ischemia-reperfusion.
