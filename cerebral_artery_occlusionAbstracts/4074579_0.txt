Ischemic brain injury affects the content and metabolism of brain monomines. Our aim was to know the time course of changes in regional cerebral catecholamines during focal cerebral ischemia, and whether focal cerebral ischemia may affect the metabolism of catecholamines in distant area of the brain. Methods Fifty-five rats were subjected to occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) on the olfactory tract, under halothane anesthesia. Fourteen animals were sham-operated group. Animals were decapitated at 1/2, 1,2,3,6,12 and 24 hours post-occlusion (PO), respectively. The brains were removed, and the brain structures dissected out include bilateral corpus striatum, cerebral cortex (MCA territory) and cerebellar hemisphere. Catecholamines were extracted by alumina procedure, and determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Results Dopamine (DA) contents, in ipsilateral corpus striatum and cerebral cortex to the ischemia, decreased at 1 hour PO, and reached, at 6 hours PO, to 40% of control value in corpus striatum and 30% in cerebral cortex, respectively. After 6 hours PO, DA remained low. Norepinephrine (NE) content in the ipsilateral corpus striatum gradually reduced and reached to 60% of control value at 24 hours PO. NE in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex decreased to 50% of control at 1 hour PO, and thereafter remained reduced. In the contralateral corpus striatum and cerebral cortex, either DA or NE showed no significant changes, except 1/2 hour PO. NE contents in bilateral cerebral cortex showed a transient increase at 1/2 hour PO. Cerebellar NE content, bilaterally, reduced slowly to 70% of control at 24 hours PO.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
