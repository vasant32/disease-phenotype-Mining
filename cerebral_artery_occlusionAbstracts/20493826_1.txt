Membrane rafts, rich in sphingolipids and cholesterol, are membrane microdomains important in neuronal domain-specific signaling events such as during axonal outgrowth and neuronal death. The present study seeks to determine the spatiotemporal association of several axonal guidance signaling molecules with membrane rafts. These molecules are Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), Fer Kinase, and collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs), which are known to have important functions in axonal outgrowth and neuronal death caused by cerebral ischemia. Mice were subjected to sham or a 1h unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by a time course of reperfusion up to 24h. Brain cortices were separated and membrane rafts were extracted based on their insolubility in Triton X-100 and separation by sucrose gradient fractionation. We demonstrate the early and transient induction of NRP-1 and CRMP-2 in membrane rafts in both ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres, in contrast to an early, but sustained elevation of Fer kinase and other CRMPs (1, 3, 4, 5) in response to unilateral MCAO. The fact that NRP1/Fer kinase/CRMP-2 co-localize in membrane rafts early during ischemic injury suggests that the membrane rafts may form a scaffold to support and initiate NRP1/Fer/CRMP-2-mediated signal transduction in neuronal damage response during ischemia-reperfusion. Further understanding of the time-specific and membrane domain-specific protein-protein interaction may lead to the identification of therapeutic targets for stroke.
