A new approach is presented for rapid and continuous monitoring of cerebral perfusion which is based upon line-scan MR column imaging with arterial spin tagging (AST) of endogenous water. Spin tagging of arterial water protons is accomplished using adiabatic fast passage inversion, followed by acquisition of the perfusion sensitive MR signal from a column placed at the desired level through the brain using line scan localization techniques. A perfusion sensitive line scan is followed by a non-perfusion sensitive line scan, and perfusion is calculated pixel-by-pixel from the intensity difference of the two lines. Continuous perfusion measurements are reported with temporal resolution of 10 s in pixels of volume 0.027 cm3 or less. Examples of the methodology are given during hypercapnic challenge induced with carbon dioxide, and during an ischemic event induced by reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion. The method is also used to characterize the signal response as a function of arterial inversion time and post inversion acquisition delay. These methods permit rapid and continuous monitoring of cerebral perfusion with high spatial resolution, and can be interleaved with MR measurements of diffusion and T1 to follow the progression of cerebral events during physiological or pharmacological intervention.
