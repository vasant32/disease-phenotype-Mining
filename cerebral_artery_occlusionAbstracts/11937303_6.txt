In a rat endovascular middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) stroke model, we previously showed that intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of neuropeptide Y (NPY) or an Y1 receptor agonist, [Leu(31),Pro(34)]-NPY, increased the infarct volume, that an Y1 receptor antagonist, BIBP3226, reduced the infarct volume, and that an Y2 receptor agonist, NPY3-36, had no effect. In this study, we used electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to measure nitric oxide (NO) and examined how ICV administration of NPY or its receptor analogs would modulate the brain NO level between the bregma levels +2 and -4 mm during MCAO, since excessive NO mediates ischemic damage. The relative brain NO concentration was increased to 131.94 +/- 7.99% (mean +/- SEM; n = 8) at 15 min of MCAO. NPY treatment further increased the relative brain NO concentration to 250.94 +/- 50.48% (n = 8), whereas BIBP3226 significantly reduced the brain NO concentration to 69.63 +/- 8.84% (n = 8). [Leu(31),Pro(34)]-NPY (137.61 +/- 14.54%; n = 7) or NPY3-36 (129.23 +/- 21.77%; n = 8) did not affect the brain NO concentration at 15 min of MCAO. Our results suggest that the NPY-Y1 receptor activation mediates ischemic injury via NO overproduction and that inhibition of the Y1 receptor may confer protection via suppression of excessive NO production during ischemia.
