Stroke is a very uncommon complication of hydatic disease. The case of a pediatric patient who suffered cerebral infarction due to the occlussion of the right middle cerebral artery, and who subsequently developed multiple hydatic cysts in the territory of the occluded vessel, is presented. Even though the diagnostic tests aimed to detect a primary focus of the disease were negative, the existing data support the possibility of a cardiac embolic origin.
