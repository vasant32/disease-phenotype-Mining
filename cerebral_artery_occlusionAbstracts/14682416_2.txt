OBJECTIVE: In view of the potentially beneficial effects of ultrasound on fibrinolysis, we aimed to study possible drawbacks of low-energy ultrasound on nonperfused and perfused brain tissue. METHODS: A model of transient focal ischemia in anesthetized rats was used. Rats were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: the first exposed to ultrasound, the second a control of the ultrasound group, and the third a method control group. In each group, the right middle cerebral artery was occluded for 1.5 hours, during which time the rats in the ultrasound group were exposed to 1 hour of pulsed ultrasound (1 MHz; spatial-average temporal-average intensity, 0.1 W/cm2 at a duty cycle of 10%). The occlusion period was followed by a 24-hour recirculation period, after which the brains were excised and evaluated. RESULTS: Ultrasound did not affect the volume of ischemic damage in nonperfused brain tissue or add ischemic damage to perfused brain tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Under these experimental conditions, ultrasound does not cause additional ischemic damage to the rat brain during middle cerebral artery occlusion.
