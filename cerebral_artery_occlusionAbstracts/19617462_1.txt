Cerebral artery occlusion in childhood, particularly in the posterior circulation, is a rare neurological complication of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. A genetic defect in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene could result in hyperhomocysteinemia and increased risk of stroke. We report a patient with posterior cerebral artery occlusion after Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection associated with a homozygous, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene mutant type.
