A novel rat chemokine, termed ST38, was identified through its upregulation in ischemic brain tissue using a biased differential display technique targeting mRNAs with regulatory AUUUA-motifs typically found in transcripts of cytokine and immediate early genes. ST38 transcripts were transiently induced in ischemic cortex between 4 and 24 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion. ST38 is a member of the CC chemokine family, closely related to human Exodus-1. The gene of the mouse ST38 homologue was mapped to the central region of chromosome 1. In experimental autoimmune panencephalomyelitis ST38 expression correlated with the onset of inflammation and was significantly reduced by TNF-neutralization in vivo. Inflammatory stimuli induce ST38 transcription in astrocyte, microglia and macrophage cultures. These findings suggest a role of ST38 in the control of neuroinflammatory tissue responses.
