Neuroprotective effect of lipoxin A(4) methyl ester (LXA(4) ME) was tested in a rat model of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion. LXA(4) ME was administrated through intracerebroventricular injection immediately after middle cerebral artery was occluded. Administration of LXA(4) ME ameliorated neurological deficit, reduced infarct volume, attenuated histological damage, and decreased number of apoptotic neuron induced by ischemic insult. These neuroprotective effects of LXA(4) ME were associated with inhibition of neutrophil infiltration, lipid peroxidation, and astrocyte activation. In addition, LXA(4) ME also attenuated proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-1beta) production. These data suggest that LXA(4) ME protects neuron against permanent cerebral ischemia by inhibiting inflammatory responses.
