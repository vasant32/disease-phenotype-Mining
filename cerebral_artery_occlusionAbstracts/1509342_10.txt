During cellular ischemia and death, many changes occur in the cell. These include the build-up of purines and lipid peroxidation. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of allopurinol, which blocks purine breakdown, and deferoxamine, which inhibits lipid peroxidation, as cytoprotective agents. Rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion and were treated with high or low doses of allopurinol or high or low doses of deferoxamine, with normal saline used as a control. Treatments were given 1 hour before, 1 hour after, or 5 hours after occlusion. The outcome was based on neurological status and infarct size. Both infarct size and neurological status were found to be improved in all treatment groups when compared to controls. This study suggests that the use of these agents prevents cellular damage during ischemia.
