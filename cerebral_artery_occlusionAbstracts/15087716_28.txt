The goal of the present study was to test the impact of administration time of the angiotensin II type 1-receptor blocker candesartan on cerebral blood flow (CBF), infarct size, and neuroscore in transient cerebral ischemia. Therefore, 1-hour middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was followed by reperfusion. Rats received 0.5-mg/kg candesartan intravenously 2 hours before MCAO (pretreatment), 24 hours after MCAO, every 24 hours after MCAO, or 2 hours before and every 24 hours after MCAO. Infarct size (mm3) and a neuroscore at day 7 were compared with controls. CBF was quantified by radiolabeled microspheres and laser-Doppler flowmetry. Compared with controls (95 +/- 8), infarct size in candesartan-treated groups was smaller (59 +/- 5, 68 +/- 10, 28 +/- 3, and 15 +/- 3, respectively; P<0.05). Although there was no difference in neuroscore between pretreatment and controls (1.55 +/- 0.18, 1.80 +/- 0.13), other treatment regimens resulted in improved neuroscores (1.33 +/- 0.16, 1.11 +/- 0.11, 0.73 +/- 0.15; P<0.05). CBF in pretreated animals at 0.5 hours after MCAO was significantly higher than in controls (0.58 +/- 0.09 mL x g(-1) x min(-1) and 44% +/- 7% of baseline compared with 0.49 +/- 0.06 mL x g(-1) x min(-1) and 37% +/- 6%, microspheres and laser-Doppler flowmetry; P<0.05). Thus, candesartan reduces infarct size even if administered only during reperfusion. Apart from pretreatment, other treatment regimens result in significantly improved neuroscores. In the acute phase of cerebral ischemia, candesartan increases CBF.
