The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of cornel iridoid glycoside (CIG), an ingredient extracted from a traditional Chinese herb Cornus officinalis, on neurological function and neurogenesis after ischemic stroke. CIG was intragastrically administered to rats in doses of 20, 60 and 180 mg/kg/day, starting 3 h after the onset of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The behavioral test was performed by using the modified neurological severity score (mNSS). Rats were sacrificed 7, 14, or 28 days after ischemia occurred. Neurogenesis and angiogenesis were detected by using immunofluorescence staining. The messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor Flk-1 was measured by RT-PCR, and the protein expression of VEGF was determined by Western blotting analysis. The treatment with CIG at the doses of 60 and 180 mg/kg/day significantly improved neurological function, and increased the number of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells and nestin-positive cells in the subventricular zone of rats 7, 14 and 28 days after ischemia. The number of newly mature neurons and blood vessels in striatum, as indicated by BrdU/NeuN and vWF immunoreactivity, respectively, was also increased in CIG-treated rats 28 days after stroke. CIG treatment obviously enhanced the mRNA expression of VEGF and its receptor Flk-1 and the protein expression of VEGF 7 and 28 days after ischemia. The results indicated that CIG promoted neurogenesis and angiogenesis and improved neurological function after ischemia in rats, and the mechanism might be related to CIG's increasing VEGF and Flk-1 in the brain.
