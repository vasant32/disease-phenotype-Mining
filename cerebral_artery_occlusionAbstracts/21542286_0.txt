The probable mechanism of the reduction of rat cerebral ischemic-reperfusion injury by propyl gallate was studied. Intraluminal suture middle cerebral artery occlusion model of rat was employed. Propyl gallate was injected immediately after the ischemia was happened. The activity of NF-kappaB, and the expression of COX-2 and HSP70 on the peripheral ischemia were determined by Western blotting. The expression of TNF-alpha was determined by ELISA assay. RT-PCR and immunofluorescence staining were employed to detect the transcription and expression of TLR-4. Results showed that propyl gallate could inhibit the activity of NF-kappaB in the peripheral ischemia, and reduce the expression of COX-2 and TNF-alpha. As the upstream of NF-kappaB, the transcription and expression of TLR-4 decreased, as well as HSP70, the endogenic ligand of TLR-4. As an antioxidant, propyl gallate could reduce the cerebral ischemic-reperfusion injury through inhibiting the activity of NF-kappaB and decreasing the COX-2 and TNF-alpha in the peripheral ischemia. It also could influence HSP70 and TLR-4.
