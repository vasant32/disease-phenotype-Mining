EGb 761 is an extract of Gingko biloba that is neuroprotective against focal cerebral ischemic injury. PEA-15 (phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes 15) modulates cell proliferation and apoptosis. In this study, we investigated whether EGb 761 regulates the expression of PEA-15 and two phosphorylated forms of PEA-15 (Ser 104 and Ser 116) in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced injury. Adult male rats were treated with vehicle or EGb 761 (100 mg/kg) prior to MCAO and cerebral cortices were collected 24 h after MCAO. A reduction in expression of PEA-15 and its phosphorylated forms induced by MCAO injury was detected using a proteomic approach. EGb 761 pretreatment prevented the ischemic injury-induced decrease in PEA-15 expression. Western blot analysis demonstrated that EGb 761 attenuates the injury-induced reduction in PEA-15, phospho-PEA-15 (Ser 104), phospho-PEA-15 (Ser 116). Phosphorylation of PEA-15 influences its anti-apoptotic function; a decrease in PEA-15 phosphorylation induces apoptotic cell death. The maintenance of PEA-15 phosphorylation by EGb 761 pretreatment during cerebral ischemic injury indicates that EGb 761 is a neuroprotective against cerebral ischemic injury.
