Following occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery in the rat, marked atrophy was observed in the ipsilateral substantia nigra in and after the second week. The mechanism of this neuropathological change in the substantia nigra, which is remote from the site of infarction, may be explained by transsynaptic, neurotransmitter-mediated disinhibition as a result of infarction of the striatum.
