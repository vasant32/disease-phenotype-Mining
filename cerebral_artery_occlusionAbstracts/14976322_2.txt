BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the correlation between appearance of angiographic early venous filling during intra-arterial reperfusion therapy and posttherapeutic hemorrhagic complications. METHODS: For the past 7 years, 104 patients prospectively underwent superselective local angiography via a microcatheter before and during intra-arterial reperfusion therapy for acute middle cerebral artery occlusion to evaluate the presence or absence of early venous filling. In principle, reperfusion therapy was discontinued just after appearance of early venous filling for fear of hemorrhage. There were 2 types of early venous filling: early filling of the thalamostriate vein from the lenticulostriate arteries and that of the cortical vein from the cortical arteries. RESULTS: Among these 104 patients, 31 (29.8%) had early venous filling: 19 had early filling of the thalamostriate vein, and the other 12 had early filling of the cortical vein. Eight of the 19 patients (42.1%) and 2 of the 12 patients (16.7%) had massive hematoma with neurological worsening, whereas only 1 of the 73 patients (1.4%) without early venous filling had massive hematoma. There was a significant correlation between early venous filling and massive hematoma in both the deep (P<0.0001) and superficial (P=0.0019) middle cerebral artery territories. The sensitivity and specificity of the presence of early venous filling as an indicator of parenchymal hematoma were 71% and 83%, respectively. None of the 31 ischemic areas with early venous filling could escape cerebral infarction. CONCLUSIONS: Appearance of early venous filling may indicate irreversible brain damage and may be a predictive sign for parenchymal hematoma.
