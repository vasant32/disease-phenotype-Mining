Although the role of an adhesion molecule such as P-selectin may be important in the pathogenesis of stroke, temporal, spatial, and cellular profiles of the expression of such a protein has not been fully studied in the case of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion and reperfusion in rat brain. Change in expression of immunoreactive P-selectin was examined in rat brain after transient MCA occlusion (MCAO) in comparison to that of permanent occlusion with an anti-P-selectin monoclonal antibody. Western blot analyses were performed to ensure the selective detection of immunoreactive P-selectin protein with the monoclonal antibody using brain homogenates before and after MCAO. Temporal, spacial, and cellular changes of P-selectin expressions were evaluated with rat brain sections at 2, 8h, 1 and 3 days of permanent MCAO, and at 2, 8h, 1, 3 and 7 days of reperfusion after 1 h of transient MCAO. Western blot showed a single band with a molecular weight of 140 kDa for both cases with permanent occlusion and reperfusion. P-selectin immunoreactivity was not normally present in rat brain sections. However, it was expressed mainly in the post-capillary venules of the cerebral cortex and caudate in the MCA territory with a peak at 2-8h after permanent occlusion and at 8h to 1 day after the reperfusion. The expression was diminished by 1 day of permanent occlusion and 3 days of reperfusion. The maximum staining in the case of permanent MCAO was stronger than the case with reperfusion. However, spacial distribution of the staining was similar in the cerebral cortex and caudate between the cases with permanent of transient MCAO. These results suggest a different temporal but similar spacial and cellular expression of P-selection immunoreactivity between permanent occlusion and reperfusion of MCA in rat brain.
