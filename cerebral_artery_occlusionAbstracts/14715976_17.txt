BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) is an attractive procedure that has been used frequently in cerebral ischemia. However, depending on the model of cerebral ischemia and HBO protocol, different and conflicting results were obtained in the past. This study was undertaken to reevaluate the effects of single administration of HBO in 2 models of acute cerebral ischemia: transient or permanent focal ischemia in rats. A comparison of the 2 ischemia models was undertaken to search for a putative therapeutic window. METHODS: The intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion model (MCAO) was used. The effect of single HBO therapy (3 atm absolute, 60 minutes) on transient or permanent focal ischemia, when applied at different times (3, 6, or 12 hours) after MCAO, was investigated; infarct volume and neurological deficits were assessed at 24 hours and up to 7 days. RESULTS: HBO had neuroprotective effects on transient MCAO when HBO was initiated within the first 6 hours, while it aggravated the ischemic injury histologically and clinically when initiated 12 hours after MCAO. In permanent MCAO, HBO did not reduce tissue damage regardless of the timing of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: HBO is highly efficient in reducing infarct volume and improving neurobehavioral outcome in transient MCAO within the first 6 hours. HBO at later time points (>or=12 hours) is harmful by increasing infarct volume. In permanent MCAO, HBO failed to improve infarct volume and clinical outcome.
