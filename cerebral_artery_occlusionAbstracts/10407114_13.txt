In an attempt to elucidate whether glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) receptors are induced after ischemic brain injury, possible expression of immunoreactive GDNF receptor-alpha1 (GFRalpha-1) and c-ret (RET) was examined at 3, 8, or 24 h after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. Immunohistochemical study showed that both GFRalpha-1 and RET staining cells which were not detected in sham control brain, were present in the ipsilateral cortex and caudate at 3 to 8 h after permanent MCAO, and then decreased but remained to some extent at 24 h. Positive cells for both GDNF receptors were predominantly in cortical neurons of ischemic penumbral area. Western blot analysis confirmed the induction of those receptors after permanent MCAO. This rapid induction of GFRalpha-1 and RET, which correlates with the similar induction of GDNF under these conditions, may play a role in the early response to ischemic brain injury.
