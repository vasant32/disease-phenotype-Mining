BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Calcitonin gene-related peptide is an endogenous vasodilating neuropeptide with a dense concentration in the trigeminocerebrovascular system. It is hypothesized that depletion of this peptide contributes to delayed cerebral ischemia after subarachnoid hemorrhage and that an exogenous supply of calcitonin gene-related peptide will augment ischemic cerebral blood flow and reduce neuronal injury. METHODS: In this study we have investigated the effect of an intravenous infusion of calcitonin gene-related peptide (100 ng/kg per minute), started 1 hour before and continued throughout 4 hours of focal cerebral ischemia, on cerebral blood flow and the volume of brain injury in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion. RESULTS: Calcitonin gene-related peptide produces a significant improvement in ischemic cerebral blood flow (32 +/- 2 compared with 13 +/- 2 mL/100 g per minute in the controls; t = 6.92, P < .0001) with a concomitant reduction in the volume of ischemic brain injury (102 +/- 22 compared with 234 +/- 19 mm3; t = 4.47, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings lend support for the potential use of this peptide in the prophylactic treatment of delayed cerebral ischemia after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
