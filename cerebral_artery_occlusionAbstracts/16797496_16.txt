Both prostaglandin A(1) (PGA(1)) and lithium have been reported to protect neurons against excitotoxic and ischemic injury. The present study was undertaken to examine the effects of lithium and PGA1 on heat shock proteins (HSP) and the growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible gene (GADD153) and to evaluate if lithium could potentiate PGA(1)'s neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia. Rats were pretreated with a subcutaneous injection of lithium for 2 days and a single intracerebral ventricle administration of PGA(1) 15 min before ischemic insult. Brain ischemia was induced by a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion. The infarct volume, motor behavior deficits and brain edema were analyzed 24 h after ischemic insult. The result showed that PGA(1) significantly reduced infarct volume, neurological deficits and brain edema. Except for neurological deficit, lithium enhanced PGA(1)'s neuroprotection. The neuroprotective effects of PGA(1) were associated with an up-regulation of cytoprotective heat shock proteins HSP70 and GRP78 in the ischemic brain hemisphere as determined by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. The induction of HSP70 and GRP78 was enhanced by lithium. However, although the expression of GADD153 was enhanced significantly after pMCAO, it was not influenced by either PGA(1) or lithium or their combination. These studies suggest that lithium can potentiate PGA(1)'s neuroprotective effects and thus may have potential clinical value for the treatment of stroke in combination with other neuroprotective agents.
