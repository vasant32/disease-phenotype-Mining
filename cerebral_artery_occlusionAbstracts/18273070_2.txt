 OBJECTIVE: To investigate effects of K(ATP) opener on the expressions of caspase-12 mRNA and protein, and to explore the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway in the mechanism of K(ATP) opener protecting against neuronal apoptosis after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. METHODS: Two hundred rats were randomly divided into four groups: sham operation group, ischemia-reperfusion group, K(ATP) opener group, and K(ATP) blocker group. The middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was established by intraluminal suture occlusion method; neuronal apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining. The mRNA and protein expressions of caspase-12 were detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining, respectively. RESULTS: In ischemia-reperfusion group, K(ATP) opener group and K(ATP) blocker group, the number of apoptotic cells and the mRNA and protein expressions of caspase-12 gradually increased following cerebral reperfusion, and reached the peak at 24 h. In K(ATP) opener group, the number of apoptotic cells was significantly less than that in ischemia-reperfusion group and K(ATP) blocker group at 12 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h (P< 0.05 or P< 0.01); while the mRNA and protein levels of caspase-12 were significantly less than those in ischemia-reperfusion group and K(ATP) blocker group at all times (P< 0.05 or P< 0.01). There were no differences between the ischemia-reperfusion group and K(ATP) blocker group at each time (P> 0.05). CONCLUSION: K(ATP) opener may protect neurons from apoptosis following the cerebral ischemia-reperfusion by inhibiting ER stress pathway.
