AIM: To study the influences of ginsenosides Rb1 and Rg1 (active components of the total saponins of Panax ginseng) on the brains against ischemia-reperfusion injury. METHODS: Rat focal cerebral ischemia was induced by reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) without craniectomy. The influences of ginsenoside Rb1 and Rg1 on infarct size (IS), neurologic deficit (ND) and the contents of calcium and potassium in the infarct were observed. RESULTS: In a 2-h ischemia, Rb1 10-40 mg.kg-1 i.v. 30 min before MCAO decreased IS by 20%-49% and ND score from 5.1 to 4.1-2.3, and inhibited Ca accumulation and K loss by 22%-50% and 18-37%, respectively; Rb1 10-40 mg.kg-1 i.v. immediately after MCA was recanalized decreased IS by 12%-35% and ND score from 5.2 to 4.3-3.3, and inhibited Ca accumulation and K loss by 10%-40% and 17%-30%, respectively. In permanent ischemia, Rb1 40 mg.kg-1 i.v. reduced IS, ND, Ca accumulation and K loss. However, Rg1 40 mg.kg-1 i.v. did not show effect on both permanent and 2-h MCAO. CONCLUSIONS: Rb1 protected brain from ischemic and reperfusion injuries.
