The role of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) in brain injury is controversial. We studied the effect of anti-TNF-alpha antibody in a rat model of reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion. During focal ischemia and early reperfusion, TNF-alpha was rapidly and transiently released into circulation. Pretreatment with intravenous anti-TNF-alpha antibody reduced cortical (71%, P < 0.015) and subcortical (58%, P < 0.007) injury, enhanced the cerebral blood flow during reperfusion, and improved the neurologic outcome. This further supports the contention that TNF-alpha is a deleterious cytokine in stroke, whereas circulating antibody against TNF-alpha may protect brain from reperfusion injury.
