PURPOSE: Effective collateral blood flow seem to be an important factor associated with a small infarct volume and a good clinical outcome. We aimed to assess leptomeningeal collateral blood flow on source perfusion-weighted images in patients with acute stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 29 patients with proximal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCA alone, n=17; MCA + internal carotid artery [ICA] occlusion, n=12) were evaluated with MRI at baseline before thrombolytic therapy, and at day 60. Clinical evaluation was performed at days 0 and 60 with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, and at day 60 with the modified Rankin score. We assessed (on source images of the dynamic contrast-enhanced T2*-weighted perfusion [PWI] sequence) the presence of a hypointensity consistent with delayed contrast arrival within the global perfusion deficit (delayed perfusion sign). We analyzed the extent of the area demonstrating such delayed perfusion (DP area) on source images of the PWI sequence, and compared it with the global perfusion (GP) abnormality shown by time-to-peak maps. We calculated the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between the DP/GP ratio and: 1. age; 2. clinical scores; 3. site of occlusion [MCA alone versus ICA+MCA occlusion]; 4. DWI lesion size at day 0, and T2WI lesion size at day 60; 5. PWI-derived parameters (time-to-peak [TTP], relative cerebral blood volume [rCBV], relative cerebral blood flow [rCBF], and peak height). All tests were bilateral and a p value<0.05 was considered as significant. RESULTS: Delayed perfusion areas of various size were found within the global perfusion deficit in all patients. High DP/GP ratio values were significantly correlated with: 1. better clinical scores at day 0 and day 60 (all p<=0.04); 2. smaller lesions at day 0 DWI and at day 60 T2WI (all p<=0.004); 3. ICA patency (r=0.49, p=0.01); 4. lower TTP delays, and higher values of rCBV, rCBF, and peak height. CONCLUSION: These preliminary data suggest that a delayed contrast filling observed on native perfusion-weighted images may be a marker of leptomeningeal collateral blood flow, and may lead to better clinical and morphological outcomes in acute ischemic stroke.
