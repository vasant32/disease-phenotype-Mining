Amyloid precursor protein binding protein-1 (APP-BP1) binds to the carboxyl terminus of APP. In this study, we explored whether APP-BP1 expression is affected by focal transient cerebral ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion in Wistar rats. APP-BP1 expression was increased in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and in the subventricular zone of rats exposed to focal transient cerebral ischemia. In addition, APP-BP1 immunoreactivity overlapped with antidoublecortin and anti-5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine labeling. Focal transient cerebral ischemia has been reported earlier to induce neurogenesis in adult brains. The upregulation of APP-BP1 expression in neural progenitor cells after focal transient ischemia suggests that this protein contributes to the neurogenesis induced by transient ischemia and reperfusion.
