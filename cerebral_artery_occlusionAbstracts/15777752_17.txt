Statins possess neuroprotective effect against ischemic damage, but how they protect neurons is not exactly made clear. We speculated that anti-oxidative property of statins is implicated, and investigated statins' influences on the oxidative neuronal damage in the brain after ischemia. After 14 days of atorvastatin, pitavastatin, simvastatin, or vehicle administration, 90 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion was imposed on Wistar rats. The production of 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), both of which are oxidative stress markers, as well as infarction formation were investigated at 1 day after the reperfusion. In the vehicle group, massive infarction was confirmed and HNE and 8-OHdG are robustly produced. In the statins-treated group, the infarction was smaller and the HNE and 8-OHdG production was less prominent than the vehicle group. Among the statins investigated, simvastatin was most effective for reducing oxidative stress and infarction volume, which may be brought by its highly lipophilic property. Reduction of oxidative stress by statins may be one main reason in ameliorating ischemic brain damage in rats.
