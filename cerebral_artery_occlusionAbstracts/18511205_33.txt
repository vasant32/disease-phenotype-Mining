Inflammation following ischemic stroke is known to contribute to injury. NADPH oxidase (NOX) is a major enzyme system originally studied in immune cells that leads to superoxide (O.*) generation. Apocynin is a NOX inhibitor that has been studied as a potential treatment in experimental stroke. Here we explored the effect of different doses of apocynin in a mouse model of 2 h transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) followed by 22 h reperfusion. Apocynin, given i.v. at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg 30 min before reperfusion, improved neurological function (P<0.01), reduced infarct volume (P<0.05), and reduced the incidence of cerebral hemorrhage (P<0.05), but not at higher doses of 3.75 and 5 mg/kg, where it actually increased brain hemorrhage. Apocynin also tended to reduce mortality at the lower dose, but not at higher doses. Using hydroethine fluorescence to delineate O.* in the brain, neurons and some microglia/macrophages, but not vascular endothelial cells were found to contain O.*. Apocynin at protective doses markedly prevented ischemia-induced increases in O.*. Our data suggested that apocynin can protect against experimental stroke, but with a narrow therapeutic window.
