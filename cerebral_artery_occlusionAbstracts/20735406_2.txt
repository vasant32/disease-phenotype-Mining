 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: 20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid is a potent vasoconstrictor that contributes to cerebral ischaemia. An inhibitor of 20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid synthesis, TS-011, reduces infarct volume and improves neurological deficits in animal stroke models. However, little is known about how TS-011 affects the microvessels in ischaemic brain. Here, we investigated the effect of TS-011 on microvessels after cerebral ischaemia. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: TS-011 (0.3 mgÂ·kg(-1) ) or a vehicle was infused intravenously for 1 h every 6 h in a mouse model of stroke, induced by transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery occlusion following photothrombosis. The cerebral blood flow velocity and the vascular perfusion area of the peri-infarct microvessels were measured using in vivo two-photon imaging. KEY RESULTS: The cerebral blood flow velocities in the peri-infarct microvessels decreased at 1 and 7 h after reperfusion, followed by an increase at 24 h after reperfusion in the vehicle-treated mice. We found that TS-011 significantly inhibited both the decrease and the increase in the blood flow velocities in the peri-infarct microvessels seen in the vehicle-treated mice after reperfusion. In addition, TS-011 significantly inhibited the reduction in the microvascular perfusion area after reperfusion, compared with the vehicle-treated group. Moreover, TS-011 significantly reduced the infarct volume by 40% at 72 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These findings demonstrated that infusion of TS-011 improved defects in the autoregulation of peri-infarct microcirculation and reduced the infarct volume. Our results could be relevant to the treatment of cerebral ischaemia.
