We sought to determine whether induction of apoptosis alters an ischemic lesion. Rats were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) and treated with staurosporine (n=8) or vehicle (n=4). Our data demonstrate that at 22 h after MCAo, staurosporine triggered a significant increase in apoptosis, a reduction of lesion volume and an increase of synaptophysin immunoreactivity, as compared to the control group.
