PURPOSE: To investigate infarct evolution and functional consequences of exclusive subcortical or cortico-subcortical strokes, transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was conducted in Wistar rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MCAO was induced in male Wistar rats (260-300 g) for 60 minutes. Lesion volumes and absolute T2 times on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were assessed 1 and 14 days after MCAO using a 4.7-T MRI animal scanner in conjunction with functional testing (adhesive tape removal, cylinder test, and ledged beam walking). RESULTS: Functional test scores were not distinguishable between sham-operated animals (N = 5) and those with exclusive caudoputaminal infarct (N = 8; group cp), but showed significant deficits in animals with cortico-subcortical infarction (N = 10; group cp+). The cp group had lower absolute T2 times and a more pronounced reduction in T2 lesion volume over time than the subcortical component in the cp+ group. There was no correlation of T2 lesion size or absolute T2 times and functional impairment in either group. CONCLUSION: When judged from functional tests alone, subcortical ischemic lesions may not be diagnosed reliably. Furthermore, T2-weighted (T2-w) MRI does not well anticipate functional deficits in primarily striatal lesions.
