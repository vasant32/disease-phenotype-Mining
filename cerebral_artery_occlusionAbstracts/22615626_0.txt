BACKGROUND AND THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Cerebral ischemia is one of the main causes of long term disability and death in aged populations. Many herbal drugs and extracts have been used for the treatment of cerebral ischemia induced insults. This study was designed to investigate the protective effect of Semelil (ANGIPARSâ„¢), a new herbal drug, on focal cerebral ischemia in male rats.  MATERIAL AND METHODS: MALE RATS WERE DIVIDED INTO FIVE GROUPS: sham-operated, ischemic animals treated with distilled water as vehicle, ischemic animals treated with 1, 10 and 100 mg/kg of Semilil respectively. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was used in NMRI rats and neuronal injury analyzed in hippocampal CA1 sector after 48 hrs of Middle Cerebral Artery (MCAO).  RESULTS: Results of this study showed that treatment with semelil attenuated ischemic damages and has positive effects on focal cerebral ischemia.
