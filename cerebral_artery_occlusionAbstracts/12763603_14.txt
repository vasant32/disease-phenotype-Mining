It is unknown whether immediate early gene (IEG) induction and subsequent late gene regulation after ischemia is beneficial or deleterious. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of hypothermia on expression of c-Fos and c-Jun, and AP-1 DNA binding activity, after transient focal cerebral ischemia in rat brain, and clarify the role of IEGs and AP-1 after insults. Male Wistar rats underwent right middle cerebral artery occlusion for 1 h with the intraluminal suture method. During ischemia, animals were assigned to either normothermic (NT) or hypothermic (HT) groups. In the NT group, brain temperature was observed to spontaneously increase to 40 degrees C during ischemia. In the HT group, brain temperature decreased to 30 degrees C. Infarct volume in cortex was decreased in the HT group, compared with that in the NT group (P<0.001). Increased c-Fos immunoreactivity in the cortex was observed at 3 h after reperfusion in the HT, but not the NT group, while c-Jun expression was not affected by HT treatment. There was also a significant increase in AP-1 DNA binding activity at 3 h in the HT group when compared to the NT group (P<0.01). In conclusion, hypothermia decreased cerebral infarction in association with early increases in c-Fos expression and AP-1 DNA binding activity in peri-infarct cortex. It remains to be established whether such responses are a cause or consequence of cell survival, but these results clearly establish that altered transcription is a key feature of tissue spared following hypothermic focal ischemia.
