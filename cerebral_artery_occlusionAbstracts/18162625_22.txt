BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Statins exert rapid cholesterol-independent vasoprotective effects. Here, we tested whether postevent treatment with intravenously (i.v.) administered rosuvastatin improves acute stroke outcome in mice. METHODS: 129/SV wild-type mice were subjected to 1-hour filamentous middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo), followed by reperfusion, and were postevent treated with i.v. or intraperitoneal (i.p.) rosuvastatin given up to 6 hours after MCAo (dose range 0.02 to 20 mg kg(-1) body weight). RESULTS: Rosuvastatin, when administered i.v., significantly reduced lesion size when given up to 4 hours after MCAo and in doses as low as 0.2 mg kg(-1). In contrast, i.p. administration provided protection only when given directly on reperfusion at a dose of 20 mg kg(-1) but not at lower doses or later time points. Lesion protection was evident as late as 5 days after brain ischemia and was associated with functional improvements in the pole-test and wire-hanging test (2.0 mg kg(-1) dose). Neuroprotection with i.v. rosuvastatin was achieved with peak plasma concentrations <0.5 ng ml(-1) (ie, with 0.2 mg kg(-1)) and was associated with increased levels of phosphorylated Akt kinase and endothelial nitric oxide synthase in the vasculature. CONCLUSIONS: Rosuvastatin, given intravenously at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, protects from focal brain ischemia up to 4 hours after an event. In our opinion, the development of an intravenous statin formulation is warranted for acute stroke trials with statins in humans.
