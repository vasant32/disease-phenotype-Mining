Cervical spinal cord stimulation (cSCS) has been employed as a treatment for intractable pain for the past 20 years. Recently, we reported that cSCS increased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in cats and humans. The present study was designed to examine the effects of cSCS on experimental cerebral strokes, using a cat middle cerebral artery occlusion model (MCAO). A total of 31 cats were randomly assigned to three groups; Group 1: control, Group 2: sham operation, Group 3: cSCS. Mortality of the control group was 92% as long as 4 days after MCAO. Groups 2 and 3 showed a prolongation of survival rate (44% and 56%, respectively). CSCS reduced the rate of death within 24 hours after MCAO. There was no alteration of infarct size, which was estimated by the TTC method and measured by computer technique (PDP-11/23), was found in dead cats of all groups. In cats that survived in Group 3, however, drastic prevention of an infarct progression was found, compared to Group 2. The results provide a clinical application of cSCS for stroke patients, although no evident mechanism was obtained.
