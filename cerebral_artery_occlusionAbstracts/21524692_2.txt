Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is a hypoxia-inducible neuroprotective protein that also stimulates proliferation of neuronal precursor cells. In this study, we investigated the possible role of HB-EGF in ischemia and reperfusion injury by measuring the changes in its mRNA expression following focal cerebral ischemia. We also examined neural damage after a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and reperfusion in ventral forebrain specific HB-EGF knockout (KO) mice. The levels of HB-EGF mRNA in the cerebral cortex of wild-type (WT) mice were significantly increased 3-24 h after MCAO and reperfusion. Cerebral infraction in HB-EGF KO mice was aggravated at 1 day and 6 days after MCAO and reperfusion compared with WT mice. The number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dNTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and an oxidative stress marker, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) positive cells, were higher in HB-EGF KO mice than in WT mice. On the other hand, fewer bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) positive cells were found in the subventricular zone in HB-EGF KO mice compared with WT mice. These results indicate that HB-EGF may play a pivotal role in ischemia and reperfusion injury and that endogenously synthesized HB-EGF is necessary for both the neuroprotective effect and for regulation of cell proliferation in the subventricular zone.
