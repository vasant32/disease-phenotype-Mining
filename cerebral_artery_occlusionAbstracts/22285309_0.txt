Cannabinoids have emerged as brain protective agents under neurodegenerative conditions. Many neuroprotective actions of cannabinoids depend on the activation of specific receptors, cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) and type 2 (CB2R). The aim of the present study was to determine whether the CB2R and CB1R agonist WIN 55,212-2 (WIN) protects neonatal brain against focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion and whether anti-inflammatory mechanisms play a role in protection. Seven-day-old rats were subjected to 90-min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and injured rats were identified by diffusion-weighted MRI during the occlusion. After reperfusion, rats were subcutaneously administered 1 mg/kg of WIN or vehicle twice daily until sacrifice. MCAO led to increased mRNA expression of CB2R (but not CB1R), chemokine receptors (CCR2 and CX3CR1), and cytokines (IL-1β and TNFα), as well as increased protein expression of chemokines MCP-1 and MIP-1α and microglial activation 24 h after MCAO. WIN administration significantly reduced microglial activation at this point and attenuated infarct volume and microglial accumulation and proliferation in the injured cortex 72 h after MCAO. Cumulatively, our results show that the cannabinoid agonist WIN protects against neonatal focal stroke in part due to inhibitory effects on microglia.
