OBJECTIVE: To establish a new macrophotographic measurement of brain surface area to evaluate brain edema after focal cerebral ischemia in mice. METHODS: Permanent focal cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice. The brains were removed 10,30 min,1,3,6,12 and 24 h after MCAO, and photographed in dorsal and lateral views by a digital camera. Then, 6 coronal slices of 1 mm thick were cut and photographed. Finally, the water content of brain tissue was measured by heating at 110 degrees C for 24 h. The left and right hemisphere areas of the brains and the brain slices were analyzed and calculated by MedBrain 2 imaging analyzer to evaluate brain edema. RESULT: The macrophotographic measurement showed that the ischemic hemisphere areas significantly increased from 1 h after focal cerebral ischmia, which was similar to the measurement of water content. This measurement for brain edema correlated well with those of water content and brain slice volume. CONCLUSION: The macrophotographic measurement is an objective and quantitative method for evaluating brain edema after focal cerebral ischemia.
