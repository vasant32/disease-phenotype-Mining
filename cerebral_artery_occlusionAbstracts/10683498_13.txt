The purpose of the present study was to assess the magnitude and stability of a number of functional deficits in rats subjected to occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO). Three groups of rats, treated with 90-min, 120-min, or sham occlusion were used in functional studies for 22 weeks following surgery. The following tests were used: methamphetamine-induced rotation, the staircase test, acquisition of operant responding, running-wheel behavior, and performance of operant differential reinforcement of a low-rate responding (DRL) schedule of reinforcement. Histology performed at 23 weeks following infarct showed on average modest damage of a 19% reduction in hemispheric volume. Of the behavioral tests conducted, rotation, the staircase test, and the operant DRL were sensitive to ischemic damage, and were under some circumstances related to lesion size. These data show that long-term functional deficits following MCAO are demonstrable, and hence, assessment of long-term neuroprotection is feasible.
