The current investigation examined the role of estrogen in central autonomic regulatory nuclei on the autonomic dysfunction resulting from middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Experiments were done in anaesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats. The effect of MCAO on autonomic tone was assessed by monitoring vagal and renal efferent nerve activities before and following systemic administration of either estrogen or saline and the bilateral microinjection of the estrogen receptor antagonist, ICI 182, 780, into several autonomic nuclei (the intrathecal space of the spinal cord, nucleus tractus solitarius, nucleus ambiguus, rostral ventrolateral medulla, parabrachial nucleus, central nucleus of the amygdala or ventral posteromedial thalamus). Autonomic reflex function was evoked using intravenous injection of increasing doses of phenylephrine (0.025-0.1 mg/kg) and the peak changes in heart rate and blood pressure were plotted to obtain the baroreflex sensitivity. The presence of ICI 182, 780 in the intrathecal space of the spinal cord, nucleus ambiguous, nucleus tractus solitarius, rostral ventrolateral medulla, parabrachial nucleus, or central nucleus of the amygdala prior to the administration of estrogen resulted in a significant attenuation (ranging from 79% to 94 %) in the estrogen-induced recovery of autonomic function following MCAO. Blocking estrogen receptors in the ventral posteromedial thalamus had no effect on the ability of estrogen to prevent the MCAO-induced changes in autonomic function. These results suggest that the estrogen-mediated recovery of autonomic function following MCAO is dependent on the availability of estrogen receptors in several forebrain and brainstem autonomic nuclei.
