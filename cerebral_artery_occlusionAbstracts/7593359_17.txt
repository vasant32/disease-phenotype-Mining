The first 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) are likely critical in determining the final outcome in ischemic stroke. To study this early postischemic period, male Wistar rats (n = 161) were subjected to right MCAO with closely spaced step variations in both duration of MCAO and blood pressure (BP), using the intraluminal suture technique. Quantitative neuropathology was performed at 25 coronal planes of the brain after 1-week survival. Atrophy was measured as the difference between the two hemispheres and was added to cortical and striatal necrosis to obtain total tissue loss. Damage consistently increased monotonically with increasing duration of occlusion only when infarct size was expressed as percentage of the contralateral hemisphere, but not when expressed as mm3, because of variable tissue size. The results showed that already at 1 week, the quantity of tissue loss due to resorption and transsynaptic effects approached the quantity of geographically traceable necrosis in cortex and striatum. Minimum brain damage (5%) occurred after 60 min at a BP of 80 mm Hg, with almost no cortical necrosis. Damage was extremely sensitive to hypotension and MCAO duration. At a BP of 40 mm Hg, 60 min of MCAO produced 25% damage, accelerating every 20 min during the 2-h period studied. At BP 80 mm Hg, 120 min of MCAO produced the same damage as only 80 min of MCAO at BP 60 mm Hg. At 60-, 80-, 100-, and 120-min duration of MCAO, infarct size was significantly reduced with increasing BP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
