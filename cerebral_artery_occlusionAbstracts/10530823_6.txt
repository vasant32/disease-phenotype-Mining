Recent reports have suggested a role for group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in the attenuation of excitotoxicity. Here we examined the effects of the recently available group II agonist (+)-2-Aminobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2-6-dicarboxylic acid (LY354740) on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxic neuronal death, as well as on hypoxic-ischemic neuronal death both in vitro and in vivo. At concentrations shown to be selective for group II mGluRs expressed in cell lines (0.1-100 nM), LY354740 did not attenuate NMDA-mediated neuronal death in vitro or in vivo. Furthermore, LY354740 did not attenuate oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced neuronal death in vitro or ischemic infarction after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats. In addition, the neuroprotective effect of another group II agonist, (S)-4-carboxy-3-phenylglycine (4C3HPG), which has shown injury attenuating effects both in vitro and in vivo, was not blocked by the group II antagonists (2 S)-alpha-ethylglutamic acid (EGLU), (RS)-alpha-methyl-4-sulphonophenylglycine (MSPG), or the group III antagonist (S)-alpha-methyl-3-carboxyphenylalanine (MCPA), suggesting that this neuroprotection may be mediated by other effects such as upon group I mGluRs.
