The aim of this study was to determine the effect of mood disorders, including psychological distress and depression, on stroke outcome. Male Fischer rats were exposed to immobilisation stress, an animal paradigm of psychological stress, major depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Either a subacute (1 h for 7 days) or a chronic (6 h for 21 days) exposure to stress was applied 24 h before permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Stroke outcome was assessed by measurement of infarct size and behavioural characterisation. Serum glutamate and brain ATP levels as well as brain glutamate transporter function and expression were studied in the search for the molecular mechanisms involved. Subacute stress exposure increased infarct size and decreased behavioural scores after stroke. On the contrary, chronic stress exposure decreased infarct size. Peak serum glutamate levels correlated with infarct size after MCAO. Expression of glutamate transporters was decreased by subacute stress, whereas the expression of EAAT1, a glial glutamate carrier, was increased after the chronic stress protocol. Our results indicate that distinct patterns of stress determine different stroke outcomes, and that expressional changes of brain glutamate transporters, able to affect glutamate release after stroke, are involved.
