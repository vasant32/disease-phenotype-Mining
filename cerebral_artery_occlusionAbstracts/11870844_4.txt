Region-specific cerebral blood flow (CBF) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of water in the rat brain were quantified in vivo by high-field MRI (9.4 T) for 6-7 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Upon occlusion, average CBF fell from about 1.5-2 ml/g/min to below 0.5 ml/g/min in cortical areas and the amygdala, and below 0.2 ml/g/min in the caudate putamen. CBF in some of the homologous contralateral areas also decreased by 20-30%. Average ADC decreased from about 8 center dot 10(-4) to 5 center dot 10(-4) mm(2)/s in the caudate putamen and parietal cortex. Corresponding changes in ADC were lower in the frontal cortex and negligible in the piriform cortex, suggesting that the perfusion threshold for ADC decrease may be different for different brain regions in the same animal. The area of decreased ADC correlated well with the infarction area revealed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining of brain slices in vitro. A better understanding of the mechanisms linking ADC and CBF changes to ischemic cell disorders may prove useful in characterizing the degree of tissue damage, and in developing and evaluating treatment strategies.
