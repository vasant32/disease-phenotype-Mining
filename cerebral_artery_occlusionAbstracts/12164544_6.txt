The effects of Lamotrigine (LTG) which blocks ischemia induced glutamate (Glu) release, on lipid peroxidation have been evaluated in cortical and cerebellar tissues of rat brain during focal cerebral ischemia. A total of 45 rats were randomly assigned into one of four groups; sham operated animals as controls, animals subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and treatment groups with LTG (20 mg/kg i.p.) either 30 min before or just after MCAO. Changes in lipid peroxides were expressed as nanomoles of malondialdehyde (MDA) and conjugated diene (CD) per milligram of protein. MDA values following 60 min of ischemia relative to contralateral cortex and CD levels in 0, 10 and 60 min of ischemia were found to be higher in the ipsilateral cortex than those in the contralateral cortex. On the other hand, contralateral cerebellar MDA levels after 0 and 60 min of ischemia and CD levels after 0, 10 and 60 min of ischemia were higher than those in the ipsilateral cerebellum. Pharmacological inhibition of Glu release significantly decreased the MDA and CD production in both cortex and cerebellum. Pre- or post-ischemic administration of LTG did not significantly change CD levels, but MDA levels in contralateral cortex were found to be significantly decreased than those in ischemic cortex in both pre- and post-treated group.
