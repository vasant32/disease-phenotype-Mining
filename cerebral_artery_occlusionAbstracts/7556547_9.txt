The present study examines the capacity of fetal neocortical grafts placed in a brain infarct to exchange axonal projections with the host brain. Five to 7 days after a middle cerebral artery occlusion in adult spontaneously hypertensive rats, dissociated neocortical primordium from fetuses of gestational age 15-16 days was implanted into the infarcted area. Four to 11 months later, the neural tracers Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin and Fluoro-Gold were injected in the grafts and host neocortex. An extensive axonal network was present in the transplants but only one of eight rats with appropriate placed injections displayed efferent connections from transplant to host. The sparse axonal outgrowth indicates major limitations for fetal rat cortical grafts to form connections with host neural circuitries after an ischemic insult.
