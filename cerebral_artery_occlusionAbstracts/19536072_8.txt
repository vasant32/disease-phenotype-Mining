Neurogenesis and angiogenesis in the subventricular zone and peri-infarct region have been confirmed. However, newly formed neuronal cells and blood vessels that appear in the nonischemic ipsilateral ventroposterior nucleus (VPN) of the thalamus with secondary damage after stroke has not been previously studied. Twenty-four stroke-prone renovascular hypertensive rats were subjected to distal right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) or sham operation. 5'-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was used to label cell proliferation. Rats were killed at 7 or 14 days after the operation. Neuronal nuclei (NeuN), OX-42, BrdU, nestin, laminin(+), BrdU(+)/nestin(+), BrdU(+)/NeuN(+), nestin(+)/GFAP(+)(glial fibrillary acidic protein), and BrdU(+)/laminin(+) immunoreactive cells were detected within the ipsilateral VPN. The primary infarction was confined to the right somatosensory cortex. Within the ipsilateral VPN of the ischemic rats, the number of NeuN(+) neurons decreased, the OX-42(+) microglia cells were activated, and BrdU(+) and nestin(+) cells were detected at day 7 after MCAO and increased in number at day 14. Moreover, BrdU(+)/nestin(+) cells and BrdU(+)/NeuN(+) cells were detected at day 14 after MCAO. In addition, the ischemic rats showed a significant increase in vascular density in the ipsilateral VPN compared with the sham-operated rats. These results suggest that secondary damage with neurogenesis and angiogenesis of the ipsilateral VPN of the thalamus occurs after focal cortical infarction.
