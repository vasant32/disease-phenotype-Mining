OBJECTIVE: To investigate the protective effects of resveratrol on inflammatory process induced by focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in rats. METHOD: Rats were pretreated with resvreratrol at the dose of 10, 20, 40 mg kg(-1) for 7 days and then subjected to cerebral ischemia/reperfusion induced by a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The infarct volume and the neurological deficit were determined by the method of TTC (2, 3, 5-triphenylterazolium chloride) staining and Longa's score. The permeability of blood-brain barrier (BBB) was evaluated by measurement of the evans blue (EB) content in the brain with spectrophotometer. The content of interleukin-lbeta, interleukin-6 (IL-6, IL-1beta) in serum and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), myeloperoxidase (MPO) in brain were determined by radio-immunoassay and ELISA assay. RESULT: Resveratrol reduced infarct volume, ameliorated the neurological deficit and the permeability of BBB, the content of IL-6, IL-1beta in serum and TNF-alpha, MPO activity in brain tissue also were significantly decreased. CONCLUSION: These results showed that resveratrol had protective effects on cerebral injury by inhibiting the releasing of the inflammatory mediators after ischemia/reperfusion injury.
