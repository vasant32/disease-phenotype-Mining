OBJECTIVE: To discuss the protective effect of Niuhuang Shangqing pills (NSP) on the experimental cerebral ischemia and the influence of blood rheology in animals. METHOD: Using the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), bilateral common carotid artery ligation and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in combination with carrogeenin (Ca)-induced stagnation of blood model rats, we investigated the influence of NSP on the physical sign indexes, brain infarct size and the water content, the content of lactate(LD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA) and the blood rheology. RESULT: The 3.00, 1.50 g x kg(-1) dosage groups of NSP decreased the neurosigns indexes, significantly reduced the brain infarct areas in MCAO rats, decreased the brain water content, increased the activities of GPx and CAT, decreased the content of LD and MDA in bilateral common carotid artery ligation rats. They improved the blood rheology in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in combination with carrogeenin (Ca)-induced stagnation of blood model rats. CONCLUSION: NSP has the function of protective effect on experimental experimental cerebral ischemia.
