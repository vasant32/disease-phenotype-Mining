The neuroprotective effects of a systemically active, potent, group II selective metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist, LY354740, was assessed in the middle cerebral artery occlusion model of focal ischaemia in rats. LY354740 (0.3, 3.0 or 30.0 mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously (s.c.) 30 min prior to and 3 hours after the induction of ischaemia. Twenty four hours after the ischaemic insult, the brains were processed for the evaluation of infarct volumes. No significant reduction in infarct volumes were observed in treated animals at any of the doses investigated. These data provide no support for the view that group II metabotropic glutamate receptors have a major influence on ischaemic damage in this model.
