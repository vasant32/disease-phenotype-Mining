The effects of deep hypothermia on ischemic neuronal injury were examined using a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion model in the rat. Animals were maintained at temporalis temperatures of either 24 degrees C or 36 degrees C and killed 6 hours after arterial occlusion. Normothermic rats displayed an average infarct volume of 25.1% +/- 1.6% of the right hemisphere, whereas hypothermic rats had an average infarct volume of 4.1% +/- 1.3% (p less than 0.001). The right/left hemispheric ratio was 1.05 +/- 0.02 in the normothermic group and 1.00 +/- 0.02 in the hypothermic group (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that hypothermia to 24 degrees C may reduce cerebral infarction and edema formation following middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat.
