Neurotropin, an inhibitor of the kallikrein-kinin system, has been used as an analgesic and anti-allergic drug in the clinic. The aims of this study are to evaluate the effect of neurotropin on brain edema induced by permanent focal cerebral ischemia in rats and collateral ventricular injection of carrageenan in mice and its mechanism. Drugs were given i.v. 15 minutes after middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats and immediately after carrageenan injection in mice. Brain water content was determined by wet/dry weight ratio. Results showed that neurotropin could reduce the brain edema induced by permanent focal cerebral ischemia in rats and collateral ventricular injection of carrageenan in mice at doses of 3.0, 6.0, 30.0 and 30.0 NU.kg-1 body weight. It also suggests that neurotropin reduced ischemic brain edema via inhibiting the kallikrein-kinin system.
