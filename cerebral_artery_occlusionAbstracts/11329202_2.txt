For fast (13)C metabolite mapping in rat brains, (1)H-detected (13)C NMR spectroscopy using gradient-enhanced heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence and (1)H echo planar spectroscopic imaging were combined. (13)C glucose and 3-/4-(13)C-Glu/Gln images of rat brain were successfully constructed with 35-minute temporal resolution under a 2T magnetic field. In the ischemic region of the suture middle cerebral artery occlusion model, glucose and Glu/Gln signals decreased and lactate signals appeared. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2001;13:787-791.
