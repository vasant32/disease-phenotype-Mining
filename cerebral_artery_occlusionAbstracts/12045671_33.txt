A novel agent, (R)-(-)-2-propyloctanoic acid (ONO-2506), has a unique property in that it modulates functions of activated cultured astrocytes, including pronounced inhibition of S-100beta synthesis. The present study examined whether administration of this agent would mitigate the delayed expansion of infarct volume and the neurologic deficits after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) in rats. Daily intravenous administration of ONO-2506 (10 mg/kg) abolished the delayed infarct expansion between 24 and 168 hours after pMCAO, whereas the acute infarct expansion until 24 hours was unaffected. The agent significantly reduced the expression of S-100beta and glial fibrillary acidic protein in the activated astrocytes and the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated 2;-deoxyuridine 5;-triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling-positive cells in the periinfarct area. The neurologic deficits were significantly improved, compared with the vehicle-treated groups, as early as 24 hours after the initial administration of ONO-2506. The agent had a wide therapeutic time window of 0 to 48 hours after pMCAO. These results indicate that because of the pharmacologic modulation of astrocytic activation induced by ONO-2506, symptoms can regress whereas delayed expansion of the lesion is arrested. Pharmacologic modulation of astrocytic activation may confer a novel therapeutic strategy against stroke.
