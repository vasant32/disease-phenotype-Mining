The authors report a method for measuring total local brain tissue pressure (BTP) using a miniature catheter transducer stereotaxically introduced into the white matter of the cat's cerebrum. Quantitative rapid phasic pressure changes were satisfactorily demonstrated. Due to some drift of baseline of the transducers and inability to perform in vivo calibration, reliable long-term quantitative pressure measurements sometimes could not be studied. The BTP from each cerebral hemisphere and the cisternal pressure (CP) were monitored during alterations of pCO-2 and systemic blood pressure, and distilled H20 injection prior to and after right middle cerebral artery (MCA) ligation. The catheter transducers functioned well on chronic implantation for up to 6 weeks. Compared to the chronically implanted catheters, acutely implanted catheters responded identically except for drift. The response of intracranial pressure and CP to MCA occlusion, alterations in pCO2, and systemic blood pressure were similar. No BTP gradients appeared in response to MCA ligation, hypercapnia, hypertension, or progressive swelling of the resulting infarction.
