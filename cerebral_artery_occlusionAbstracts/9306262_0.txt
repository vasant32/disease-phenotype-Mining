AE0047 [4-(4-benzhydrylpiperazino)phenethyl methyl 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-4-(3-nitrophenyl)-3,5-pyridine dicarboxylate dihydrochloride] is a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with protective effects against cerebral ischaemia and the occurrence of stroke in several animal models. We investigated the effects of AE0047 on focal ischaemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats. AE0047 at a dose causing 20 or 40% systemic hypotension (1 or 3 mg kg-1) was given orally twice, 15 min and 24 h after occlusion. The neurological status of animals was investigated 2, 24 and 48 h after occlusion. Infarct area of brain was measured 48 h after occlusion. Middle cerebral artery occlusion resulted in the progressive deterioration of neurological status and large infarction in middle cerebral artery territories with 40% mortality. AE0047 dose-dependently attenuated the deterioration of neurological status, and reduced mortality to 0 or 10%. AE0047 significantly reduced infarct size and left/right hemispheric area ratio, an index of brain swelling. These results suggest that AE0047 has the ability to ameliorate ischaemic cerebral stroke in hypertensive patients.
