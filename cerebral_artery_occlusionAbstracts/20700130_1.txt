Alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) is a neuropeptide with profound immunomodulatory properties; we evaluated the effects of α-MSH on stroke outcome and its ability to modulate the postischemic immune response. In Lewis rats subjected to 3 hours of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), plasma concentrations of α-MSH rapidly decreased and returned to baseline over the course of days. Exogenous administration of α-MSH (100 or 500 μg/kg) improved 24 hour outcome in animals subjected to 2 hours MCAO; α-MSH 500 μg/kg also decreased infarct volume at this time point. Both doses of α-MSH were ineffective in improving outcome or decreasing infarct volume in animals subjected to 3 hours MCAO. The splenocyte response to phytohemagglutin in animals treated with α-MSH was attenuated at 24 hours after MCAO. At 1 month after MCAO, treatment with α-MSH 500 μg/kg at the time of stoke was associated with a decrease in TH1 response to myelin basic protein (MBP) in animals subjected to 2 hours MCAO, although treatment was not associated with improved outcome at this time point. Given the early benefits of α-MSH treatment and its effect on immunologic outcome, further studies to evaluate the utility of α-MSH for the treatment of cerebral ischemia are warranted.
