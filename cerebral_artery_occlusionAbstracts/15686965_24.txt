Cell replacement therapy may have the potential to promote brain repair and recovery after stroke. To compare how focal cerebral ischemia affects the entry, migration, and phenotypic features of neural precursor cells transplanted by different routes, we administered neuronal precursors from embryonic cerebral cortex of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing transgenic mice to rats that had undergone middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) by the intrastriatal, intraventricular, and intravenous routes. MCAO increased the entry of GFP-immunoreactive cells, most of which expressed neuroepithelial (nestin) or neuronal (doublecortin) markers, from the ventricles and bloodstream into the brain, and enhanced their migration when delivered by any of these routes. Transplanted neural precursors migrated into the ischemic striatum and cerebral cortex. Thus, transplantation of neural precursors by a variety of routes can deliver cells with the potential to replace injured neurons to ischemic brain regions.
