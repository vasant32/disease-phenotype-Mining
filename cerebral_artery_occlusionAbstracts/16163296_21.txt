We previously observed degranulated mast cells (MC) in association with perivascular brain edema formation during focal cerebral ischemia. Brain MC are typically located perivascularly and contain potent fast-acting vasoactive and proteolytic substances. We examined in a rat model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) whether, in the early phase of ischemia, MC regulate microcirculation, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and edema formation. First, animals received MC inhibitor (cromoglycate), MC-degranulating drug (compound 48/80), or saline. Thereafter, we performed transient MCAO in gene-manipulated MC-deficient rats and their wild-type (WT) littermates, calculating brain swelling, visualizing BBB leakage by intravenously administered Evans blue albumin, and determining neutrophil infiltration with light microscopy. Cerebral blood flow, monitored by laser-Doppler flowmetry in separate experiments, was similar among pharmacological treatments. Ischemic swelling resulted in increased hemispheric volume of 13.4%+/-1.0% in controls, 8.1%+/-0.4% (39% reduction) after cromoglycate, and 25.2%+/-2.0% (89% increase) after compound 48/80 (P<0.05). Early ischemic BBB leakage was reduced by 51% after cromoglycate, and 50% enhanced by compound 48/80 (P<0.05). The cromoglycate group showed 37% less postischemic neutrophil infiltration than did controls (P<0.05). Furthermore, MC-deficient rats responded to focal ischemia with 58% less brain swelling (6.7%+/-1.2%) than did their WT littermates (15.8%+/-1.4%, P<0.05). Blood-brain barrier damage was 47% lower in MC-deficient rats than in the WT (P<0.05). Neutrophil infiltration after MCAO was decreased 47% in MC-deficient rats in comparison to WT (P<0.05). Pharmacological MC inhibition thus appears to deserve further investigation regarding reduction of brain swelling and inflammation early after stroke.
