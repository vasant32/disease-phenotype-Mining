To study the distribution of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) in the rat brain under physiological as well as pathological conditions, a sensitive sandwich enzyme linked immunoassay (EIA) for rat CNTF was developed using rabbit anti-CNTF antibody. This method detected as little as 10 pg ml-1 CNTF with a good linearity and accuracy. Analysis of various regions of rat brain and peripheral nerves showed a high content of CNTF in the sciatic nerves, spinal cord, optic nerves, and olfactory bulb. Transient focal ischemia of rat brain caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion significantly and specifically increased CNTF levels in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus regions in the ischemic hemisphere.
