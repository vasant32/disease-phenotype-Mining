A novel transient middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion model in the rat was used to evaluate the effect of nimodipine on brain edema and mortality. Nimodipine (30 micrograms/kg) administered immediately after 3 hr of transient unilateral MCA occlusion attenuated significantly the post-ischemic increase of tissue water content and partly attenuated 45Ca accumulation in the parieto-temporal cortex ipsilateral to the left MCA occlusion 3 hr after reperfusion. Nimodipine decreased the mortality rate at 6 and 9 hr after recirculation, although the survival rate at 24 hr after recirculation was not different from the control group. These results suggest that nimodipine has beneficial effects in the early phase of the reperfusion period.
