The feline right cerebral hemisphere was subjected to regional (incomplete) ischemia after clipping the middle cerebral artery for 5, 10, 15, 30 or 60 min, respectively. After each ischemic episode, a 10-min recirculation period was allowed, following which the brain was fixed and processed for electron microscopy. The earliest alterations, detected in the cerebral cortex after 15 min, increased in severity with longer ischemic episodes and were distributed multifocally. There was: (a) marked neuronal mitochondrial matrical swelling and progressive condensation of cytoplasm and nucleoplasm; (b) cytoplasmic swelling of astrocytes with preservation of glial mitochondrial volume; (c) capillaries, oligodendrocytes, myelin sheaths and axis cylinders did not change significantly, even after the longest interval studied: 60 min. This type of tissue reaction appears to be common for those forms of cerebral ischemia, in which circulation is either sustained partially (via collateral arteries) or restored after a period of absolute ischemia. Under these conditions, as yet undefined permeability changes in cell membranes lead to pronounced volumetric alterations of cellular compartments. Although no softening is detectable by digital examination, we suggest that such a set of structural abnormalities constitutes encephalomalacia, or the earliest stage of a lesion which is designated infarction, once it reaches irreversibility.
