In the present study, we have examined the expression of both presenilins in the rat hippocampus, cortex, striatum, and cerebellum after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCA-O), an animal model of ischemia. The cortex showed the greatest increase in PS mRNA levels (7-10-fold) at 4 and 8 days posttreatment. Presenilin-1 (PS-1) levels in the contralateral cortex were significantly increased 1 day after MCA-O. In comparison, PS mRNA content was only modestly elevated in the hippocampus and striatum at 4 and 8 days after MCA-O (30-100% changes). Other Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related genes, amyloid precursor protein and apolipoprotein E, are induced in brain injury suggesting that these AD-related genes may well be components of a brain-injury response. Thus, a breakdown in this response via cerebrovascular disease and/or genetic mutation may contribute to AD pathology.
