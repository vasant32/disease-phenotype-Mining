Cannabinoids protect cortical neurons from ischemic injury by interacting with CB1 receptors. Because a variety of neuroprotective genes are induced in cerebral ischemia, we examined the effect of experimental stroke, produced by 20 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats, on CB1 receptor expression. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry showed that CB1 expression on neurons was increased in the arterial boundary zone of the cortical mantle, beginning by 2 hours and persisting for 72 hours or more after ischemia These findings are consistent with a neuroprotective role for endogenous cannabinoid signaling pathways and with a potential therapeutic role in stroke for drugs that activate CB1 receptors.
