We tested the therapeutic effect of autologous transplanted bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) on cerebral ischemia in rabbits. Rabbit permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) models were intravenously injected with ex vivo expanded autologous BMSCs (n = 8), EPCs (n = 8), or phosphate-buffered saline (n = 6). 14 days after the transplantation, both infusion groups witnessed a functional improvement, a decrease in the number of apoptotic cells and an increase in the microvessel density in the ischemic boundary area, as compared to vehicle-treated control group. The EPCs treated group also exhibited a diminished infarct area in comparison with the control group. Moreover, immunohistochemistry revealed that few transplanted BMSCs expressed markers for astrocytes (GFAP+) and neurons (NeuN+), and most of EPCs were capable of binding to UEA-1 lectin and were incorporated into capillaries. Our data suggest that both BMSCs and EPCs, despite differences in their action mechanism, can be functional cytoreagents for treatment of cerebral ischemia in rabbits.
