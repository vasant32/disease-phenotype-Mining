OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relation between protein expression changes in the cerebellum and improvement of motor coordination in rats with cerebral infarction. DESIGN: The rat group with treadmill training (n = 10) were compared with the rat group without treadmill training (n = 10) after 2.5 hrs of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Motor performance measured by the rotarod test and alteration of protein expression using two-dimensional electrophoresis based on proteomics in the cerebellum were examined. RESULTS: In behavioral evaluation, the mean latency until falling from the rotating rod in the group with treadmill training was significantly longer (P < 0.01) than that in the group without treadmill training 24 days after surgery. As for protein expression, it was revealed by proteome analysis and Western blotting that the expression of the two protein spots, 25-kDa synaptosomal-associated protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein, were significantly enhanced in the cerebellum of rats with treadmill training than that in rats without a treadmill training. CONCLUSIONS: The 25-kDa synaptosomal-associated protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein may be related to the underlying mechanisms of improvement of motor coordination and exercise-induced angiogenesis, that is, remodeling of synaptic connections and proliferation of astroglial cells, respectively.
