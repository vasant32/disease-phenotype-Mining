 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Systemic administration of cytosine-guanine (CpG) oligodeoxynucleotides provides neuroprotection against subsequent cerebral ischemic injury. We examined the genomic response of leukocytes and brain cells after ischemia in the context of CpG preconditioning. METHODS: RNA was isolated from circulating leukocytes and ischemic cortex 3 and 24 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion after CpG or saline pretreatment and subjected to microarray analysis. Genes uniquely upregulated in CpG-pretreated mice were examined for overrepresented transcriptional regulatory elements. RESULTS: CpG preconditioning induced a novel response to middle cerebral artery occlusion within circulating leukocytes that was dominated by natural killer cell-associated genes and the GATA-3 transcriptional regulatory element. Preconditioning also caused a novel brain response to stroke that was dominated by Type I interferon, interferon-associated genes, and transcriptional regulatory elements. CONCLUSIONS: CpG preconditioning invokes novel leukocyte and brain responses to stroke. In this, CpG may be a unique preconditioning agent, coordinating peripheral and brain responses to protect against ischemic injury.
