 BACKGROUND AIMS: This study aimed to observe nine factors expressed in rat ischemic brain after transplantation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) and/or endothelial progenitor cells (EPC). These factors were vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-l), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF). METHODS: Adult Wistar rats were divided randomly into four groups: a vehicle group, BMSC group, EPC group and BMSC combined with EPC group. The rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) then implanted intravenously with 3 × 10(6) BMSC, EPC, BMSC/EPC or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 24 h after MCAO. Neurologic functional deficits were measured on days 1, 7, 14, 28 after transplantation. On day 7 after transplantation, quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot were employed to detect the expression of VEGF, SDF-1, bFGF, IGF-l, TGF-β, PDGF-BB, BDNF, GDNF and NGF. RESULTS: The neurologic evaluation found that the neurologic severity scores were no different between the four groups on day 1, and the scores of rats in the BMSC/EPC group were significantly lower than those of rats in the other groups on days 7, 14 and 28 after transplantation. The expressions of bFGF, VEGF and BNDF were significantly higher in the BMSC/EPC group compared with the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: The intravenous transplantation of BMSC combined with EPC could promote the functional rehabilitation of rats with focal cerebral ischemia, and the mechanism may be related to the enhanced expression of factors.
