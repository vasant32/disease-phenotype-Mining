Preparations of I(125)-labeled monoclonal antibodies against neurospecific enolase and mouse plasma IgG1 were injected intravenously to rats immediately after unilateral occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Radioactivity of I(125)-labeled monoclonal antibodies against neurospecific enolase in the brain tissue progressively increased, reached a maximum by the 48th hour, and remained practically unchanged after 72 h. At the same time radioactivity of labeled IgG1 in the brain tissue and radioactivity of both preparations in the blood, liver, spleen, kidneys, heart, and lungs decreased over 72 h. Selective accumulation of I(125)-labeled monoclonal antibodies against neurospecific enolase was less significant in the brain tissue of the contralateral hemisphere and cerebellum not exposed to ischemia.
