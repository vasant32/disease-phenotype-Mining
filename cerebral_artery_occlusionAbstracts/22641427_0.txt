Stroke is a leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity, economic and social burden and mortality. Novel approaches are needed to address stroke prevention and treatment. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of aloe polysaccharide on caspase-3 expression following cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury in rats. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups (16 rats in each group): aloe polysaccharide, ginkgo leaf tablet, nimodipine, model and sham surgery groups. The rats were administered the appropriate drug or normal saline for 7 days by gavage. A rat model of cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury was established using the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. Caspase-3 protein and mRNA expression levels in the cerebral cortex were detected by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively. Results showed that caspase-3 protein and mRNA expression levels in the cerebral cortex in the aloe polysaccharide, ginkgo leaf tablet and nimodipine groups were significantly lower compared with the model group and were higher than the sham surgery group (P<0.05). No significant difference was observed in caspase-3 protein and mRNA expression among the aloe polysaccharide, the ginkgo leaf tablet and the nimodipine groups (P>0.05). In conclusion, aloe polysaccharide has a protective effect on cerebral ischemia that may be due to the inhibition of neuronal cell apoptosis.
