We determined the role of VEGF-transfected neural stem cells (NSCs) transplantation in rat brain subjected to ischemia. Fetal NSCs were cultured from E14 days SD rats and transfected with VEGF121 gene by using lipofectamine technique. Temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) models were established and randomly divided into 1: control group, 2: PBS transplantation group, 3: NSCs transplantation group and 4: VEGF-secreting NSCs transplantation group. Grafts were transplanted into the penumbra zones 3 days after tMCAO model established. Neurological Severity Score (NSS) was checked in all groups 2-12 weeks after transplantation. By using immunofluorescent staining, VEGF expression of transplanted cells, differentiation and migration of transplanted NSCs after transplantation were detected. VEGF gene-transfected neural stem cells expressed gene products during the first 2 weeks. NSS in this group was significantly lower compared with that in other 3 groups 12 weeks after transplantation. VEGF gene-transfected NSCs migrated and expressed VEGF in hosts' brains, some of them differentiated to neurons 12 weeks after transplantation. VEGF-transfected NSCs expressed gene products during the early time after transplantation, which reduce brain injury through protecting the vascular system against ischemic attack.
