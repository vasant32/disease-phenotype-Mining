This study investigated the possible involvement of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the therapeutic effect of cerebral ischemia by electro-acupuncture (EA) using the rat model with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). By immunohistochemistry, the changes of GABA expression level in the primary infarct area and its penumbral regions were examined. The changes in infarct area and survival neuron percentages were also assessed using haematoxylin and eosin stained sections after picrotoxin (PTX) injection, a GABA receptor's antagonist. Our results showed that EA markedly decreased the ischemic damaged areas in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Concomitant to this was an up-regulation of GABA immunoexpression in MCAO rats with EA treatment (P < 0.05). Furthermore, injection of PTX in rats subjected to MCAO or MCAO followed by EA treatment increased the infarct area and decreased survival cell percentage significantly when compared with those without PTX injection. In the light of these findings, it is suggested that EA on specific and established acupoints that are commonly used in clinical management of cerebral ischemia may have elicited an up-regulated expression of GABA that would have a neuroprotective effect.
