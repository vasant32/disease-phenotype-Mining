Although middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in the rat is often used to study focal cerebral ischemia, the model of ischemia affects the size and reproducibility of infarction. The purpose of this experiment was to methodically examine different preparations to determine the optimum focal cerebral ischemia model to produce a reproducible severe ischemic injury. Eighty-two Wistar rats underwent either 1 hour, 3 hour, or permanent MCA occlusion combined with no, unilateral, or bilateral common carotid artery artery (CCA) occlusion. Three days after ischemia, the animals were prepared for tetrazolium chloride assessment of infarction size. One-hour MCA occlusion produced a coefficient of variation (CV) of 200% with an infarction volume of 20.3+/-10.5 mm(3). Adding unilateral or bilateral CCA occlusion resulted in a CV of 134% and 101%, respectively. Three-hour MCA occlusion combined with bilateral CCA occlusion decreased the CV to 58% with a cortical infarction volume of 82.6+/-12.1 mm(3), P<05, compared with 1-hour MCA occlusion with or without CCA occlusion. Permanent MCA occlusion combined with 3 hours of bilateral CCA occlusion resulted in a CV of 47% with a cortical infarction volume of 89.6+/-16.0 mm(3). These results indicate that 3-hour MCA occlusion combined with bilateral CCA occlusion provide consistently a large infarction volume after temporary focal cerebral ischemia.
