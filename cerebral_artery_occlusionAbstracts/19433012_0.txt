OBJECTIVES: This study was carried out to observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on neurological deficits, proliferation and differentiation of nerve stem cells (NSCs) in adult rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and to study its possible role in the treatment of cerebral ischemic injury. METHODS: A rat model of MCAO was established and interfered with EA. On days 4, 7, 14 and 21 after ischemic injury, neurological deficits were scored. On days 4, 7, 14 and 21 after injury, effect of EA interference on the proliferation and differentiation of rat NSCs was observed with BrdU/NeuN and BrdU/GFAP immunofluorescence double labeling. RESULTS: A significant difference was found in the scores of rat neurological deficits between the EA and model groups 7, 14 and 21 days after cerebral ischemic injury (p<0.05). BrdU positive cells were found in the subventricular zone (SVZ) 4, 7, 14 and 21 days after ischemic injury. The number of positive BrdU cells in the SVZ reached its peak 7 days after injury and was greater in the EA group than in the model group 7 and 14 days after injury (p<0.05). The number of BrdU/GFAP doubly labeled positive cells in the SVZ was greater in the EA group than in the model group 7 and 14 days after ischemic injury (p=0.012 and p=0.025, respectively). There was no difference in the number of BrdU/NeuN doubly labeled positive cells 4, 7 and 14 days in the striatum, but a significant difference 21 days (p=0.033) after ischemic injury between the two groups. DISCUSSION: Cerebral ischemic injury induces proliferation of NSCs, some of which will differentiate into both astroglia and neurons. EA may promote cells proliferation, stimulate the proliferating cells to differentiate into astroglia and mature into neurons, which may be one of the important reasons why EA can alleviate neurological deficits.
