To understand the fates of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) following transplantation into a rodent model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques were employed, hMSCs were labeled with ferumoxides (Feridex)--protamine sulfate complexes, which were visualized and examined by MRI up to 10 weeks following transplantation. Migration of the transplanted cells to the infarcted area was further confirmed by histological methods. We found that the hMSCs transplanted in MCAo models possess the capacity to migrate to the infarcted area extensively in both ipsilateral and contralateral injections, exhibiting a pathotropism. We also analyzed the detailed migration patterns of transplanted hMSCs. We speculate that the extensive migratory ability of hMSCs may represent a therapeutic potential for developing efficient cell transplantation strategies in stroke.
