 AIM: To investigate the effects of adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC) transplanting on the outgrowth of neuronal axons and the expressions of GFAP, Neuritin, NF-200 in the brain post focal cerebral ischemia in rats. METHODS: 54 male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: sham-operated group, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group and MCAO+ADSC-treated group (n=18 in each group). A permenant focal cerebal ischemia model was established using modified Longa's method ADSC was labeled by DAPI before the transplantation. One day after MCAO, 30 μL of cell suspension containing 1×10(6); cells were injected into the lateral ventricle of MCAO+ADSC-treated group. At 7 d, 14 d and 28 d after MCAO, the expressions of GFAP, Neuritin and NF-200 were detected in ischemic region by Western blot and Immunofluorescence analysis. RESULTS: DAPI staining positive cells were observed around the cerebral infarcted area in the ADSC group. The expressions of Neuritin, NF200 were higher, but GFAP was lower than that of the MCAO group at 7 d, 14 d and 28 d (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The transplantation of ADSC can induce regeneration and repairment of impaired neuronal axons in rat brain after cerebral ischemia, partly by inhibiting the expression of GFAP and enhancing the expressions of Neuritin, NF-200 in the brain.
