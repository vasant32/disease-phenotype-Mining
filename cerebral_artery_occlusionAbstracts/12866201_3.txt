Functional recovery by the application of electro-acupuncture (EA) on different acupoints was investigated using a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in rat. Acupoints were Baihui (D20) plus Renzhong (D26) (MCAO + D group), and Hanyan (G4), Xuanlu (G5), Xuanli (G6), plus Qubin (G7) (MCAP + G group). Animals with EA treatment showed significant functional improvements from 12 days after the reperfusion against those without EA treatment. Among EA treated groups, MCAO + G showed a more significant recovery than MCAO + D. Infarct volume revealed the significant reduction in the EA treated groups especially in MCAO + G at 30 days. Immunohistochemical study showed a remarkable induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in astrocytes of the peri-infarct area at 30 days, more in EA treated groups than in groups treated with MCAO alone. These results suggest that the acupoints applied in this study are effective for the functional recovery, and an enhanced expression of VEGF may play a certain role in recovery process after stroke.
