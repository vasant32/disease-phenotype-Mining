1. NBPA is a derivative of 3-n-butylpathalide isolated from Apium granolens Linn. 2. At concentrations ranging from 6 x 10(-6) to 10(-6) mol/L, NBPA inhibited the L-type calcium current in guinea-pig myocardial cells and cultured human neuroblastoma cells. 3. At 10(-6) mol/L, NBPA markedly inhibited calcium-dependent and -independent release of glutamate from synaptosomes. 4. The [31P] nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum has shown that pretreatment with NBPA at 15 mg/kg, i.p., improved energy metabolism. 5. In situ hybridization has shown that 10 and 20 mg/kg, i.p., NBPA prior to cerebral artery occlusion can accelerate the expression of heat shock protein 70 mRNA and inhibit c-fos mRNA expression. 6. It has been shown that NBPA decreases the nitric oxide content and bc nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity in the global cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion model in rats. In addition, it has been shown that NBPA significantly inhibits the expression of inducible NOS protein.
