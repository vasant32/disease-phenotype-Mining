Appropriate restoration of blood flow via angiogenesis is critical for the recovery from ischemic stroke. Previously, we reported that treatment with dl-3n-butylphthalide (NBP) increases the number of local potent cerebral microvessels. However, the underlying mechanism remained unclear. The present study was conducted to test whether NBP enhances post-ischemic cerebral angiogenesis via vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia induced factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha). Stroke-prone renovascular hypertensive rats (RHRSP) were used to create middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. NBP was given 80 mg/kg per d for 10 consecutive days, starting 12, 24, 48 and 72 h respectively after MCAO. Neurological function was assessed daily and infarct volume as well as the expressions of CD31, VEGF, HIF-1 alpha and bFGF was detected 13 days after MCAO. The administration of NBP starting within 24 h after MCAO enhanced recovery of neurobehavioral function, reduced infarct volume, increased the quantity of CD31 positive vessels, and up-regulated expressions of VEGF and HIF-1 alpha. These findings suggest that treatment with NBP within 24 h post-ischemic stroke rescues brain tissue by enhancing angiogenesis associated with up-regulation of VEGF and HIF-1 alpha expressions.
