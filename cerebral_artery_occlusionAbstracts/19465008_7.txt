Age is a primary risk factor in stroke that is often overlooked in animal studies. We contend that using aged animals yields insight into aspects of stroke injury and recovery that are masked, or not elicited, in younger animals. In this study, we examined effects of co-administration of a plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 derived peptide, Glu-Glu-Iso-Iso-Met-Asp (EEIIMD), with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) on infarct volume and functional outcome in aged rats following a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Results of our study showed aged (18-20 months) rats treated with EEIIMD along with tPA had reduced cortical infarction volume. However, aged rats showed no improvement in total infarction volume, edema formation, or functional outcome as compared to aged rats administered only tPA. Young adult rats (3-4 months) treated with EEIIMD showed significant improvement in cortical and total infarction volumes, edema formation, and functional outcome. Striatal infarction volume was unaffected by EEIIMD treatment in both young adult and aged rats. These findings emphasize that physiological differences exist between young adult and aged rats and suggest that taking aging processes into account when assessing stroke may improve our ability to discern which therapeutics can be translated from bench to bedside.
