The expression of the mRNA of four members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor family, was examined in rats subjected to temporal middle cerebral artery occlusion using an in situ hybridization technique. Fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR-1) mRNA was strongly expressed in neurons of the cerebral cortex, whereas mRNAs of the other 3 subtypes of FGFRs (FGFR-2, -3, and -4) were not expressed. After temporal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, expression of FGFR-1 mRNA in cerebral cortical neurons markedly increased in association with the progressive neuronal death; this increase was evident for at least 5 days after the focal ischemia. In view of the neuroprotective activity of basic FGF reported so far, the present results suggest that FGFR-1 induction may subserve to self-protect neurons in the ischemic penumbral field of the cerebral cortex.
