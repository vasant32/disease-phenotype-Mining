The effect of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion on the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) mRNA expression has been investigated using in situ hybridization. It was induced in the extensive regions of cerebral cortex, medial striatum, and distant areas such as the ipsilateral lateral septal nucleus, bilateral hippocampal formation and contralateral amygdala following MCA occlusion. In the hippocampal formation, it was induced in the granule cell layer and the stratum pyramidale at 1 h and in the molecular layer and in the stratum oriens and stratum radiatum bilaterally at 4 h. MK-801 pretreatment strongly attenuated the induction of Arc mRNA. The present results suggest that Arc may play an important role in the neuronal plasticity through NMDA activation following focal cerebral ischemia.
