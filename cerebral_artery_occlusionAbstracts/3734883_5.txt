Knowledge of the natural course of stroke patients has become increasingly important since new therapeutic methods have been proposed for patients with cerebral infarction in the acute stage. In order to clarify the acute stage of this disease, 188 patients admitted within 24 hours after onset of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion were followed for 2 months, and data relating to mortality and changes in disturbances of consciousness and motor function were investigated. It was shown that the prognosis for MCA occlusion cases is poor, and about 80% of these patients are unable to return to their previous lifestyle. The level of consciousness in the acute stage is a good index for estimating the patients' quality and time of survival, and motor function in the acute stage is a good indicator of functional recovery. Thus, when evaluating the effectiveness of a new therapy for cerebral infarction, rapid improvement in the acute stage before and after treatment should be carefully noted.
