Middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in rats induced c-fos and junB mRNA 4h later in all ipsilateral cortex outside the MCA distribution and in many subcortical structures: medial striatum; most of thalamus including medial and lateral geniculate nuclei: substantia nigra; and hippocampus. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, MK-801 (4 mg/kg, i.p.) inhibited c-fos and junB mRNA induction in the cortex, striatum, thalamus, and hippocampus but not in the substantia nigra. These data show that c-fos and junB mRNA induction in cortex, striatum, thalamus, hippocampus involves the activation of NMDA receptors whereas different receptors must be implicated in the induction in substantia nigra.
