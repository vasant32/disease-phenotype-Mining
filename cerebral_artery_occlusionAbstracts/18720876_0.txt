OBJECTIVE: To study the protective effects of Shexiang Xingnaonin (SXN) on focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury and its mechanism. METHOD: Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was used to make focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion model by in travascular nylon filament occlusion. The protective effects of SXN at different doses were evaluated by investigating neurological function score, pathomorphology of brain, the ultrastructure of neuron, expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, thrombogenesis in vitro, platelet aggregation and lysing effect of blood clot in vitro. RESULT: Compared with model group, SXN (0.08, 0.16 g x kg(-1)) could decrease the neurological score, improve pathomorphology and neuron ultrastructure of brain, inhibit the expression of TNF-alpha, decrease the length, wet weight and dry weight of thromb and inhibit platelet aggregation. And SXN (0.16, 0.32 g x L(-1)) could dissolve blood clot in vitro. CONCLUSION: SXN has protective effects on focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. The role of inhibit the expression of TNF-alpha, inhibit thrombogenesis and platelet aggregation might contribute to its neuroprotective effects.
