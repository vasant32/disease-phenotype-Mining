In a transient 90-min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of rats, a large ischemic lesion is formed where macrophage-like cells massively accumulate, many of which express a macrophage marker, Iba1, and an oligodendrocyte progenitor cell marker, NG2 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (NG2); therefore, the cells were termed BINCs (Brain Iba1(+)/NG2(+) Cells). A bone marrow transplantation experiment using green-fluorescent protein-transgenic rats showed that BINCs were derived from bone marrow. 5-Fluorouracil (5FU) injection at 2 days post reperfusion (2 dpr) markedly reduced the number of BINCs at 7 dpr, causing enlargement of necrotic volumes and frequent death of the rats. When isolated BINCs were transplanted into 5FU-aggravated ischemic lesion, the volume of the lesion was much reduced. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR showed that BINCs expressed mRNAs encoding bFGF, BMP2, BMP4, BMP7, GDNF, HGF, IGF-1, PDGF-A, and VEGF. In particular, BINCs expressed IGF-1 mRNA at a very high level. Immunohistochemical staining showed that IGF-1-expressing BINCs were found not only in rat but also human ischemic brain lesions. These results suggest that bone marrow-derived BINCs play a beneficial role in ischemic brain lesions, at least in part, through secretion of neuroprotective factors.
