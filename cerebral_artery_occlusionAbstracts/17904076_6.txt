BACKGROUND: This study was designed to develop a simple, reversible primate middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion (MCAO) model. METHODS: MCAO was achieved by inserting a specially designed intraluminal balloon catheter from the external carotid artery, then to the internal carotid artery, and finally into the proximal segment of MCA using 13 adolescent monkeys (Macaca mulatta) weighing 4.25 +/- 0.23 kg. The infarction was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging at 3, 7, and 23 hours after MCAO. RESULTS: Local cerebral blood flow in the caudate nucleus decreased remarkably. Post-MCAO electroencephalographic monitoring showed the inhibition of electroencephalography with slow waves distinctly increasing. Neurologic evaluation demonstrated persistent deficits in the ischemic group. Neuropathologic examinations were consistent with the neurologic evaluations. CONCLUSION: The results suggested that this reversible monkey model resembled a human stroke and should offer a reasonable alternative to craniotomy and the extrinsic ligation of the MCA in the laboratory investigation of focal reversible cerebral ischemia.
