The distant heat induced by suspended moxibustion (SM) for 40 min is confirmed to have a favorable effect in treating diseases such as ischemic brain injury in the clinical setting, but its precise mechanism remains to be explained. Since a similar reaction to the phenomenon of distant heat is found in some transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) rats treated by a 40-min SM session with tail temperature increase (TTI), we hereby study its mechanism by comparing the neuroprotective effect of 40 min's SM with TTI to those without. The experimental results show that 40 min's SM with TTI can significantly reduce the infarct volume and neurological deficit score in tMCAO rats. Western blot demonstrates that a reduction in the levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in tMCAO rats with TTI is more striking than that of the rats without TTI. The expression of caspase-3 protein is inhibited in tMCAO rats with TTI. The results suggest that the efficacy of SM for 40 min with TTI is higher than that without. Although neuroprotective effects present in tMCAO rats with and without TTI, those with TTI revealed a higher level of anti-inflammation effect and exhibited an anti-apoptosis effect.
