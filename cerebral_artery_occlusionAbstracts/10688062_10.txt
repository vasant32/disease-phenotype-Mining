Proteins of the bcl-2 family are important regulators of apoptosis in many tissues of the embryo and adult and may play a role in cell death following stroke. The recently isolated bcl-w gene encodes a pro-survival member of the bcl-2 family, which is widely expressed. However, it is not known whether bcl-w plays a role in determining cell survival after cerebral ischemia. Using Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry, regional bcl-w protein expression was studied in rat brain 2, 6, 24 and 72 h following 20 min temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Focal cerebral ischemia increased bcl-w protein expression within the caudate putamen and parietal cortex, as well as causing milder increases within frontal cortex. Immunocytochemically bcl-w was expressed within neurons (frontal and parietal cortex) and glia (caudate putamen) 24 h after MCAO. These data suggest that bcl-w could play a role in determining cell survival after cerebral ischemia.
