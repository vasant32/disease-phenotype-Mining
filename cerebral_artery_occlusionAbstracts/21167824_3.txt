Little is known about the relationship between neuronal cell transplantation and endogenous neurogenesis after experimental stroke. We found previously that transplantation of neuronal precursors derived from BG01 human embryonic stem cells reduced infarct volume and improved behavioral outcome after distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. In this study, transplantation was performed 14 days after distal MCAO and doublecortin (Dcx)-expressing cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and subgranular zone of dentate gyrus (SGZ) were counted 60 days post-transplant. Transplantation increased neurogenesis (Dcx expression) in ipsilateral SVZ, but not in contralateral SVZ or either SGZ, in both young adult (3-month-old) and aged (24-month-old) rats. These findings suggest that cell-based therapy for stroke may be associated with changes in endogenous adaptive processes, including neurogenesis.
