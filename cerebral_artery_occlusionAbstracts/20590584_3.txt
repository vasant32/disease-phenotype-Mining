 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although microsomal prostaglandin E synthase (mPGES)-1 is known to contribute to stroke injury, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study examines the hypothesis that EP(3) receptors contribute to stroke injury as downstream effectors of mPGES-1 neurotoxicity through Rho kinase activation. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We used a glutamate-induced excitotoxicity model in cultured rat and mouse hippocampal slices and a mouse middle cerebral artery occlusion-reperfusion model. Effects of an EP(3) receptor antagonist on neuronal damage in mPGES-1 knockout (KO) mice was compared with that in wild-type (WT) mice. KEY RESULTS: In cultures of rat hippocampal slices, the mRNAs of EP(1-4) receptors were constitutively expressed and only the EP(3) receptor antagonist ONO-AE3-240 attenuated and only the EP(3) receptor agonist ONO-AE-248 augmented glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in CA1 neurons. Hippocampal slices from mPGES-1 KO mice showed less excitotoxicity than those from WT mice and the EP(3) receptor antagonist did not attenuate the excitotoxicity. In transient focal ischaemia models, injection (i.p.) of an EP(3) antagonist reduced infarction, oedema and neurological dysfunction in WT mice, but not in mPGES-1 KO mice, which showed less injury than WT mice. EP(3) receptor agonist-induced augmentation of excitotoxicity in vitro was ameliorated by the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 and Pertussis toxin. The Rho kinase inhibitor HA-1077 also ameliorated stroke injury in vivo. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Activity of mPGES-1 exacerbated stroke injury through EP(3) receptors and activation of Rho kinase and/or G(i). Thus, mPGES-1 and EP(3) receptors may be valuable therapeutic targets for treatment of human stroke.
