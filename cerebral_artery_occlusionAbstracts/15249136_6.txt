Myelencephalon-specific protease (MSP) is one of the serine proteases and is expressed in the central nervous system of rats. Its function and alternation in brain injury have not yet been clarified. In this study, we investigated the expression of MSP after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. In situ localization of MSP mRNA demonstrated a higher level in the corpus callosum and around the ischemic area from 12 h to 14 days after MCA reperfusion, with the peak of expression coming 3 days after reperfusion in both regions. Immunohistochemically, the expression of protein was found 1 day after reperfusion in the same brain region that was observed for mRNA. The peak was 7 days after reperfusion in both regions. Micro-autoradiography, immunostaining and double immunohistochemical labeling revealed the expression of MSP to be located mainly in the oligodendrocytes. The present results indicate that MSP may be related to the turnover of the myelin-associated proteins and the extracellular matrix proteins after transient MCAO. The activation of MSP may play a role in remodeling processes such as neurite outgrowth and remyelination.
