In animal cerebral infarct experiments, the most important aspect is to produce consistent infarct size and localization. In an attempt to improve the conventional middle cerebral artery (MCA) coagulation technique, we developed a new animal model using a microclip to reduce variability in infarct size. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to right MCA occlusion. The animals were divided into two groups; conventional MCA occlusion group (Group 1; n = 9) and modified clip occlusion group (Group 2; n = 9). In Group 2, the proximal portion of MCA was occluded by applying a small clip just proximal to the olfactory nerve, and the MCA from the clipped position to the position just proximal to the level of the inferior cerebral vein was electrocoagulated using a bipolar diathermy in the same manner as in Group 1. In other words, the only difference between these two groups was the manner of occlusion of the most proximal portion of the MCA. Rats were killed 24 hours after the stroke-inducing surgery, and infarct volume was determined by an image analysis program following staining with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride. The cortical infarct volumes were 51.0 +/- 13.8% in Group 1 and 46.3 +/- 6.2% in Group 2. The scattering of cortical infarct volume was significantly small in Group 2 (p=0.0176). The differences in scattering of striatal and total infarct volumes did not reach statistical significance. The present results demonstrated that the new MCA occlusion model using a clip significantly reduces the variability in cortical infarct volume, solving the problems of the model using coagulation alone. That permanent MCA occlusion model using a clip is an excellent method that produces more consistent and reproducible infarction.
