OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 during focal cerebral ischemia. METHODS: Left middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was undergone after the introduction of a nylon suture to the left internal carotid artery in 70 male adult CD-1 mice. ERK 1/2 phosphorylation was detected using Western blot analysis, and the morphological feature was determined by immunohistochemistry. An ERK pathway inhibitor, 1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis[2-amino-phenylthio] butadiene (U0126), was administered intravenously 20 minutes before MCAO, and the neurological deficit levels and the infarct volumes were measured 24 hours after MCAO. RESULTS: Phosphorylated ERK 1/2 (pERK 1/2) activity increased after 30 minutes of MCAO and peaked at 2 hours. The immunohistochemical study displayed a large number of pERK 1/2 positive cells in the ischemic basal ganglion and surrounding cortex. Double-labeled fluorescent staining identified the pERK1/2 positive cells as neurons or astrocytes. In U0126 treated mice which had undergone 24 hours of MCAO, the neurological deficit levels and the infarct volumes were 44.6% and 45.8% respectively, less than those of the control mice. CONCLUSIONS: ERK plays an important role in focal cerebral ischemia and inhibition of the ERK pathway can help protect against ischemic brain injury, which may provide a therapeutic approach for cerebral ischemia.
