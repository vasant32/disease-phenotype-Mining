BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neuroprotection with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) requires direct injection into the brain owing to poor transport of the neurotrophin through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vivo. The present studies investigate whether BDNF alone or conjugated to a BBB drug targeting system is neuroprotective in focal, reversible brain ischemia after delayed intravenous administration at 60 or 120 minutes after middle cerebral arterial occlusion. METHODS: BDNF was conjugated to the OX26 murine monoclonal antibody to the rat transferrin receptor, which undergoes transport into brain from blood via the BBB transferrin receptor transcytosis system. After a 1-hour occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in nitrous oxide- ventilated animals with normal blood sugar, the brain was reperfused, and either BDNF or the BDNF/OX26 conjugate was administered as a single intravenous injection at a dose of 50 microg per rat. RESULTS: After the intravenous administration of unconjugated BDNF, there was no neuroprotection on the basis of analysis of brain at either 24 hours or 7 days after a 1-hour middle cerebral arterial occlusion. In contrast, there was a 68% and 70% reduction in cortical stroke volume at 24 hours and 7 days, respectively, after intravenous administration of 50 microg per rat of the BDNF conjugate (P<0.01). No effects on subcortical stroke volume were observed. CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate marked neuroprotection in focal, transient brain ischemia with a single, delayed intravenous injection of BDNF if the neurotrophin is conjugated to a BBB drug targeting system. The neuroprotection is long lasting and persists for at least 7 days after a 1-hour middle cerebral artery occlusion.
