Cannabinoid CB(2) Receptor (CB(2)) activation has been shown to have immunomodulatory properties without psychotropic effects. The hypothesis of this study is that selective CB(2) agonist treatment can attenuate cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Selective CB(2) agonists (O-3853, O-1966) were administered intravenously 1 h before transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) or 10 mins after reperfusion in male mice. Leukocyte/endothelial interactions were evaluated before MCAO, 1 h after MCAO, and 24 h after MCAO via a closed cranial window. Cerebral infarct volume and motor function were determined 24 h after MCAO. Administration of the selective CB(2) agonists significantly decreased cerebral infarction (30%) and improved motor function (P<0.05) after 1 h MCAO followed by 23 h reperfusion in mice. Transient ischemia in untreated animals was associated with a significant increase in leukocyte rolling and adhesion on both venules and arterioles (P<0.05), whereas the enhanced rolling and adhesion were attenuated by both selective CB(2) agonists administered either at 1 h before or after MCAO (P<0.05). CB(2) activation is associated with a reduction in white blood cell rolling and adhesion along cerebral vascular endothelial cells, a reduction in infarct size, and improved motor function after transient focal ischemia.
