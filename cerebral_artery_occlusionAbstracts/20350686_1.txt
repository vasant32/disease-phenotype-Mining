Ischemic stroke is typically characterized by the disruption of cerebral blood flow. This study aimed to consecutively evaluate the cerebral blood flow changes in a focal ischemia rat model during the occlusion-reperfusion procedure and along the recovery stage after stroke. In 12 Sprague Dawley (SD) rats, a middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAo/r) surgery was conducted, which combines a permanent occlusion of the right common carotid artery (CCA), external carotid artery (ECA) and a transient occlusion of the right internal carotid artery (ICA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) with a monofilament introduced from the proximal ICA towards the distal right ICA then removed after 90 min. Blood flow velocity (BFV) from the concerned arteries were measured using ultrasonography (13-4 MHz) at the basal stage before the surgery, after the reperfusion stage and during the post-stroke status. At reperfusion stage and after, BFV increased significantly in the left ICA and in the basilar artery (BA) (starting from post-24 h, p < 0.05 vs. basal). Moreover, BFV were reversed in the distal right ICA and reflow was recorded in the right MCA. Time-average maximum BFV in the right MCA at reperfusion and post-stroke 24-96 h was decreased significantly (p < 0.05 vs. basal). The reversed flow in the right ICA was enabled by the settlement of the collateral supply through the circle of Willis which consisted in higher BFV in the opposite ICA and in the BA still 24 h, although the proximal right ICA remain occluded. Ultrasound measurement of BFV helps to provide information on the redistribution of the blood flow supply after the onset of stroke.
