Injury to axons and oligodendrocytes has been poorly characterized in most animal models of stroke, and hence has been difficult to target therapeutically. It is therefore necessary to characterize axonal and oligodendroglial injury in these models, in order to rationally design putative protective compounds that minimize this injury. This study aims to characterize injury to axons and oligodendrocytes in the endothelin-1 (ET-1) model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in conscious rats. Transient forebrain ischemia was induced in conscious adult male Long Evans rats by the perivascular microinjection of ET-1. Quantitative histopathology was performed on forebrain sections at 6, 24, 48 and 72 h after ET-1 administration, using ballistic light analyses and immunohistochemistry for amyloid precursor protein (APP), SMI32, and Tau-1. Ballistic light analyses of cortical and striatal lesions revealed that the infarct volume was maximal in these regions by 6 h. APP and SMI32 immunohistochemistry demonstrated that axonal injury was maximal by 6 h in this model; however, some injured axons appeared to maintain good structural integrity up to 72 h after insult. Density measurements for Tau-1-immunopositive oligodendrocytes were significantly elevated within the corpus callosum from 48 h, but reductions in total oligodendrocyte numbers were not apparent up 72 h after ET-1 injection. These results indicate that axonal and oligodendroglial injury should be investigated as potential targets for delayed therapeutic intervention after MCAO.
