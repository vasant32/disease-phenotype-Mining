Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) has been implicated in the sequence of events leading to neuronal cell death. We have used an ultrasensitive, highly specific immunometric assay for rat IL-1beta to determine the pattern of protein expression in the rat cerebral cortex following middle cerebral artery occlusion. In the ipsilateral cerebral cortex there was a biphasic pattern of production with a rapid early phase of IL-1beta expression followed by a delayed phase at 4 h which was sustained for up to 72 h. There was a similar but smaller expression of IL-1beta in the contralateral cortex. Sham operated animals showed no IL-1beta expression. These results provide further evidence to show that IL-1beta is expressed in the rat cerebral cortex following cerebral ischaemia.
