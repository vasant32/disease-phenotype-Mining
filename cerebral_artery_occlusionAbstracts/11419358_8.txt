A rat model of reversible occlusion of the middle cerebral artery was developed to assess the role of neutrophils and prophylactic hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) on cerebral injury. Blood flow to the ipsilateral caudate putamen nucleus was reduced by approximately 50% during 2 h of arterial occlusion, but unaffected on the contralateral side. Neutrophil accumulation in brain was documented as myeloperoxidase concentration, which was elevated in both ipsilateral and contralateral cerebral hemispheres at 1 and 46 h after occlusion/reperfusion. HBO2 administered before ischemia at 2.8 atm abs for 45 min, as well as antibody-induced neutropenia, reduced neutrophil accumulation, functional neurologic deficits, and cerebral infarct volume. These data demonstrate that one mechanism for benefit of HBO2 is related to its ability to ameliorate post-ischemic injury by inhibiting neutrophil sequestration. This mechanism should be taken into consideration when choosing partial pressures of oxygen for investigational clinical protocols.
