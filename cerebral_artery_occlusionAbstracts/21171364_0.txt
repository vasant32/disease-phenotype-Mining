 AIM: To evaluate N-acetylaspartate reflecting the neuronal lesion in middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion rat by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). METHODS: Sixteen adult Wistar rats with MCAO reperfusion and ten pseudooperation rats were performed MRS in vivo at the sixth weeks, then pathologic examination of HE staining and immunohistochemical staining were made. We compared hippocampus modality, cell density and immunohistochemical results with N-acetylaspartate, creatine changes and ration of NAA/Cr. RESULTS: The values of NAA, Cr and NAA/Cr of ipsilateral hippocampus lesion in MCAO reperfusion rats (2.05 +/- 0.33, 2.42 +/- 0.41 and 0.86 +/- 0.10) were visiblly decreased than contralateral hippocampus (3.45 +/- 0.58, 3.10 +/- 0.93, 1.18 +/- 0.32) and control group (3.42 +/- 0.43, 3.57 +/- 0.47, 0.98 +/- 0.14). But the level of decreased NAA is not corresponding to the degree of neuronal death in ipsilateral region of hippocampus in histochemistry. CONCLUSION: MRS has perfect explanation of cell metabolic changes in CA1 region. Decrease of NAA represented neuron delayed injury. But the decreased level of NAA is not perfectly corresponded to the degree of neuron lost. This change has closed correlation with reactive astrocytes proliferation.
