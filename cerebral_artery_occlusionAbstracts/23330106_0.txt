Mesenchymal stem cells from human placenta obtained after term natural delivery were cultured and labeled with vital dye Dil of magnetic fluorescing microparticles. The labeled cells were transplanted intravenously to rats with occlusion of the median cerebral artery. Penetration of cells through the brain-blood barrier and their distribution in the brain of experimental animals were studied on serial cryostat sections. Two models of cerebral artery occlusion associated with different traumatic consequences were used. The efficiency of crossing the blood-brain barrier by transplanted cells, the number of mesenchymal cells attaining the ischemic focus and neurogenic zones, and the time of death of transplanted cells largely depended on the degree and nature of injury to the central nervous system, which should be taken into account when planning the experiments for evaluation of the effects of cell therapy on the models of neurological diseases and in clinical studies in the field of regenerative neurology.
