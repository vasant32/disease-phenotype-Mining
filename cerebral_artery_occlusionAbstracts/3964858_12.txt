Twenty-three anesthetized cats underwent permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in a study of the relationships of regional cerebral blood flow, ventricular fluid pressure, brain tissue pressure, and ischemic edema formation. A pressure gradient of 8 mm Hg developed between ischemic tissue and normally perfused tissue during a 4-hour observation period after occlusion. Brain water accumulated as tissue pressure rose, while blood flow in the same area fell. The data suggest, but do not prove, that ischemic brain edema causes tissue pressure to rise focally, and that blood flow to the ischemic zone is compromised further by the resultant hydrostatic pressure gradient.
