Neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from human fetal striatum and transplanted as neurospheres survive in stroke-damaged striatum, migrate from the implantation site, and differentiate into mature neurons. Here, we investigated how various steps of neurogenesis are affected by intrastriatal transplantation of human NSCs at different time points after stroke and with different numbers of cells in each implant. Rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion and then received intrastriatal transplants of NSCs. Transplantation shortly after stroke (48 hours) resulted in better cell survival than did transplantation 6 weeks after stroke, but the delayed transplantation did not influence the magnitude of migration, neuronal differentiation, and cell proliferation in the grafts. Transplanting greater numbers of grafted NSCs did not result in a greater number of surviving cells or increased neuronal differentiation. A substantial number of activated microglia was observed at 48 hours after the insult in the injured striatum, but reached maximum levels 1 to 6 weeks after stroke. Our findings show that the best survival of grafted human NSCs in stroke-damaged brain requires optimum numbers of cells to be transplanted in the early poststroke phase, before the inflammatory response is established. These findings, therefore, have direct clinical implications.
