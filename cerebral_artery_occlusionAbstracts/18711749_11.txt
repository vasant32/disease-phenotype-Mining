We tested the hypothesis that a nitric oxide donor, DETA-NONOate, up-regulates stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF1) and angiopoietin 1 (Ang1) in the ischemic brain and their respective receptors chemokine CXC motif receptor 4 (CXCR4) and Tie2 in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and thereby promote SVZ neuroblast cell migration after stroke. C57BL/6J mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo), and 24 hr later DETA-NONOate (0.4 mg/kg) or phosphate-buffered solution was intravenously administered. Mice were sacrificed at 14 days for histological assessment or sacrificed at 3 days for analysis by real-time polymerase chain reaction and migration after MCAo. To elucidate whether SDF1/CXCR4 and Ang1/Tie2 pathways mediate DETA-NONOate-induced SVZ migration after stroke, SDF1alpha, Ang1 peptide, a specific antagonist of CXCR4 (AMD3100), and a neutralizing antibody of Tie2 (anti-Tie2) were used in vitro. DETA-NONOate significantly increased the percentage area of doublecortin (DCX, a marker of migrating neuroblasts)-immunoreactive cells in the SVZ and ischemic boundary zone. DETA-NONOate significantly increased the expression of SDF1 and Ang1 in the ischemic border and up-regulated CXCR4 and Tie2 in the SVZ compared with MCAo control. DCX-positive cell migration from SVZ explants was significantly increased in the DETA-NONOate treatment group compared with MCAo-alone animals. In vitro, SDF1alpha and Ang1 significantly increased SVZ explants cell migration. In addition, inhibition of CXCR4 or Tie2 significantly attenuated DETA-NONOate-induced SVZ cell migration. Our data indicate that treatment of stroke with a nitric oxide donor up-regulates SDF1/CXCR4 and Ang1/Tie2 pathways and thereby likely increases SVZ neuroblast cell migration.
