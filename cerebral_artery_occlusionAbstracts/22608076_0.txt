This study investigated the possible ameliorative effects of adipose-derived stem cells-conditioned medium (ASC-CM) on experimental ischemic stroke. In vivo ischemic stroke was induced in mice after 2h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by 22 h reperfusion. Culture of SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells with 100 Î¼M glutamate for 24h was used as an in vitro neuronal apoptosis model. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of 30- and 100-fold concentrated murine ASC-CM 1h prior to MCAO resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the infarct volume and the brain swelling. The administration of murine ASC-CM immediately after MCAO was also effective, but administration 2h after MCAO was not. Neuroprotective effects of murine ASC-CM were also confirmed in an in vitro model. Pretreatment with 100-fold concentrated murine ASC-CM at 10% of the total culture volume significantly reduced glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in the SH-SY5Y cells. Similar reduction in the MCAO-induced infarction volume was seen following i.c.v. administration of 100-fold concentrated human ASC-CM or murine ASC-CM. In conclusion, ASC-CM appears to exert ameliorative effects on experimental ischemic stroke i\n both in vivo and in vitro models. These findings suggest the feasibility of ASC-CM administration as a therapy for acute stage stroke.
