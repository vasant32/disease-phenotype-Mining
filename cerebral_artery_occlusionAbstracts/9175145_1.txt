We first detected growth-associated protein (GAP-43) immunoreactivity in the neuronal somata following middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat. Four days after the middle cerebral artery occlusion, GAP-43 immunoreactivity was detected in some cortical neurons of the ischemic penumbra at the level of the hippocampus.
