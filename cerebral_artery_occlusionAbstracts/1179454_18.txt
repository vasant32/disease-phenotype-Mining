Blood flow in the hemispheres of baboons three years after middle cerebral artery occlusion has been assessed by the hydrogen clearance technique. Blood flow in the infarct itself varied from very low (8 ml/100 gm per minute) to very high (89 ml/100 gm per minute) values and, averaging the values for the infarct as a whole, it was impossible to distinguish average flows in the infarct from those of the normal hemisphere. Flow values in surrounding zones of the infarct remained significantly lower than those of comparable normal hemispheres, and, excluding the infarct, the mean average hemispheral blood flow was 35.2 ml/100 gm per minute. This indicates a significant reduction in flow in the cortex, subsequently shown histologically to be normal, compared with normal blood flow values for the baboon hemisphere. Autoregulation was lost in the infarct and impaired in surrounding tissue. CO2 reactivity was grossly reduced in the hemisphere as a whole but was present in all areas, even occasionally in electrode placements within the infarct itself. After perfusion fixation of the head, pathological study of the area of infarction showed a fairly consistent distribution, the infarct itself consisting of many dilated blood vessels of non-capillary nature scattered among fibrous tissue in what was virtually a glial scar.
