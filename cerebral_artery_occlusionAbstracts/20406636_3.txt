Age is the most important independent risk factor for stroke; however aging animals are rarely used in stroke studies. Previous work demonstrated that young male mice had more edema formation after an induced stroke than aging animals. An important contributor to cerebral edema formation is the Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC). We examined the expression of NKCC in young (10-12 weeks) and aging (15-16 months) C57BL6 male mice after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and investigated the effect of pharmacological inhibition of NKCC with Bumetanide on cerebral edema formation. Both immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting analysis showed that NKCC expression was significantly higher in the ischemic penumbra of young compared to aging mice after stroke. Edema formation was significantly more robust in young mice and was reduced with Bumetanide. Bumetanide had no effect on cerebral edema in aging mice after MCAO. This suggests that NKCC expression and edema formation are age dependent after ischemic stroke.
