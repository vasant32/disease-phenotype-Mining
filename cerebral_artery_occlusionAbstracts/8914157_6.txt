We reported a case of middle cerebral artery occlusion caused by a dissecting aneurysm that was successfully treated by intra-arterial fibrinolysis. A 38-year-old man suddenly developed left hemiparesis and became confused. He was transferred to our hospital one hour and 27 minutes after the ictus. Right carotid angiogram (CAG) revealed aneurysmal dilatation of the horizontal portion of the middle cerebral artery and occlusion of the anterior trunk. Twelve million IU of tissue plasminogen activator was injected to fibrinolyze the thrombus of the occlusion site through a microcatheter. After this, the patient became alert and hemiparesis disappeared. It took three hours and 30 minutes to gain recanalization after the ictus. Right CAG obtained the next day demonstrated the patency of the anterior trunk and the characteristic finding of the dissecting aneurysm viz "double lumen" as a result of fibrinolysis of the thrombus in the false lumen. Right CAG obtained two weeks later demonstrated "string and pearl sign" instead of the "double lumen" as a result of partial thrombosis in the false lumen. Follow-up CAG obtained nine months after the ictus demonstrated marked reduction of the aneurysmal size as the result of progressing thrombosis of the false lumen. The characteristic angiographic findings of the dissecting aneurysm such as "double lumen" and "string and pearl sign" seemed to be mostly influenced by the status of the thrombus in the false lumen. In case of major cerebral arterial occlusion caused by the embolus or thrombus from the dissecting aneurysm, intra-arterial fibrinolysis seems to be a possible treatment modality, even though it is accompanied by the risk of giving rise to subarachnoid hemorrhage.
