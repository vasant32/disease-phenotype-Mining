Changes of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in cerebrospinal fluid after experimental ischaemic stroke caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion in rat were studied. High enzyme levels were found between the second and seventh day after artery occlusion and they correlated well with the extension of infarct seen in histology. NSE levels in cerebrospinal fluid are sensitive and reliable markers of brain tissue damage during the acute phase of ischaemic stroke.
