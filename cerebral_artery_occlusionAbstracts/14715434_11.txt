Anti-inflammatory treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MLN519 has been previously reported to be neuroprotective against ischemic brain injury in rats. These effects have been related to inhibition of the transcription factor NF-kappaB, which is activated through ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of MLN519 to alter the expression of several inflammatory genes under the control of NF-kappaB. Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) followed by vehicle or MLN519 (1.0 g/kg, i.v.) treatment immediately after reperfusion of blood to the brain at 2h. Gene expression was evaluated 3-72 h post-MCAo. The most striking effects of intravenous treatment with MLN519 were associated with reductions in ICAM-1 expression at 3 h followed by reductions in E-selectin (12-72 h). Less dramatic reductions were observed in IL-1Beta (3-24 h) and TNF-Alpha (24 h) with no apparent effects on IL-6 and VCAM-1 mRNA levels. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the genes most dramatically affected by MLN519 had highest expression in endothelial cells and leukocytes (E-selectin, ICAM-1),indicating that these cell types may be the primary targets of intravenously delivered MLN519 treatment.
