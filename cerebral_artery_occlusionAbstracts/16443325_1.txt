It has been well documented that oxidative stress is involved in stroke. Currently, many neuroprotective strategies have been targeted at molecules that are able to act as an oxidant to intervene with free-radical mediated apoptosis in the ischemic penumbra. In particular, natural products which contain antioxidant properties have undoubtedly efficacious for stroke treatment. In the current study, therapeutic effects of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb) against cerebral protection in Wistar rats underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was evaluated. A comparison study was conducted by using Losartan, an antihypertensive drug. Gene expression levels of pro-apoptotic genes (AT2 receptor, Fas, Bax and Bcl-xS) have shown to have significant reduction by EGb- and Losartan-treated groups as compared to vehicle group. Significant reduction of immunoreactivity of protein production of these genes, together with least nuclear green fluorescence observed in TUNEL, EGb, as an antioxidant drug, is concluded to have potent and promising therapeutic effect for stroke treatment.
