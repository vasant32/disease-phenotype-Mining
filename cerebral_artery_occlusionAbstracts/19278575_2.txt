OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) preconditioning on blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression in subsequent ischemic hemisphere. METHODS: Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. Animals were randomly divided into four groups: normal, sham-operated, MCAO and EA groups. In EA group, rats received electroacupuncture stimuli at the Baihui acupoint (GV 20) 30 minutes/day for 5 days. Twenty-four hours after last treatment, the MCAO was performed. The brain water content and BBB permeability were measured 24 hours after MCAO. MMP-9 expression and activity were measured at 6, 12 and 24 hours after MCAO. RESULTS: The results showed that the brain water content of ischemic hemisphere was lower in EA group (81.45 +/- 1.09%) compared with MCAO group (83.98 +/- 1.30%; p<0.05). Similarly, the Evans blue content in EA group (4.90 +/- 1.77 microg/g) was lower compared with MCAO group (9.41 +/- 2.87 microg/g; p<0.05). The protein expression and enzyme activity of MMP-9 increased and reached maximum at 24 hours after reperfusion. However, the protein expression was lower in EA group at 12 and 24 hours after reperfusion (p<0.01, versus MCAO group), and enzyme activity was lower in EA group only at 24 hours (p<0.01, versus MCAO group). DISCUSSION: EA preconditioning could attenuate brain edema and BBB disruption caused by subsequent cerebral ischemia. EA preconditioning could decrease MMP-9 expression and activity, which may be an important mechanism of cerebral ischemic tolerance.
