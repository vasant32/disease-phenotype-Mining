Immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescent labeling techniques combined with confocal laser scanning microscope analysis were used to investigate the characteristic spatial induction profile of nestin following a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in adult rat brain. The results showed that nestin was induced in ischemic core at 1 day after reperfusion. In addition to ischemic core, the expression of nestin increased in peri-ischemic I, II and III regions at 3 days and 1 week, then it decreased and narrowed along the rim of ischemic core 2 weeks after reperfusion. Double immunofluorescent labeling showed that nestin positive cells were mostly co-stained with GFAP,a astrocyte marker, in peri-ischemic I region 3 days after reperfusion. At 2 weeks, however  nestin cells showed a long process and the cells double stained with nestin and NSE,a neuonal specific marker,increased in the ischemic brain. The results suggest that cerebral ischemia induces nestin expression in damaged neurons  which might favor the neuroprotection against ischemic damage.
