 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of piperphentonamine hydrochloride (PPTA) on cognitive deficits induced by ischemia-reperfusion and explore the possible mechanisms. METHODS: SD rats were randomly divided into sham-operated group, ischemia-reperfusion group (with saline injection), PPTA-treated groups (2.5, 5, 10 mg/kg) and edaravone-treated group (6 mg/kg). Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion, and the agents were administrated 1 h after ischemia. At 24 h after ischemia, step-through passive avoidance test was carried out, and 24 h later IL-1β, TNF-α, caspase-3 and HSP-70 mRNA expressions in the ischemic brain tissues were measured with RT-PCR. RESULTS: In the step-through passive avoidance test, the rats in the ischemia-reperfusion group showed significantly shorter latency and more error times than those in the sham group, and these behavioral changes were improved significantly by treatments with PPTA and edaravone. Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion caused significantly increased expressions of IL-1β, TNF-α, caspase-3 and HSP-70 mRNA, and these changes were obviously reversed by PPTA, but not by edaravone. CONCLUSIONS: PPTA can reverse cognitive deficits induced by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion probably by decreasing the inflammatory responses and cell apoptosis in the brain, suggesting its potential as a new therapeutic agent for improving the cognitive function following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.
