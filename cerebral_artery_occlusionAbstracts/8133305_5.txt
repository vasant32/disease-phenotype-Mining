Previously we reported an improvement in histological outcome in cats treated with MK-801 shortly after the induction of temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion, and examined after 2 h of ischemia followed by 4 h of reperfusion. This study investigates the prolonged effects of the same drug treatment. Focal cerebral ischemia was produced in 34 cats by temporary occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery for 2 h. Stroke severity was determined using the ratio of the EEG amplitude from the ipsilateral to that of the contralateral hemisphere. Thirty minutes after the onset of ischemia, cats were treated i.v. with either 1 mg/kg MK-801 or saline. Electrocortical activity of the animals who survived were followed for 6 days postocclusion at which point they were sacrificed for histopathological analysis. Twelve of the animals died during recovery, of which 4 were MK-801 treated, and 8 were saline controls. The EEG ratios in the non-surviving animals were more depressed than in the animals that survived, whereas the depression in the EEG amplitude in both the treated and the control surviving animals was equal. Among the survivors no reduction in infarct size with MK-801 treatment was observed. Thus treatment with MK-801 in the middle cerebral artery occlusion model in the cat leads to a significant increase in the rate of survival (P < 0.05), but no prolonged improvement in late histopathology, in contrast with acute histological findings using this model. MK-801 treatment may be shifting the stroke model towards the survival of animals with larger infarcts. Histological recovery during prolonged reperfusion may eliminate the early neuroprotective effects seen with MK-801 treatment.
