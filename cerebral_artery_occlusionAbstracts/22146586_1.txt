 Normobaric hyperoxia (NBO) has been shown to be neuro- and vaso-protective during ischemic stroke. However, the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Activation of NADPH oxidase critically contributes to ischemic brain damage via increase in ROS production. We herein tested the hypothesis that NBO protects the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via inhibiting gp91phox (or called Nox2) containing NADPH oxidase in a mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Wild-type C57/BL6 mice and gp91phoxknockout mice were given NBO (95% O2) or normoxia (21% O2) during 90-min MCAO, followed by 22.5 hrs of reperfusion. BBB damage was quantified by measuring Evans blue extravasation. The protein levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), tight junction protein occludin and gp91phox were assessed with western blot. Gel zymography was used to assess the gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9. In the wild type mice, cerebral ischemia and reperfusion led to remarkable Evans blue extravasation, significantly increased gp91phox and MMP-9 levels and decreased occludin levels in the ischemic brain tissue. In gp91phox knockout mice, the changes in Evans blue extravasation, MMP-9 and occludin were at much smaller magnitudes when compared to the wild type. Importantly, NBO treatment significantly reduced the changes in all measured parameters in wild type mice, while did not cause additional reductions in these changes when gp91phox was knocked out. These results indicate that activation of Nox2 containing NADPH oxidase is implicated in the induction of MMP-9, loss of occludin and BBB disruption in ischemic stroke, and inhibition of Nox2 may be an important mechanism underlying NBO-afforded BBB protection.
