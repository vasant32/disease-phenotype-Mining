Cerebral cortical ischemia was induced in anesthetized rats by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured with the H2 clearance technique in the center and periphery of the ischemic territory. A decrease of CBF to about 50% of pre-occlusion values was observed in both areas. Administration of Physostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, at a dose of 0.15 mg/Kg by intravenous route, induced an increase of CBF in the ischemic cortex. This change in CBF reached 120% of pre-occlusion level in the periphery and 80% of pre-occlusion value in the center of the area of distribution of the occluded artery. Although Physostigmine induced an increase in arterial blood pressure, the cerebral hyperemia observed both in normal and ischemic cortex could still be demonstrated after blockade of the pressor effect by bleeding or Phentolamine administration.
