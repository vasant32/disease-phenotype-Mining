Autoradiograms obtained after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in spontaneously hypertensive rats show that the 99mTc complex of a 2-nitroimidazole-derivatized propylene amine oxime (BMS-181321) is selectively retained in acutely ischemic brain before disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), but not in the ischemic infarct. BMS-181321 is therefore a marker of ischemic tissue at risk of infarction and its uptake, unlike that of x-ray and magnetic resonance contrast agents, does not require disruption of the BBB. In keeping with this conclusion, we have found that the single-pass cerebral extraction fraction of BMS-181321 is 0.67 at normal rat whole-brain blood flow. Sequential single-photon emission computed tomographic images obtained from cats after MCAO show that the initial distribution of BMS-181321 approximates regional CBF and that selective retention subsequently produces a positive image within the ischemic territory. BMS-181321 is the first Tc complex able to indicate not only ischemia, but also ischemic tissue at risk of infarction. Use of this novel Tc complex to monitor biochemical events during ischemia may contribute to the clinical management of acute stroke.
