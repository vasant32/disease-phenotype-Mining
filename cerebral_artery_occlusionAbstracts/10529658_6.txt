The effect of ozagrel, a selective thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)) synthetase inhibitor, on the obstruction after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion was studied in experimental animal models. The reduced spontaneously locomotor activity and the obstruction of motor coordination were improved by the administration of ozagrel in the conscious cerebral ischemia-reperfusion mouse model. Ozagrel suppressed the decrease in specific gravity of the brain tissue induced by the occlusion-reperfusion in the conscious cerebral ischemia-reperfusion SHR model, and recovered the postischemic decrease in cortical PO(2) after middle cerebral artery occlusion-reperfusion in cats. The level of TXB(2), a metabolite of TXA(2), in the brain increased after the cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, and ozagrel prevented this increase. Additionally, ozagrel also increased the level of 6-keto-PGF(1alpha), a metabolite of prostaglandin I(2) (PGI(2)), in the brain tissue after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, and the administration of PGI(2) improved the reduced spontaneous locomotor activity in the conscious cerebral ischemia-reperfusion mouse model. Our data suggest that ozagrel suppressed the obstruction following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion by preserving the cerebral blood flow via preventing the increase in TXA(2) and causing an increase in the PGI(2) level.
