One-third of patients with acute ischemic stroke develop early neurologic worsening, which is associated with increased mortality and long-term functional disability. We investigated the predictive factors for neurologic deterioration in patients with acute ischemic stroke within 1 week of onset. We retrospectively investigated 643 patients who were admitted within 2 days of acute ischemic stroke between April 2007 and March 2010. Neurologic deterioration was defined as an increase of 4 points or more in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score within 1 week of admission. We retrieved data on demographic and clinical characteristics, medications, and stroke subtypes. Out of 537 patients, deterioration was noted in 64 patients (11.9%; deterioration group). Multivariate analysis identified history of myocardial infarction (P < .001), NIHSS score ≥8 at onset (P < .001), high leukocyte count (P = .035), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥140 mg/dL (P = .002), and hemoglobin A1c ≥7% (P = .006) as significant factors associated with deterioration. Branch atheromatous disease was more frequent in the deterioration group, and >90% of patients with deterioration either were discharged to nursing home care or died. Multivariate analysis of magnetic resonance imaging findings identified internal carotid/middle cerebral artery occlusion (each P < .001), striate capsular infarction (P = .030), pontine infarction (P = .047), and lesion size of 15-30 mm (P = .011) as independent factors associated with deterioration. Stroke patients with a high low-density lipoprotein level, high hemoglobin A1c level on admission, a history of myocardial infarction, and high NIHSS score are at high risk for neurologic deterioration. Patients with multiple risk factors for deterioration can benefit most from intensive monitoring.
