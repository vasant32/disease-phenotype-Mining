Fetal rat cortical cells have been shown previously to survive at the periphery of cerebral infarction. The present study was designed to examine the ability of fetal cells to survive at the edge of the central core of ischemia. In three groups of 8 adult Sprague-Dawley rats, fetal cortical cells from ED 16 were stereotactically transplanted at 3 h, 24 h, and 7 days after unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion. In 6 rats, fetal cells were transplanted by using the same coordinates, without arterial occlusion, for control. In the ischemic groups, overall graft survival was 85%, and in the control group, all grafts survived. Graft survival was determined by light microscopy. No significant difference was found in the survival of grafts transplanted at different intervals after middle cerebral artery occlusion. It is concluded that fetal cortical cells can survive in cerebral tissue undergoing severe ischemic change.
