Free radical-mediated neuronal cell damage is an important pathological process in ischemic stroke. We have previously reported a novel dual-functional agent, 2-[[(1,1-dimethylethyl)oxidoimino]-methyl]-3,5,6-trimethylpyrazine (TBN), a derivative of tetramethylpyrazine armed with anitrone moiety. In this report, we further evaluate TBN'stherapeutic parameters in a rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. Its abilities to cross the blood-brain barrier, scavenge free radicals, and inhibit Ca(2+) influx were also investigated. TBN showed significant activity in both the transient MCAO (t-MCAO) and permanent MCAO (p-MCAO) stroke models in the rat. The therapeutic time window is 8 hr in the t-MCAO model. TBN readily crossed the blood-brain barrier and in vitro had strong activity in neutralizing 路OH, O(-)(2)路, and ONOO(-) and significantly decreased intracellular Ca(2+) concentration. TBN is a promising new treatment forischemic stroke, with multiple mechanisms of action. It blocks Ca(2+) overload and neutralizes 路OH, O(-)(2)路, and ONOO(-).
