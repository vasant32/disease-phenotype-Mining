OBJECTIVE: To study whether regional brain calcium change would be an important factor for ischemic neuranal damage and whether calcium antagonist would exert protective effects on cerebral ischemia. METHODS: OCPC autoanalyzer method, was used to measure the regional brain calcium and observe the influence of flunarizine (FNZ) 48 hours after the rabbit middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). RESULTS: 48 hours after MCAO, the calcium in the ischemic middle cerebral artery territory was 10.8 times as much as that in the pseudo-occluded controls, and FNZ could significantly decrease the ischemic brain calcium (P < 0.05) and the ischemic cerebral edema (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Caoverload was animportant factor leading to ischemic neuronal death, and FNZ has protective effects on cerebral ischemia.
