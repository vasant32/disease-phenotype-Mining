We report a case of an acute middle cerebral artery (M2 segment) occlusion that was refractory to intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV t-PA), thrombectomy with the Merci device, intra-arterial infusion of urokinase and eptifibatide, and balloon angioplasty. The artery was so tortuous that over-the-wire stent placement failed and a salvage technique was required to place the self-expanding stent.
