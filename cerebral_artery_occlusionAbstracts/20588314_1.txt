By optimizing thresholds, we identified the perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (PWI) parameters that accurately predict final infarct volume and neurologic outcome in a primate model of permanent middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. Ten cynomolgus monkeys underwent PWI and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) at 3 and 47 hours, respectively, after right MCA occlusion using platinum coils, and were killed at 48 hours. Volumes of the hypoperfused areas on PWI were automatically measured using different thresholds and 11 parametric maps to determine the optimum threshold (at which least difference was found between the average volumes on PWI and those determined using specimens or DWI). In the case of arrival time (AT), cerebral blood volume (CBV), time to peak (TTP), time to maximum (T(max)), and cerebral blood flow (CBF) determined using deconvolution techniques, the volume of the hypoperfused area significantly correlated with the infarct volumes and the neurologic deficit scores with small variations, whereas in the case of mean transit time and nondeconvolution CBF, relatively poor correlations with large variations were seen. At optimum threshold, AT, CBV, TTP, T(max), and deconvolution CBF can accurately predict the final infarct volume and neurologic outcome in monkeys with permanent MCA occlusion.
