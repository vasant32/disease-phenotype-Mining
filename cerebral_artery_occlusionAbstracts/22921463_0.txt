Middle cerebral artery occlusion(1) (MCAO) is a widely used experimental technique in rodents to model both the short-term pathological events and longer term neuroanatomical and functional damage associated with focal ischemia. Various neurobehavioral tasks have been developed to assess the motor and cognitive dysfunctions associated with MCAO in rodents, and these studies have revealed deficits related to long-term sensorimotor function, as well as retention of spatial memory. Assessment of auditory processing in a MCAO model has not been undertaken, despite findings suggesting an auditory processing deficit in humans with stroke induced-aphasia, a common post-stroke deficit. Using a modified pre-pulse inhibition paradigm, and other behavioral tasks thought to tap "language-related processing", adult male C57Bl/6 mice were subjected to 60 minute MCAO or Sham surgery and were behaviorally assessed from P58 to P124 (2 to 65 days post-surgery). Tasks were selected based on evidence that rapid auditory processing(2) (RAP) skills are associated with language processing indices in clinical populations. Cognitive and sensorimotor ability was evaluated using the Morris water maze, non-spatial water maze, and a post-injury rotarod task administered over multiple days (motor learning). Combined behavioral results from post-MCAO mice provide evidence of a RAP deficit as well as deficits in spatial, non-spatial, and motor learning. Overall results support a fuller characterization of behavioral deficits in auditory processing after MCAO.
