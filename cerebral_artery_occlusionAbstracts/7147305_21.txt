This investigation describes a surgical approach for ligation of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in the young rat and evaluates consequences of the occlusion with a neurologic exam for motor deficits, Evans blue test for blood-brain barrier leaks, and light microscopy for histologic changes after 3 days. Evans blue extravasation and the lesion were limited to cortex at the burr hole site in occluded and sham operated rats. MCA occlusion beyond the point of origin of the striate branches in the young rat results in neither neurological deficits, dye markings, nor histologic changes in the distal vascular field to indicate an infarct. Apparently, the young rodent collateral supply maintains the tissue in a viable state.
