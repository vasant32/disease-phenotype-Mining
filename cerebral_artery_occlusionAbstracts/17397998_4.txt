Tanshinone IIB (TSB) is a major active constituent of the root of Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen) used in the treatment of acute stroke. Danshen extracts and TSB have shown marked neuron-protective effects in mouse studies but there is a lack of clinical evidence for the neuron-protective effects of Danshen and its active ingredients. This study investigated the neuron-protective effects of TSB in experimentally stroked rats. TSB at 5 and 25 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection significantly reduced the focal infarct volume, cerebral histological damage and apoptosis in rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) compared to MCAO rats receiving vehicle. This study demonstrated that TSB was effective in reducing stroke-induced brain damage and may represent a novel drug candidate for further development. Further mechanistic studies are needed for the neuron-protective activity of TSB.
