To date, the long-term effects of reperfusion on the salvaged brain tissues have not been addressed in the literature. We report 4 cases presenting subacute neurological deteriorations with selective axonal injury following reperfusion therapies for acute ischemic stroke. Our case series based on 4 patients showed common features distinct from those of early reperfusion injury in that (1) the neurological symptoms developed after 1-2 months of reperfusion therapies, (2) these symptoms were accompanied by the subcortical white matter changes on brain MRI, and (3) these findings were mostly reversible with time. This suggests that axons in the reperfused brain may be vulnerable to further neurological injury.
