OBJECT: Insulin has been shown to ameliorate cerebral necrosis in global and, more recently, in focal cerebral ischemia. The goal of this study was to determine the relationship between this neuroprotective effect and blood sugar levels in a rat model of focal ischemia. METHODS: Thirty-four rats were subjected to 80 minutes of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion at a mean arterial blood pressure of 60 mm Hg and a temperature of 37 degrees C. Insulin (3.5 IU/kg) was administered 1 hour before (12 rats) and 20 minutes after (12 rats) ischemia; 10 animals served as controls. A quantitative histopathological study conducted after 1 week of survival showed that insulin was not beneficial in reducing the size of the infarction or selective neuronal necrosis in the penumbra when administered before or after ischemia. In addition to infarction, six animals from the insulin-treated groups had bilateral selective neuronal necrosis in the hippocampus or the neocortex. A nonlinear regression analysis in which glucose levels were compared with both cortical necrosis and total infarction yielded a U-shaped curve with a nadir for cerebral necrosis that lay in the 6- to 7-mM blood glucose range. The increased brain damage induced by insulin occurred in animals with very low blood sugar values in the range of 2 to 3 mM. CONCLUSIONS: These results in rats indicate that if insulin is used following ischemia, blood glucose levels should be maintained at approximately 6 to 7 mM. From these data one can infer that hypoglycemia of less than 3 mM should be avoided in situations of focal cerebral ischemia in which insulin is used. Additional animal studies and clinical trials in humans are needed to study the effects of insulin on ischemia.
