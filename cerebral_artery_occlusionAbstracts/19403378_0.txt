OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) on angiogenesis after focal cerebral ischemia. METHODS: Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 120 min in adult SD rats with intracerebroventricular VIP administration at the beginning of reperfusion. Immunohistochemistry was performed to assay BrdU immunoreactive endothelial cells, expressions of VEGF, flt-1 and flk-1 in the ischemic zone, and the protein expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the brain was measured using Western blotting. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical staining revealed significantly increased BrdU immunoreactive endothelial cells on the margins of the ischemic lesion in rats treated with VIP as compared with that in the control rats (P<0.05). VIP significantly increased the number of VEGF immunoreactive cells and flt-1- and flk-1-positive endothelial cells in comparison with the control group (P<0.01). Western blotting showed that VIP treatment resulted in significantly increased VEGF protein level in the ipsilateral hemisphere (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: VIP enhances angiogenesis in the ischemic brain by increasing the expressions of VEGF in the brain tissue and its receptors flt-1 and flk-1 in the endothelial cells.
