Eplerenone, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, is reported to be effective to prevent end-stage cardiovascular damage induced by aldosterone. However, the effect of eplerenone on brain damage is not fully understood. Here, we investigated whether pretreatment with eplerenone attenuates stroke size in mice subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion. Middle cerebral artery occlusion with a microfilament technique induced focal ischemia, to approximately 25% of the total area in a coronal section of the brain. Treatment with eplerenone at a dose of 1.67 mg/g chow significantly reduced the ischemic area, ischemic volume, and neurological deficit, without a blood pressure-lowering effect. Laser-Doppler flowmetry analysis showed a decrease in surface cerebral blood flow in the peripheral region after 1 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion. This decrease was smaller in mice treated with eplerenone. Superoxide production evaluated by staining with dihydroethidium was attenuated in the ischemic area of the brain in eplerenone-treated mice. Taken together, our findings suggest that eplerenone has a protective effect on ischemic brain damage, at least partly due to improvement of cerebral blood flow in the penumbra and reduction of oxidative stress.
