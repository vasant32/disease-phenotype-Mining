Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide is a pleiotropic neuropeptide. We previously showed that heterozygous PACAP gene knockout (PACAP(+/-)) mice had larger infarct volumes and worse neurological scores after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). However, the relationship between endogenous PACAP levels and edema in the ischemic brain has not yet been evaluated. In this study, the formation of edema in the ischemic brain as well as cerebral blood flow was compared between PACAP(+/-) and wild-type (PACAP(+/+)) mice. The amount of brain edema was calculated by subtracting the contralateral volume from the ipsilateral volume 24 h after permanent MCAO. PACAP(+/-) mice showed significantly greater brain edema than PACAP(+/+) mice. To investigate the effects of endogenous PACAP on blood flow during ischemia, cerebral blood flow in the ipsilateral and the contralateral cortices was compared between PACAP(+/-) and PACAP(+/+) mice for 25 min after ischemia. With a two-dimensional laser Doppler perfusion imaging system, the blood flow in the ipsilateral and contralateral cortices was shown to be similar in PACAP(+/-) and PACAP(+/+) mice during ischemia. These results suggest that endogenous PACAP suppresses the formation of edema in the ischemic brain.
