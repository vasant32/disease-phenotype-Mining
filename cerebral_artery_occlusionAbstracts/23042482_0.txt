The present study aimed to evaluate the expression of neuro-oncological ventral antigen 1 (Nova1) in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) insults by immunohistochemistry. The focal cerebral I/R model was induced by right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 120 min followed by 1 day, 7 days, and 14 days of reperfusion in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The results showed that Nova1 was expressed in nearly the whole brain, although with higher density in hippocampus, hypothalamus, cingulate cortex, and medial habenular nucleus. The immunoreactivity of Nova1 neurons was increased dramatically, especially on both sides of the hippocampal CA(1) region, after 1 day of reperfusion. A strong response occurred at the ipsilateral CA(1) region between 1 day and 7 days of reperfusion. Likewise, strong compensatory responses of Nova1 expression were observed on the contralateral side of the striate cortex, dentate gyrus, and hypothalamus. Interestingly, more Nova1 neurons were observed to translocate to the dendrites and growth cones of the axons in the hypothalamus on the ischemic side after 7 days of reperfusion. In conclusion, our data suggest that Nova1 might mediate neuronal responsiveness, and its expression might positively correlate with neural repair after I/R insults in the rat brain.
