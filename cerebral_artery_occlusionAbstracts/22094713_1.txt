It is increasingly clear that microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in controlling cell survival. However, the functional significance of miRNAs in ischemic brain injury remains poorly understood. In the present study, we assayed the expression levels of miR-29b after ischemic brain injury, and defined the target genes and biological functions of miR-29b. We found that the miR-29b levels were significantly increased in rat brain after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and neurons after oxygen-glucose deprivation. Moreover, ectopic expression of miR-29b promoted neuronal cell death, whereas its repression decreased cell death. Furthermore, we verified that miR-29b directly targeted and inhibited Bcl2L2 gene expression, and then increased neuronal cell death. Importantly, Bcl2L2 overexpression rescued neuronal cell death induced by miR-29b. These results suggest an important role of miR-29b in regulating neuronal cell death, thus offering a new target for the development of therapeutic agents against ischemic brain injury.
