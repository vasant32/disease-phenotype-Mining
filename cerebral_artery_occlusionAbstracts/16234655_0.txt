OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: In strictly selected cases of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion, revascularization by extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass can be considered. The interventional recanalization of the occlusion under direct surgical control has not been reported in the literature so far. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 39-year-old Caucasian female patient had experienced an ischemic stroke 15 years before she came to our attention. At that time, occlusion of the right MCA was diagnosed by angiography. Her neurological deficit resolved within 6 months. Fifteen years later, the patient experienced repeated numbness of her left-sided extremities, which was refractory to medical treatment. Angiography revealed an occluded M1 segment of the MCA. Perfusion computed tomography without and after CO2 stimulation disclosed impaired cerebrovascular capacity. INTERVENTION: The patient was scheduled for EC-IC bypass. The MCA tree was exposed, and the occluded portion was found to be 10 mm long. We then decided to reopen the vessel by balloon dilation under direct visual control. A catheter was advanced to the M1 origin, where a glidewire was passed into the vessel lumen. With only a little help from the surgeon, it was surprisingly easy to direct the glidewire through the occluded segment. At this time, flow through the M1 segment was re-established. Flow through the MCA that had occluded for 15 years was re-established. CONCLUSION: On the basis of our experience, in nonatherosclerotic occlusions, intravascular intervention may be considered.
