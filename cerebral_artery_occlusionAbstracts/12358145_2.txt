In this study, we investigated whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is involved in the progression of cerebral infarct lesions after middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in rats. After placebo or trandolapril was administered orally for 7 days, we infarcted in the territory of the right MCA by extracranial vascular occlusion and studied the effect of trandolapril on brain ACE activity and infarct size 7 days after MCA occlusion. In placebo-treated rats, brain ACE activity in the infarct side was increased by a significant 1.34-fold compared with that in the non-infarct side 7 days after MCA occlusion. Brain ACE activities in the infarct sides were suppressed to 39.8% by trandolapril treatment. The ratios of unilateral infarcts to the total coronal sectional areas in placebo- and trandolapril-treated rats were 48.1 +/- 3.3% and 37.4 +/- 2.3%, respectively, and the difference between these values was significant. These results demonstrate that inhibition of the increased brain ACE activity in infarct lesions can reduce the infarction area after MCA occlusion.
