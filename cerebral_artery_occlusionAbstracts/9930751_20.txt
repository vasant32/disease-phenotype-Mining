The possible effects of the polyamine interconversion pathway on tissue polyamine levels, brain edema formation, and ischemic injury volume were studied by using a selective irreversible inhibitor, MDL 72527, of the interconversion pathway enzyme, polyamine oxidase. In an intraluminal suture occlusion model of middle cerebral artery in spontaneously hypertensive rats, 100 mg/kg MDL 72527 changed the brain edema formation from 85.7 +/- 0.3 to 84.5 +/- 0.9% in cortex (p < 0.05) and from 79.9 +/- 1.7 to 78.4 +/- 2.0% in subcortex (difference not significant). Ischemic injury volume was reduced by 22% in the cortex (p < 0.05) and 17% in the subcortex (p < 0.05) after inhibition of polyamine oxidase by MDL 72527. There was an increase in tissue putrescine levels together with a decrease in spermine and spermidine levels at the ischemic site compared with the nonischemic site after ischemia-reperfusion injury. The increase in putrescine levels at the ischemic cortical and subcortical region was reduced by a mean of 45% with MDL 72527 treatment. These results suggest that the polyamine interconversion pathway has an important role in the postischemic increase in putrescine levels and that blocking of this pathway can be neuroprotective against neuronal cell damage after temporary focal cerebral ischemia.
