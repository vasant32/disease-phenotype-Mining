OBJECTIVE: To discuss the protective effects of pueraria compound on the cerebral ischemic injury. METHOD: Using the middle cerebral artery occlusion model (MCAO) in rats and cerebral ischemia-reperfusion models in gerbils and mice, we investigated the influence of pueraria compound on the brain water content and the infarct size, the cerebral apoplexy exponent, the contents of lactic acid (LA) and lipid peroxide (LPO), the activities of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and Na+ -K+ -ATPase. RESULT: Pueraria compound obviously reduced the brain water content and the infrarct size in MCAO, improved motor abilities in the cerebral ischemia-reinfusion model of gerbils, decreased the contents of LA and LPO and increased the activities of LDH, GPx and Na+ -K+ -ATPase in cerebral ischemia-reinfusion model of mice. CONCLUSION: Pueraria compound has the function of antioxidation and protective effect on ischemic brain tissue.
