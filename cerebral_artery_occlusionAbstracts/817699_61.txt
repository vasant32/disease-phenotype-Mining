Regional cerebral ischemia was produced in 18 Java monkeys by permanent middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. All monkeys were thereafter paralyzed (pancuronium bromide, 0.05 mg/kg/hr) and sedated (diazepam, 0.1 mg/kg/hr) for a 48-hour period. Thirty minutes after MCA occlusion, pentobarbital sodium anesthesia was induced in nine of the monkeys (14 mg/kg) and maintained for 48 hours (7 mg/kg every two hours), with continuous supportive care. After 48 hours, all drugs were discontinued; the monkeys were observed for five days, and then killed. Seven of the control monkeys developed a cerebral infarction, three did not survive past the 48 hours of intensive care, and the other four had a notable neurologic deficit. All pentobarbital monkeys survived the seven days, but four had a cerebral infarction and two of these had a notable neurologic deficit. These differences were statistically significant.
