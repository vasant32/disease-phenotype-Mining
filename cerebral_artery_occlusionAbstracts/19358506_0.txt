OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanism of acupoint sticking of "Hua yutie" in improving ischemic stroke. METHODS: Eighty rats were randomly divided into 5 groups, a model group, an acupoint sticking group, an acupuncture group, a Nimodipine group and a normal group. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was used for preparation of focal cerebral ischemic rat model. After modeling, any treatment was not given to the model group; for the acupoint sticking group, "Hua yutie" was applied at "Dazhui" (GV 14) ,"Qihai" (CV 6) and "Mingmen" (GV 4); for the acupuncture group, acupuncture was given at the same acupoints as those in the acupoint sticking group; the Nimodipine group received intragastric administration of Nimodipine. And the normal group did not receive any treatment. Their infarction volume, the cerebral water content, expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the protein level were observed. RESULTS: The infarction volume coincided with the dominative scope of the middle cerebral artery of the electric coagulation. There were significant differences in the cerebral water content as the various treatment groups compared with that of the model group (all P<0.05). The VEGF positive cell number and the protein level around the infarction area in the acupoint sticking group were increased as compared with those in the model group (P<0.01), with no significant difference as compared with the Nimodipine group and the acupuncture group (all P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Acupoint sticking of "Hua yutie" alleviates the cerebral damage after ischemia possibly through enhancing the expression and protein level of VEGF.
