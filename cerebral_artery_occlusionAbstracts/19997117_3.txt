Heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) has a major role in mediating survival responses to a range of central nervous system insults, functioning as a protein chaperone, an antioxidant, and through inhibition of cell death pathways. We have used transgenic mice overexpressing HSP27 (HSP27tg) to examine the role of HSP27 in cerebral ischemia, using model of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Infarct size was evaluated using multislice T(2)-weighted anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after 24 h. A significant reduction of 30% in infarct size was detected in HSP27tg animals compared with wild-type (WT) littermates. To gain some insight into the mechanisms contributing to cell death and its attenuation by HSP27, we monitored the effect of induction of c-jun and ATF3 on tissue survival in MCAO and their effects on the expression of endogenous mouse HSP25 and HSP70. It is important that, the c-jun induction seen at 4 h tended to be localized to regions that were salvageable in HSP27tg mice but became infarcted in WT animals. Our results provide support for the powerful neuroprotective effects of HSP27 in cerebral ischemia.
