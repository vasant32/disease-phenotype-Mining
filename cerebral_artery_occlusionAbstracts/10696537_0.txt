1. A common 'stroke model', the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion preparation, was used to compare photocoagulation with mechanical occlusion. 2. Areas of cerebral infarction and of vascular leakage were compared using these two methods. The general pattern of damage was similar, with central infarcted areas surrounded by larger vascular leakage areas. 3. The two models differed in the extent of their vascular leakage areas and in their response to the cerebroprotective agent flunarizine. 4. We conclude that the two models are not equivalent, probably because they do not damage the vascular endothelium to the same degree.
