OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of Tongxinluo on adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), anti-oxidant enzymes activities, and lipid peroxidation of mitochondria or brain homogenate in focal brain ischemia-reperfusion rats. METHODS: The models of the focal brain ischemia-reperfusion rats were made by the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and ATPase and malonaldehyde (MDA) levels of mitochondria or brain homogenate were measured by biochemical methods. RESULTS: Tongxinluo significantly inhibited the decrease of activities of SOD and the increase of MDA levels, but had no difference in GSH-Px in brain homogenate. It also inhibited the decrease of activities of SOD, GSH-Px, ATPase, and the increase of MDA levels in mitochondria. CONCLUSION: The protective mechanisms of Tongxinluo against mitochondrial injuries in focal ischemia-reperfusion rats may be derived from reducing lipid peroxides, scavenging free radicals and improving the energy metabolism.
