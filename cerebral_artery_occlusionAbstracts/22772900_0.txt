The synthetic peptide Semax (Met-Glu-His-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro) is used successfully in acute stroke therapy. In spite of numerous studies on the subject, many aspects of the neuroprotective effects of the peptide remain unknown. We studied the action of Semax and its C-terminal tripeptide Pro-Gly-Pro on the expression of the VEGF gene family (Vegf-a, Vegf-b, Vegf-c, Vegf-d, and Plgf) and their receptors (Vegfr-1, Vegfr-2, and Vegfr-3) in the frontoparietal cortex region of the rat brain at 3, 24, and 72 h after permanent left middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). The relative mRNA level of the genes studied was assessed using real-time reverse transcription-PCR. The Vegf-b and Vegf-d genes were most affected by the peptides, which resulted in their most noticeable activation at 3 h after pMCAO. The level of Vegf-d transcripts decreased considerably, whereas the mRNA level of the Vegf-b gene was significantly increased after 72 h of treatment with each of the peptides. In addition, the effects of the peptides on the expression of the Vegf-b and Vegf-d genes were the opposite of the action of ischemia. It is suggested that the identified effects of the peptides diminish the effects of ischemia, thus participating in the positive therapeutic effect of Semax on ischemic stroke.
