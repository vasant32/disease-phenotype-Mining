Several proteins are known to be markedly expressed in the brain during cerebral ischemia, however the change in protein profiles within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after an ischemic insult has not been fully elucidated. We studied the changes in the CSF proteome in rat transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model. Surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) was used to detect the time-course changes in CSF protein patterns after transient focal brain ischemia. According to hierarchical cluster analysis by self-organising tree algorism (SOTA), the temporal pattern of protein peaks was divided into four groups: acute increase group, chronic increase group, gradual decrease group and unchanged group. In the acute increase group, the expression of a 13.6-kDa protein was markedly increased during the acute phase. The 13.6-kDa protein was identified as monomeric form of transthyretin using two-dimensional electrophoresis and peptide mass fingerprinting based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. The monomeric transthyretin may represent an ischemia-specific CSF marker to indicate the sequential changes according to ischemic insults of the brain.
