AIM: To study the effect of dl-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in forcal cerebral ischemia rats. METHODS: In chloral hydrate-anesthetized rat, the proximal portion of right middle cerebral artery (RMCA) was occluded, and H2 needle electrode was implanted in right striatum. rCBF was monitored in striatum using hydrogen clearance method. RESULTS: Ten min after RMCA occlusion (RMCAO), NBP (5, 10, 20 mg.kg-1 i.p.) markedly increased rCBF to striatum (P < 0.01). When NBP was given i.p. 40 min after RMCAO, the increasing effect on rCBF was also observed (P < 0.05). However, when NBP was injected i.p. 60 min after RMCAO, the increasing effect of NBP on rCBF was not found. In NBP-pretreated (i.p. 40 min before RMCAO) group, rCBF in striatum measured at different time points of 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min after RMCAO were increased by 97%, 107%, 136%, 211%, 173%, and 317%, respectively, compared with the percentages of vehicle group. The potency of the effect of Nim (0.5 mg.kg-1 i.p.) was similar to that of NBP (10 mg.kg-1 i.p.). CONCLUSION: NBP pre-treatment or post-treatment markedly enhanced the rCBF to striatum in RMCAO rats.
