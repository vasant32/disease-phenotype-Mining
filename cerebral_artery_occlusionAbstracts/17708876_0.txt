OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of folic acid, vitamin B(6) and B(12) on plasma homocysteine and on learning and memory functions in focal cerebral ischemia rats. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups. They were sham operation group (Sham OP), middle cerebral artery occlusion model group (MCAO), MCAO + folic acid group (MCAO + FA) and MCAO + compound vitamin (folate, vitamin B(6) and B(12)) group (MCAO + CV). Plasma homocysteine was measured before and after supplementation and after ischemia. RESULTS: The level of plasma homocysteine in MCAO + FA and MCAO + CV groups were significantly lower than those in Sham OP and MCAO groups after supplementation and ischemia (6.92 +/- 1.04) micromol/L and (5.49 +/- 1.00) micromol/L vs (9.33 +/- 1.11) micromol/L, (10.90 +/- 2.03 micromol/L), P < 0.05. While in MCAO + CV group was lower than that in MCAO + FA group (5.49 +/- 1.00) micromol/L vs (6.92 +/- 1.04) micromol/L, P < 0.05. The neurological deficit scores and shock times in Y-type maze of MCAO + FA and MCAO + CV groups were lower than those in MCAO group (1.75 +/- 0.46 and 1.38 +/- 0.52 vs 2.62 +/- 0.52; 123.50 +/- 39.77 and 86.25 +/- 21.39 vs 173.25 +/- 46.32, P < 0.05). The correct times of MCAO + CV group in Y-type maze was higher than that in MCAO group (3.75 +/- 0.42 vs 2.12 +/- 0.45, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Folic acid intake could not only reduce plasma homocysteine concentration but also promote the recovery of the learning and memory functions of rats with cerebral ischemia. The effects of folic acid combined with vitamin B(6) and vitamin B(12) on cerebral ischemia rats was better than that of single folate.
