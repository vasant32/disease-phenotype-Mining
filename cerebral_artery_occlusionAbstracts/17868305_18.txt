The protective effect of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) in stroke models is poorly understood. We studied patterns of PACAP, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and the PACAP-selective receptor PAC1 after middle cerebral artery occlusion and neuroprotection by PACAP in cortical cultures exposed to oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD). Within hours, focal ischemia caused a massive, NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent up-regulation of PACAP in cortical pyramidal cells. PACAP expression dropped below the control level after 2 days and was normalized after 4 days. Vasoactive intestinal peptide expression was regulated oppositely to that of PACAP. PAC1 mRNA showed ubiquitous expression in neurons and astrocytes with minor changes after ischemia. In cultured cortical neurons PACAP27 strongly activated Erk1/2 at low and p38 MAP kinase at higher nanomolar concentrations via PAC1. In astrocyte cultures, effects of PACAP27 on Erk1/2 and p38 were weak. During OGD, neurons showed severely reduced Erk1/2 activity and dephosphorylation of Erk1/2-regulated Ser112 of pro-apoptotic Bad. PACAP27 stimulation counteracted Erk1/2 inactivation and Bad dephosphorylation during short-term OGD but was ineffective after expanded OGD. Consistently, PACAP27 caused MEK-dependent neuroprotection during mild but not severe hypoxic/ischemic stress. While PACAP27 protected neurons at 1-5 nmol/L, full PAC1 activation by 100 nmol/L PACAP exaggerated hypoxic/ischemic damage. PACAP27 stimulation of astrocytes increased the production of Akt-activating factors and conferred ischemic tolerance to neurons. Thus, ischemia-induced PACAP may act via neuronal and astroglial PAC1. PACAP confers protection to ischemic neurons by maintaining Erk1/2 signaling via neuronal PAC1 and by increasing neuroprotective factor production via astroglial PAC1.
