OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanism of rehabilitation after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). METHODS: MCAO model was reproduced with two-kidney, two clip renovascular hypertensive rats stroke-prone (RHRSP), which were divided into two groups, the treated group (treated with electric stimulus) and the control group (untreated model) randomly. The rehabilitation of rats was evaluated by balance beam walking test. The ultrastructural changes of neurons and astrocytes, expressions of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells, neurofilament (NF) protein, and cerebral capillary dilatation M-associated protein-2 (MAP2), as well as the neurons apoptosis and the number of dilatation of cerebral capillary in the margin of infarcted area were observed by the end of 1st, 3rd, 6th and 9th week after modeling. RESULTS: The motor function of paralysed limbs recovered better in the treated group than that in the control group by the end of 3-9th week after MCAO, the expression of GFAP-positive cells in astrocytes and NF, MAP2 in neurons as well as the number of cerebral capillary dilatation at the margin of infarcted area were higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Electric stimulation treatment could improve the recovery of motor function of paralyzed limbs. It might be due to the effect of electric stimulus in increasing astrocytes proliferation, reinforcing activity of neurons and evoking the dilatation of cerebral capillary.
