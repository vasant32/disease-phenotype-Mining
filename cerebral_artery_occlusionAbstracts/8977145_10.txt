We aimed to investigate effect of temperature on the jugular levels of nitric oxide (NO) at reperfusion after focal cerebral ischemia. Both nitrosyl hemoglobin (HbNO) (2.5 +/- 0.4 microM) and plasma nitrite plus nitrate levels (61 +/- 5 microM) in rats under normothermia (approximately 37 degrees C) after 30 min of reperfusion following 2 h of left middle cerebral artery occlusion were significantly high, compared with sham operated rats (1.3 +/- 0.1 microM, 40 +/- 4 microM, respectively). Both HbNO (1.5 +/- 0.3 microM) and nitrite plus nitrate levels (43 +/- 7 microM) under moderate hypothermia (approximately 32 degrees C) were significantly low, compared with normothermic rats. HbNO (2.8 +/- 0.8 microM) and nitrite plus nitrate levels (65 +/- 8 microM) under mild hyperthermia (approximately 39 degrees C) were not significantly high. These results firstly demonstrated that hypothermia suppresses the elevation in intrajugular NO after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.
