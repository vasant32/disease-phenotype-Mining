Ischemic postconditioning has been described in both heart and brain. The first aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Sevoflurane postconditioning (SP) on brain biochemical parameters, Bcl-2, Bax, c-Fos and Caspase-3 protein levels and Bcl-2, Bax, TNF-α and Caspase-3 mRNA expression in the middle cerebral artery occlusion model. Results showed that SP markedly decreased cerebral oxidative injury and improved immunity activity. In addition, SP significantly enhanced cerebral Bcl-2, c-Fos and decreased Bax, Caspase-3 proteins positive expression. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that SP markedly enhanced Bcl-2, and decreased Bax, TNF-α and Caspase-3 mRNA expression. Our results confirm that SP can play the protective action against cerebral ischemia reperfusion-induced brain injury by regulating cerebral antioxidant enzymes activities, Bcl-2, Bax, c-Fos and Caspase-3 protein positive expression levels and Bcl-2, Bax, TNF-α and Caspase-3 mRNA expression.
