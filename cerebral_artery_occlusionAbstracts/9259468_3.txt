Differential pulse voltammetry with treated carbon fibre micro-electrodes has been successfully employed in in vivo analysis of neurotransmitter release and metabolism. This methodology has been now applied to ex vivo preparations (brain slices) in order to study diverse neurotransmitter activities in various brain regions ipsilateral and controlateral to a middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion performed in anaesthetised adult male rats. Data demonstrated that significant changes of voltammetric ascorbic acid levels related to the ischaemic state were monitored within the ipsilateral to MCA occlusion frontal cortex, striatum, nucleus accumbens and hippocampus which were the brain area studied. Furthermore, it appeared that voltammetric catecholaminergic and 5-hydroxy indolaminergic values measured within the nucleus accumbens controlateral to MCA occlusion differ significantly from the results monitored with the same technique in brain slices obtained from sham rats. In various studies, the brain regions contralateral to MCA occlusion are generally considered as control areas, however, the present data suggest that the nucleus accumbens contralateral to the MCA occlusion side is specifically affected by the ischaemic state.
