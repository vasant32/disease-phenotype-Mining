Human umbilical cord blood (hUCB) is a rich source of hematopoietic stem cells that have been used to reconstitute immune cells and blood lineages. Cells from another hematopoietic source, bone marrow, have been found to differentiate into neural cells and are effective in the treatment of stroke. In this study, we administered hUCB cells intravenously into the femoral vein or directly into the striatum and assessed which route of cell administration produced the greatest behavioral recovery in rats with permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). All animals were immunosuppressed with cyclosporine (CSA). When spontaneous activity was measured using the Digiscan automated system, it was found to be significantly less when hUCB was transplanted 24 hr after stroke compared with nontransplanted, stroked animals (P < 0.01). Furthermore, behavioral recovery was similar with both striatal and femoral hUCB delivery. This is in contrast to the step test, in which significant improvements were found only after femoral delivery of the hUCB cells. In the passive avoidance test, transplanted animals learned the task faster than nontransplanted animals (P < 0.05). Together, these results suggest that hUCB transplantation may be an effective treatment for brain injuries, such as stroke, or neurodegenerative disorders. In addition, intravenous delivery may be more effective than striatal delivery in producing long-term functional benefits to the stroked animal.
