We hypothesized that static skeletal muscle contraction-induced systemic cardiovascular responses, and central glutamate/GABA release in rostral (RVLM) and caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM), would be modulated by cerebral ischemia. In sham-operated rats, a 2-min tibial nerve stimulation induced static contraction of the triceps surae, evoked pressor responses, increased glutamate in both the RVLM and CVLM, decreased GABA in the CVLM, and increased GABA in the RVLM. In rats with a temporary 90-min left middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by 24 h reperfusion, pressor responses during muscle contractions were attenuated, as were glutamate within the left RVLM and left CVLM. Glutamate within the right RVLM and right CVLM were unaltered and similar to those in sham rats. In contrast, GABA increases during muscle contractions were enhanced in the left RVLM and CVLM but changes within the right CVLM and RVLM were similar to those in sham rats. These results indicate that unilateral ischemia increases ipsilateral GABA/glutamate ratios during muscle contraction in the RVLM. In contrast, opposite changes in ipsilateral glutamate and GABA release within the RVLM and CVLM were observed following a 90-min right-sided MCAO followed by 24 h reperfusion. However, cardiovascular responses during muscle contraction were depressed following such an ischemic brain injury. These data suggest that transient ischemic brain injury attenuates cardiovascular responses to static exercise via modulating neurotransmission within the ventrolateral medulla.
