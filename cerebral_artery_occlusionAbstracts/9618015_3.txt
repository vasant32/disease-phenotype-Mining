The working memory version of the Morris water escape task, the repeated acquisition task, consists of trial pairs in which an animal is started twice from the same start position. Animals have mastered this task when they need less time to find the platform in the second of the two trials. In this study, study, male C57BL mice were trained on this task with massed, spaced, or spaced delay trials in which there was a 90-min delay between the first and second trials of a pair. The mice trained with spaced trials learned the repeated acquisition task, whereas the mice trained with massed or spaced delay trials were not consistently able to do so. When the mice had reached a stable baseline performance, the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was occluded or the mice were sham-operated. Then, the effects of the MCA occlusion (MCA-O) on the performance in the repeated acquisition tasks were studied. MCA occlusion hardly affected the performance in this task, irrespective of the spacing condition of the trials, although surgery per se seemed to have a transient disruptive effect.
