We studied three patients fitting the clinical syndrome of "pure sensory" stroke. The abnormalities on computerized tomography (CT) scan differed and included posterior cerebral artery occlusion, lacunar infarct in the thalamocortical pathway, and hemorrhage in the thalamus. These cases were unique in that CT scan abnormalities were found in patients with pure sensory stroke.
