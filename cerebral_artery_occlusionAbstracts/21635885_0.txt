Stroke is the third leading cause of global death and disability. Cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA has been shown to be up-regulated after stroke and also the time window of its expression extends from 4 to 12 h. The objective of this study was to elucidate the protective effect of Etoricoxib (a selective Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor) against transient middle cerebral artery occlusion induced behavioral, biochemical and histological alterations. Transient ischemia reperfusion significantly caused behavioral (neurological deficits, decreased locomotor activity and rotarod performance), biochemical (increased lipid peroxidation and nitrite concentration, while decreased superoxide dismutase and catalase activity) and histological (increased infarct volume) changes. Etoricoxib (3 and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reversed the alterations caused by cerebral ischemia however, 1 mg/kg dose was not found effective in any of the parameters. Finally, we can conclude that Etoricoxib has beneficial effects against transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model in rats. The present study indicates that Etoricoxib may be considered as a potential candidate in the treatment of stroke, clinically.
