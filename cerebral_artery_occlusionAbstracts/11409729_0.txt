Hyperthermia during or after stroke is known to worsen neuronal damage. Paradoxically, when hyperthermia precedes stroke, it can protect against a subsequent ischemic insult. Other stressors including restraint also have a similar pre-conditioning effect. In the present study, we report the unanticipated finding that conscious rats, restrained for the purpose of intravenous infusion, had markedly reduced neuronal and functional deficits after middle cerebral artery occlusion compared with unrestrained rats. Restrained rats had significantly higher body temperature prior to stroke than unrestrained rats. The findings suggest restraint leading to mild hyperthermia may be sufficient to induce adaptive processes which protect against subsequent ischemia.
