This study is focused on the survival of fetal neocortical grafts placed in the infarcted adult host cortex of the spontaneously hypertensive rat and describes the ability of host axonal regeneration into the graft after a focal ischaemic lesion. Five to seven days following ligation of the right middle cerebral artery, dissociated neocortical primordium from fetuses of gestational age 12-18 days was implanted into the infarcted cortical area. Surviving transplants were seen in all rats, although grafts derived from gestational age 12-14 days displayed an irregular morphology rich in sinusoid-like cavities and containing fewer cells of apparently mature neuronal morphology. Grafts from older donors contained perikarya of neuronal appearance; however, they lacked normal cortical lamination. Ten days postgrafting, fibers stained by acetylcholinesterase histochemistry, dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, and 5-hydroxytryptamine immunohistochemistry were found in the grafts, and by 10-23 weeks after transplantation the fiber density had increased substantially. When the retrograde tracer Fluoro-Gold was injected into the grafted tissue, labeled cells were found in several subcortical nuclei of the host, including the nucleus basalis of Meynert, ventral pallidum, thalamus, dorsal raphe, locus coeruleus, as well as the ipsilateral and contralateral neocortex. This study shows that grafts of dissociated neocortical tissue exhibit good survival and growth potential when implanted into infarcted neocortex and that several nerve fiber systems of the adult host have a regenerative capacity sufficient to innervate the grafted tissue.
