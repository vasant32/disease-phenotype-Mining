 BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that the novel neuropeptide orexin-A may play an essential role during neuronal damage. However, the function of orexin-A during brain ischemia remains unclear. Recently, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) was shown to be activated by orexin-A. The aim of the current study is to test the hypothesis that administration of exogenous orexin-A can attenuate ischemia-reperfusion injury through the facilitation of HIF-1α expression. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion for 120 min. Rats were treated with different doses of orexin-A or vehicle before the ischemia and at the onset of reperfusion. To investigate the action of HIF-1α in the neuroprotective effects of orexin-A, the HIF-1α inhibitor YC-1 was used alone or combined with orexin-A. Neurologic deficit scores and infarct volume were assessed. Brains were harvested for immunohistochemical staining and western blot analysis. RESULTS: Orexin-A significantly ameliorated neurologic deficit scores and reduced infarct volume after cerebral ischemia reperfusion. Administration of 30 μg/kg orexin-A showed optimal neuroprotective effects. This effect was still present 7 days after reperfusion. Furthermore, orexin-A decreased the number of apoptotic cells and significantly enhanced HIF-1α expression after cerebral ischemia reperfusion. Moreover, the facilitation of HIF-1α expression was accompanied with inhibition of von Hippel-Lindau expression. Administration of HIF-1α inhibitor suppressed the increase of HIF-1α and reversed the neuroprotective effects of orexin-A. CONCLUSIONS: Orexin-A has a neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. These effects may be mediated through the HIF-1α pathway.
