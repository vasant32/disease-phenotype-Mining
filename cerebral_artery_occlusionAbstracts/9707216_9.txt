BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In-bore middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) enables investigators to acquire preischemic MRI data and to image ischemic changes immediately after occlusion. We have developed a highly successful in-bore MCAO method. This study describes the methods and pertinent techniques. METHODS: Sixty-seven Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to temporary (n=36) or permanent (n=31) MCAO. The occluding device consisted of a supporting tubing, a driving line, and a silicone-coated 4-0 nylon suture occluder. Outside the magnet, the occluder was positioned in the carotid canal. MCAO was achieved in the magnet bore by remotely advancing the driving line until resistance was felt. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) were acquired before and immediately after occlusion and were used to document the presence of MCAO. RESULTS: Fifty-nine (88.1%) rats were successfully occluded, demonstrating hyperintensity on DWI, perfusion deficits on PWI, and no subarachnoid hemorrhage at postmortem examination. The average values of the apparent diffusion coefficient in both the frontoparietal cortex and the lateral caudoputamen significantly decreased as early as 3 minutes after the onset of ischemia. The failures included preocclusion damage (1/67), sliding out of the occluder during occlusion (1/67), no occlusion (2/67), and arterial perforation (4/67). CONCLUSIONS: Our in-bore MCAO method is easily performed and is as successful as MCAO induced outside the magnet.
