The potent and selective AMPA receptor antagonist NBQX was tested for cytoprotective properties in an adult rat model of transient focal neocortical ischemia. Nineteen spontaneously hypertensive rats sustained 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion, followed by 22 h of recirculation. Ninety minutes following the onset of ischemia, at the time of, and 30 min following reperfusion, they received i.p. injections of either saline (n = 10) or 30 mg kg-1 of NBQX (n = 9). Saline-treated rats had a mean volume of neocortical infarction ( +/- s.d.) of 181 +/- 31 mm3, while NBQX-treated rats sustained significantly less damage, 125 +/- 19 mm3 (p less than 0.001). Regional cerebral blood flows during ischemia and reperfusion were not affected by the drug. We suggest that the AMPA receptor may play an important role in ischemic cerebral infarction.
