OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of transplantation of immortalized neural progenitor cells (INPCs) into the brain with focal cerebral ischemia and the survival and differentiation thereof. METHODS: Twenty-four male SD rats underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and were randomly divided into 2 equal groups: INPC group undergoing transplantation of BrdU-labeled INPCs into the penumbra zone in striatum using stereotaxic apparatus 3 days after brain ischemia, and control group undergoing transplantation of PBS. Neurological severity score (NSS) system was used 6 hours, 1 day, and 3 days after MCAO, and 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks respectively after transplantation. One week after transplantation, 6 animals of each group were randomly chosen and killed with their brains taken out, the rest of the animals were killed four weeks after transplantation. The survival of INPCs in the brain was determined by double immunofluorescent labeling technique with BrdU + NSE or BrdU + GFAP antibody. RESULTS: The NSS values at different time points after transplantation of both groups were all higher than those before MCAO; however, no significant difference in NSS was detected between the two groups. BrdU + GFAP and BrdU + NSE positive astrocytes and neurons were detected in the INPC group by double immunofluorescent labeling technique 1 week and 4 weeks after transplantation. CONCLUSION: INPC can survive in penumbra zone in rats with focal cerebral ischemia and develop into neurons and astrocytes.
