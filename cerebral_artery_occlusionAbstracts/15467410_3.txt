OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of perfusion imaging of the brain using the Z-score and subtraction dynamic images obtained from susceptibility contrast MR images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five patients, each with a normal MRI, Moya-moya, a middle cerebral artery occlusion, post-trauma syndrome, and a metastatic brain tumor, were selected for a presentation. A susceptibility-contrast echo-planar image after a routine MRI was taken as the source image with a rapid manual injection of 0.1 mmol/kg of Gd-DTPA. The inflow and washout patterns were observed from the time-signal intensity curve of the serial scans using the standard program of an MRI machine. The repeated Z-score images of the peak and late phases were made using the threshold Z-score values between 1.4 and 2.0 in four to five studies of the pre-contrast, peak, and late phases. Dynamic subtraction images were produced by subtracting sequential post-contrast images from a pre-contrast image and coloring these images using a pseudocolor mapping method. RESULTS: In the diseases with perfusion abnormalities, the Z-score images revealed information about the degree of perfusion during the peak and late phases. However, the quality varied with the Z-score threshold and the studies selected in a group. The dynamic subtraction images were of sufficient quality with no background noise and more clearly illustrated the temporal changes in perfusion and delayed perfusion. CONCLUSION: The Z-scores and dynamic subtraction images illustrated the degree of perfusion and sequential changes in the pattern of perfusion, respectively. These images can be used as a new complimentary method for observing the perfusion patterns in brain diseases.
