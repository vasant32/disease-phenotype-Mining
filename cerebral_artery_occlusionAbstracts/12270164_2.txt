Nitrates exhibit a selectivity of action in different tissue types not fully recognized: in particular, the neuromodulatory and cardiovascular properties can be dissociated. A novel nitrate showed relatively weak systemic effects, but in the middle cerebral artery occlusion rat model of focal ischemia, reduced the cerebral infarct by 60-70% when administered 4 h after the onset of ischemia.
