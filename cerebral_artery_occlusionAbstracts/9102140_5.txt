Transient global cerebral ischemia has been shown to induce marked changes in the polyamine pathway with a significant increase in putrescine, the product of the ornithine decarboxylase reaction. This study examined the relationship between tissue and extracellular polyamines and regional cerebral blood flow and brain edema. Six hours of focal ischemia in cats (n = 10) was produced by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion. Extracellular polyamines were measured in extracellular fluid obtained by microdialysis. Regional cerebral blood flow using laser Doppler flowmetry and specific gravity, an indicator of brain edema, were measured in contralateral (non-ischemic), penumbra and densely ischemic brain regions. A significant increase in the tissue putrescine level was found in the penumbra but there was no difference in the putrescine levels between contralateral and densely ischemic regions. There was no significant change in the spermidine and spermine levels in the three regions. Extracellular levels of putrescine and spermidine were found to be significantly lower than the tissue levels and no change in polyamines was observed in any region. Significant edema formation was observed in densely ischemic and penumbra regions. This is the first demonstration that tissue putrescine is increased in the penumbra region, an area of incomplete ischemia that is developing brain edema.
