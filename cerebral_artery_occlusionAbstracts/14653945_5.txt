AIM: To study the expression of collapsing response mediated protein-4 (CRMP-4) and nestin in the ischemic adult rat brain following transient brain ischemia. METHODS: Brain ischemia was induced by transient left middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 60 min in adult rats. The expression of CRMP-4, nestin and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was analyzed by immunohistochemical method. The co-localization of CRMP-4 and nestin or BrdU was analyzed by double staining combined with confocal laser scanning microscopy. RESULTS: CRMP-4, a marker of immature neuron, could be expressed in the ipsilateral striatum and cerebral cortex at 1st and 2nd week after the ischemia-reperfusion; nestin, a marker of neural stem cell, occurred in above regions from several hours to 2 weeks. CRMP-4 costained with nestin and with BrdU incorporation. CONCLUSION: Neural stem cells may present in the striatum and cerebral cortex of adult rat and can be triggered to differentiate into newborn neuron there by ischemic brain trauma.
