OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether desferoxamine (DFO) preconditioning can induce tolerance against cerebral ischemia and its effect on the expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and erythropoietin (EPO) in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: Rat model of cerebral ischemia was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion with or without DFO administration. Infarct size was examined by TTC staining, and the neurological severity score was evaluated according to published method. Cortical neurons were cultured under ischemia stress which was mimicked by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), and the neuron damage was assessed by MTT assay. Immunofluorescent staining was employed to detect the expressions of HIF-1alpha and EPO. RESULTS: The protective effect induced by DFO (decreasing the infarction volume and ameliorating the neurological function) appeared at 2 d after administration of DFO (post-DFO), lasted until 7 d and disappeared at 14 d (P < 0.05); the most effective action was observed at 3 d post-DFO. DFO induced tolerance of cultured neurons against OGD: neuronal viability was increased 23%, 34%, 40%, 48% and 56% at 8 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, and 48 h, respectively, post-DFO (P < 0.05). Immunofluorescent staining found that HIF-1alpha and EPO were upregulated in the neurons of rat brain at 3 d and 7 d post-DFO; increase of HIF-1alpha and EPO appeared in cultured cortex neurons at 36 h and 48 h post-DFO. CONCLUSION: DFO induced tolerance against focal cerebral ischemia in rats, and exerted protective effect on OGD cultured cortical neurons. DFO significant induced the expression of HIF-1alpha and EPO both in vivo and in vitro. DFO preconditioning can protect against cerebral ischemia, which may be associated with the synthesis of HIF-1alpha and EPO.
