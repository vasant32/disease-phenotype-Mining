Infarct volume and immunoreactivities for trkB and trkC in rat brain were compared at 24 h after 90 min of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) between animal groups with or without neurotrophin-3 (NT-3, 10 microg/250 g animal). Treatment of rat brain with topical application of NT-3 significantly reduced infarct volume (P = 0.02) and trkB and trkC inductions. These data suggest that NT-3 reduced the ischemic injury along with the reduction of trkB and trkC inductions.
