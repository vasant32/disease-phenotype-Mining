The present study was designed to investigate whether electroacupuncture (EA) is able to regulate glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) expression following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry in rats. The results indicate that after 2 h MCAO, GDNF mRNA and immunoreactivity profoundly increased in peri-infarct cerebral cortex, with peaks at 2 h after reperfusion, then declined dramatically at 12 and 24 h after reperfusion. Although EA given immediatelly after MCAO couldn't elevate the peaks of GDNF expression, it obviously raised the GDNF mRNA and immunoreactivity levels at 12 h after reperfusion, delayed the declining trends of GDNF mRNA and immunoreactivity levels. These results suggest that EA could upregulate GDNF expression after ischemic insult, elongating the duration of upregulated GDNF expression. This may be one of the mechanisms of EA anti-ischemic injury by augmenting endogenous protective mechanism.
