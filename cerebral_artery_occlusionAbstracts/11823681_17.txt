BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Experimental evidence indicates that ultrasound can accelerate thrombolysis. We report our findings on early recanalization during transcranial color-coded Doppler (TCCD) continuous monitoring in acute stroke patients with middle cerebral artery (MCA) main stem occlusion. METHODS: We performed continuous TCCD monitorings in 6 consecutive patients with acute MCA main stem occlusion using a 2-MHz transducer. Patients were not treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. RESULTS: Partial recanalization, defined as blunted waveforms, occurred during monitoring in 5 patients (83%). The mean time to beginning of recanalization was 17.2+/-9.6 minutes. Complete recanalization at 24 hours occurred in only 1 patient. The mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score in the patients who recanalized during monitoring was 21.2+/-4.1 at baseline, 19.2+/-5 at 2 hours, and 15.6+/-3.4 at 24 hours (P=0.1). CONCLUSIONS: In this short series of patients with acute MCA main stem occlusion, not treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, we found a high rate of early partial recanalization during continuous exposure to 2-MHz ultrasound.
