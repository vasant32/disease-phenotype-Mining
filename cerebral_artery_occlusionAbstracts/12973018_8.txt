Because of observations that cultured neurons from mice deficient in the transcription factor E2F1 exhibit resistance after treatment with a wide variety of cell-death inducers, the authors investigated whether resistance extended to a cerebral ischemic insult. No differences in cerebral blood flow or physiologic parameters were observed in the mutant E2F1 littermates after the focal ligation. After 2 hours of left middle cerebral artery occlusion and 1 day of reperfusion, a 33% smaller infarct (P < 0.05) was observed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium staining in the brains of E2F1-null mice compared with their E2F1+/+ and +/- littermates. A milder ischemic insult produced by 20 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion and 7 days of reperfusion produced a greater difference in the E2F1-null animals with a 71% smaller infarct (P < 0.001) compared to littermate controls. A decrease in neuronal damage after mild ischemia in E2F1-null mice was observed by immunohistochemical monitoring of the loss in neuronal-specific microtubule-associated protein 2 cytoskeletal protein and the appearance of nuclear DNA fragmentation by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated 2'-deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling. This decreased brain damage was evidenced by improved behavior in motor function of E2F1 -/- mice compared with their E2F1 +/+ littermates by 7 days of reperfusion. In an effort to address the underlying molecular mechanism of the resistance of E2F1-null mice, the expression of several downstream proapoptotic target genes (p73, Apaf1, Arf) of the E2F1 transcription factor was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Although an attenuated increase in Hsp68 mRNA was found in E2F1 -/- mice, no changes in the proapoptotic transcripts were found after ischemia, and a mechanistic inference was not possible. The authors conclude that the transcription factor E2F1 does modulate neuronal viability in brain after cerebral ischemia and corroborates the findings with cultured neurons.
