We studied the effect of focal cerebral ischemia on the "state" of brain water using proton nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced in five halothane-anesthetized rats via tandem occlusion of the left common carotid artery and the left middle cerebral artery. The proton transverse relaxation time, the proton density, and the water diffusion coefficient were measured at various times from the same region of brain tissue from 1.5 to 168 hours after occlusion. Early measurements indicated significant changes in the transverse relaxation time (p = 0.004) and water diffusion coefficient (p = 0.002) of ischemic brain tissue compared with a homologous region from the contralateral hemisphere. However, the transverse relaxation time, proton density, and water diffusion coefficient in ischemic brain tissue showed different temporal evolutions over the study period. Diffusion coefficient weighting was superior to relaxation time and proton density weighting for the visualization of early cerebral ischemia. Our data suggest that nuclear magnetic resonance imaging is sensitive in detecting changes in proton-associated parameters during early cerebral ischemia and confirm significant changes (p less than or equal to 0.01) in the temporal evolution of transverse relaxation times, proton densities, and diffusion coefficients following middle cerebral artery occlusion.
