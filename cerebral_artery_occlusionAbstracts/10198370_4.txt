The contribution of glutamatergic and dopaminergic mechanisms to bladder hyperactivity after left middle cerebral artery occlusion was evaluated by determining the effects of intravenous cumulative doses of an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamatergic antagonist (MK-801) and D1-selective (Sch-23390), D2-selective (sulpiride), or nonselective (haloperidol) dopaminergic antagonists on bladder activity in sham-operated (SO) and cerebral-infarcted (CI) rats. MK-801 (1 and 10 mg/kg) or sulpiride (3-30 mg/kg) significantly increased bladder capacity (BC) in CI but decreased or had no effect, respectively, on BC in SO. Sch-23390 (0.1-3 mg/kg) decreased BC in both SO and CI. In both CI and SO, low doses of haloperidol (0.1-1 mg/kg) increased BC, but a higher dose (3 mg/kg) reversed this effect. Administration of haloperidol (0.3 mg/kg) or sulpiride (10 mg/kg) in combination with MK-801 (0.01-10 mg/kg) markedly increased BC in CI but produced small decreases or increases in BC depending on the dose of MK-801 in SO. These results indicate that the bladder hyperactivity induced by cerebral infarction is mediated in part by NMDA glutamatergic and D2 dopaminergic excitatory mechanisms.
