Ischemic stroke can trigger an acute phase response resulting in a rise of plasma concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP). Clinical data about the relationship between CRP and prognosis suggest that CRP might be involved in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia. In the present work, a significant increase of circulating level of CRP was observed in an vivo rat brain ischemia model of middle cerebral artery occlusion. To determine the possible effects of CRP on brain microvessel endothelium, we performed a dose-dependent experiment in mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells (bEnd.3 cells) with emphasis on its relation to cell adhesions molecules. Incubation with CRP (1-75 mg/L) for 24 h significantly increased Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage from bEnd.3 cells (P<0.01) in a dose-dependent manner, and induced significant up-regulations of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expressions analyzed by Western blotting (P<0.01). In contrast to earlier report, CRP also induced significant increase in ICAM-1 expression in the absence of serum (P<0.01). In conclusion, the present results suggest that CRP may be involved directly in the development of inflammation in response to cerebral ischemia.
