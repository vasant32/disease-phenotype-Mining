Our study is to demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in the mouse. CD-1 mice had permanent MCAO for 24 h, or temporary occlusion for either 1 h followed by 23 h of reperfusion or 2 h of occlusion with 22 h of reperfusion. The infarct volume and blood-brain barrier disruption were smaller in the 1-h/23-h temporary occlusion than in either the 24-h permanent occlusion group or the 2-h/22-h temporary occlusion group (p<0.05). Our study demonstrates that blood flow, infarct volume, and blood-brain barrier disruption remain important markers of focal cerebral ischemia.
