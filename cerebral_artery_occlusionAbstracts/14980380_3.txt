The role of nitric oxide (NO) in post-ischemic cerebral infarction has been extensively examined, but few studies have investigated its role on the neurological deficit. In the present study, we investigated the effect of spermine on the temporal evolution of infarct volume, NO production and neurological deficit using magnetic resonance imaging in a model of permanent focal cerebral ischemia in rats. Spermine given at 10 mg/kg 2 h after ischemia reduced the infarct volume by 40% and abolished brain NO production and improved the neurological score 24 h, 48 h and 72 h after ischemia. Spermine also reduced the neurological deficit as evaluated by rotamex, grip strength and neurological severity score tests.
