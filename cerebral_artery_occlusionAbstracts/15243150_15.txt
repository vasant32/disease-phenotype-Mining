BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH) is the most feared complication after tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) stroke treatment. Endogenous fibrinolysis inhibitors play an essential role in the coagulation/fibrinolysis balance and may be involved in the bleeding process. We aim to determine the predictive value of pretreatment levels of fibrinolysis inhibitors (PAI-1, lipoprotein(a), TAFI, and homocysteine) on SICH. METHODS: Consecutive tPA-treated stroke patients with middle cerebral artery occlusion were studied. Baseline blood samples were obtained just before tPA administration and fibrinolysis inhibitors were determined. A second computed tomography (CT) scan was obtained at 24 hours or when a neurological worsening occurred to rule out SICH. RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients (40% women, age 75 years) were studied. Median admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 17 (range, 7 to 22) and mean time to treatment was 160 minutes. Six patients (7.9%) presented with a SICH. In analyses based on clinical and CT variables, no relation could be found with SICH. When laboratory data were analyzed, patients who experienced SICH showed lower baseline PAI-1 (21.7+/-3.5 ng/mL versus 31.8+/-12.1 ng/mL; P<0.01) and higher TAFI (216.7+/-78.4% versus 162.1+/-54.2%; P=0.03). Homocysteine and lipoprotein(a) were not related to SICH. The only factors associated with SICH were TAFI >180% (OR, 12.9; CI, 1.41 to 118.8; P=0.02) and PAI-1 <21.4 ng/mL (OR, 12.75; CI, 1.17 to 139.2; P=0.04). The combination of admission PAI-1 <21.4 ng/mL and TAFI >180% had a sensibility of 75% and a specificity of 97.6% (P<0.01) predicting SICH, with a positive predictive value of 75% and negative predictive value of 97.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline PAI-1 and TAFI levels predict SICH after stroke tPA therapy. In the future, these biomarkers could be used to improve thrombolysis safety.
