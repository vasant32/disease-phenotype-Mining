The authors investigated the influence of age on the outcome of cerebral ischemia in wild-type mice and in mice with a deletion of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene. The middle cerebral artery was permanently occluded in iNOS-null mice and in wild-type (C57BL/6) controls aged 4, 8, 16, and 24 weeks. Infarct volume was determined in thionin-stained brain sections 4 days after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion. No differences in forebrain volume were found among wild-type and iNOS-null mice at the ages studied (P > 0.05). In C57BL/6 mice (n = 5 to 6/group), neocortical infarct volume corrected for swelling was 28 +/- 5 mm3 in 4-week-old mice, 28 +/- 3 at 8 weeks, 35 +/- 4 at 16 weeks, and 37 +/- 6 at 24 weeks (mean +/- SD). iNOS-null mice (n = 5 to 6/group) had smaller infarcts than wild-type controls at all ages (P < 0.05). However, the magnitude of the reduction was greater in 4-week-old (-29% +/- 10%) or 8-week-old mice (-24% +/- 8%), than in 16-week-old (-14% +/- 10%) or 24-week-old mice (-11% +/- 6%). Neurologic deficit scores improved significantly between 24 and 96 hours in 4- and 8-week-old iNOS-null mice compared with age-matched wild-type mice (P < 0.05). However, in 16- or 24-week-old iNOS-null mice, neurologic deficits did not improve (P > 0.05). The authors conclude that in iNOS-/- and in wild-type mice, the size of the infarct produced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery is larger in older than in younger mice. However, the reduction in infarct volume observed in iNOS-null mice is age-dependent and is greatest at 1 to 2 months of age. Therefore, age is a critical variable in studies of focal cerebral ischemic damage, both in wild-type mice and in mouse mutants.
