In order to provide a complete picture of pathogenesis in cerebral ischemia, cerebral cortex in MCAO rats were analysed for alteration in their proteomes. Comparative proteome analysis was used to compare signal corresponding to individual cerebral cortex proteins on a two-dimensional gel between MCAO rats and the normal control (NC) group. After sample preparation, two-dimensional electroghoresis separated proteins were stained with Commassie Brilliant Blue. The image data were analyzed on a Dell computer using Image Master v 3.01 software. In cerebral cortex, 30 proteins were differentially expressed in MCAO rats compared with NC. There were 11 spots significantly increased, 15 spots significantly decreased and Adenylate kinase isoenzyme 1 was detected only in NC group, biliverdin reductase B, small inducible cytokine A4 [Precursor] only in MCAO group. Peroxiredoxin 2 divided into two points in MCAO6h group. In the end, this approach may lay a foundation for the further investigation of pathogenic mechanisms in cerebral ischmic injury.
