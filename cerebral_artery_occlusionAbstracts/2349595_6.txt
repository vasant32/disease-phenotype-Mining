To enhance the consistency of the ischemic insult caused by reversible transorbital middle cerebral artery occlusion, we investigated the variability of somatosensory evoked potential amplitudes and regional cerebral blood flow in 26 anesthetized cats using four procedures to induce transient ischemia. These procedures included 60 minutes of left middle cerebral artery occlusion with or without left common carotid artery occlusion and 120 minutes of left middle cerebral artery occlusion with or without bilateral common carotid artery occlusion. Blood flow in the left middle cerebral artery territory was markedly and consistently reduced to less than 20 ml/min/100 g with simultaneous occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery and both common carotid arteries. The standard deviation of blood flow with this procedure (5.4) was less than that with the other three procedures (13-25). The amplitudes of ipsilateral somatosensory evoked potentials were decreased to approximately 20% of control during ischemia with all four procedures. During reperfusion, amplitudes recovered more slowly, to half of control, after both procedures involving 120 minutes of ischemia. After 120 minutes of reperfusion, the range of amplitudes was smallest in the group exposed to middle cerebral artery occlusion with bilateral common carotid artery occlusion. The degree of recovery of the somatosensory evoked potentials correlated with residual blood flow in both the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery territory and in the white matter during ischemia. We conclude that the most consistent model of focal ischemia and reperfusion in cats in which there is partial recovery of somatosensory evoked potentials is occlusion of one middle cerebral artery and both common carotid arteries for 120 minutes.
