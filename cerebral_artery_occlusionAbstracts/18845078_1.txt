AIM: To investigate the effects of adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC) transplantation on the angiogenesis in the brain post focal cerebral ischemia in rats. METHODS: 72 male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: sham-operated group, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group, vehicle group and MCAO+ADSC-treated group (n=18). A permenant focal cerebral ischemia model was established with the modified Longa's method. ADSC were labeled by DAPI before transplantation. One day after right MCAO, 30 muL of cell suspension containing 1x10(6) cells were injected into the lateral ventricle of MCAO+ADSC-treated group and the same dose of PBS was given to the vehicle group. On D4, D7 and D14 after MCAO, the rats were killed to detect the regeneration of microvessel and the expression of bFGF and VEGF in ischemic region by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. RESULTS: A lot of microvessel proliferate in the injured cortex reached peak in 2 weeks. The microvessel density in the brain tissues of rats treated with ADSC was higher than that in MCAO group and vehicle group (P<0.01). The expression of bFGF and VEGF in the brain tissues of MCAO+ADSC-treated group was higher than that in MCAO group and vehicle group on D4, D7 and D14 post MCAO. CONCLUSION: The transplantation of ADSC can promote the revascularization of cerebral ischemia in rats partly by enhancing bFGF and VEGF synthesis in brain.
