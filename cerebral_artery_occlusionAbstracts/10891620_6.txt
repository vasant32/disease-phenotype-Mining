An antisense oligodeoxynucleotide selective for the rat neuropeptide Y1 receptor gene was given into the left lateral ventricle in the experimental group of rats, whereas a missense oligodeoxynucleotide or saline was given in the control groups. Some rats were decapitated at 1-2h after the last injection of the oligodeoxynucleotides to examine their effects on the Y1 receptor density in the insular cortex. When compared to the Y1 and Y2 binding density of the untreated rats, the antisense-treated rats had reduced Y1 binding in the insular cortex but the Y2 binding was unaffected; treatment with missense oligodeoxynucleotide had no effect. Other rats underwent a right-sided middle cerebral artery occlusion at 1-2h after the last injection of the oligodeoxynucleotides or saline to examine the effect on the infarction volume at three days following stroke. The antisense treatment resulted in a doubling of the mean infarction volume when compared to the missense or saline treatment.Thus, reducing the Y1 receptor density prior to middle cerebral artery occlusion is harmful. Neuropeptide Y may mediate neuroprotection against focal ischemia via the cortical Y1 receptor, since the immunoreactivity for neuropeptide Y has been shown to increase within the peri-infarct cortex after middle cerebral artery occlusion.
