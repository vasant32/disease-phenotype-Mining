HT008-1 is one of the prescriptions used in Traditional Korean Medicine for the treatment of mental and physical weakness. It is composed of Panax ginseng, Acanthopanax senticosus, Angelica sinensis and Scutellaria baicalensis, which have been reported to have various pharmacological effects on the central nervous system. The study investigated whether HT008-1 has neuroprotective effects in a focal cerebral ischemia rat model. Stroke was induced in rats by 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) followed by 22 h of reperfusion. HT008-1 (30, 100 and 300 mg/kg) and the component herbs (300 mg/kg) were administered orally twice at 0 and 2 h after ischemia. Oral administration of 300 mg/kg HT008-1 reduced brain infarction by 45.7%, prolonged the latency time by 24.8% in the rotarod test, and enhanced the score by 17.0% in the balance beam test. Only P. ginseng and S. baicalensis showed protective effects, and HT008-1 showed a greater effect than its component herbs. HT008-1 down-regulated the COX-2 and OX-42 expression in the penumbra region. In conclusion, the results show that HT008-1 may be effective in a rat stroke model by an antiinflammatory mechanism and may improve sensory-motor function by reducing damage in the cortex and caudoputamen.
