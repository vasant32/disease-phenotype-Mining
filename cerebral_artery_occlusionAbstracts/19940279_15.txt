BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Risk of tumorigenesis is a major obstacle to human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cell therapy. Likely linked to the stage of differentiation of the cells at the time of implantation, formation of teratoma/tumors can also be influenced by factors released by the host tissue. We have analyzed the relative effects of the stage of differentiation and the postischemic environment on the formation of adverse structures by transplanted human embryonic stem cell-derived neural progenitors. METHODS: Four differentiation stages were identified on the basis of quantitative polymerase chain reaction expression of pluripotency, proliferation, and differentiation markers. Neural progenitors were transplanted at these 4 stages into rats with no, small, or large middle cerebral artery occlusion lesions. The fate of each transplant was compared with their pretransplantation status 1 to 4 months posttransplantation. RESULTS: The influence of the postischemic environment was limited to graft survival and occurrence of nonneuroectodermal structures after transplantation of very immature neural progenitors. Both effects were lost with differentiation. We identified a particular stage of differentiation characterized in vitro by a rebound of proliferative activity that produced highly proliferative grafts susceptible to threaten surrounding host tissues. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of the ischemic environment on the formation of teratoma by transplanted human embryonic stem cell-derived neural progenitors are limited to early differentiation stages that will likely not be used for stem cell therapy. In contrast, hyperproliferation observed at later stages of differentiation corresponds to an intrinsic activity that should be monitored to avoid tumorigenesis.
