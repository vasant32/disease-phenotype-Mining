An analysis of the multiexponential relaxation of transverse nuclear magnetization with and without a gadolinium-based paramagnetic contrast agent in spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats (SHR-SP) and in the rat model of ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion is described. From the multiexponential relaxation, the presence of two T(2) relaxation times in the range of 0.03-0.5 s, T(2A) (shortest) and T(2B) (longest), with very different relative weights (respectively, A and B), is evidenced. In our models of cerebral damage, the changes in A and B were more evident than those in T(2A) and T(2B). The two T(2) values were interpreted as belonging to water molecules in two different compartments; therefore, the difference between the damaged and normal regions revealed by means of standard T(2)-weighted images is suggested to be due to a different water distribution in the two compartments, rather than different T(2)'s. The T(2) relaxation in the SHR-SP stroke model is analyzed for the first time using a multiexponential method. The power of a detailed analysis of MRI relaxation times is confirmed by the correspondence between the revealed changes in T(2A), T(2B), A and B, and the known T(2)W and DWI results about blood-brain barrier functionality.
