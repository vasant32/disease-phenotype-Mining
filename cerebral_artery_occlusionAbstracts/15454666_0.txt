Stem cell lines have been and are being developed to treat damage in the central nervous system after stroke. Stem cells are able to migrate to areas of damage and to differentiate into neurons and glia. Grafts of murine stem cells have been shown to promote recovery from behavioral dysfunction after stroke. We have developed protocols to optimize behavioral testing, animal recovery, and stem cell delivery after middle cerebral artery occlusion. In this chapter we discuss study protocols aimed at integrating in vitro preparation of cells, small animal surgery, behavioral testing batteries, and histological analysis.
