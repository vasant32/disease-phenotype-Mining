The objective of this study was to assess whether delayed administration of ethyl eicosapentate has a favorable effect on cerebral blood flow and metabolism in rats suffering from cerebral infarction. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250-300 g were used. Left middle cerebral artery occlusion was induced for 2 h. After 24-h reperfusion, rats were treated with ethyl eicosapentate (100 mg kg(-1); ethyl eicosapentate treated) or saline (saline treated) by gavage, once a day for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, local cerebral blood flow and local cerebral glucose utilization were measured autoradiographically, and infarction size was measured. In the ischemic side, the local cerebral blood flow and local cerebral glucose utilization values in the parietal cortex and the lateral caudoputamen, which constituted the ischemic core, were equivalent to zero in both groups. The peri-infarcted areas, i.e., the frontal cortex and medial caudoputamen, were significantly higher in the ethyl eicosapentate treated group than the saline treated group. In the non-ischemic side, ethyl eicosapentate treated group had a tendency to improve local cerebral blood flow and local cerebral glucose utilization values in a medial caudoputamen. These results suggest that ethyl eicosapentate treatment may be beneficial for maintaining cerebral circulation and metabolism except for infarction area after cerebral infarction.
