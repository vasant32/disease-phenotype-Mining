 BACKGROUND: Our previous papers indicate that flurbiprofen axetil (FA), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, is a promising therapeutic strategy for cerebral ischemia in rats. This study aimed to investigate whether FA could promote a neuroprotective effect by activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) after focal cerebral ischemia in rats. METHODS: Totally 48 male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned into six groups (n = 8 in each group): animals in group ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) only received 120-minute transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO); animals in group I/R + FA were administered FA (10 mg/kg) by caudal vein just after 120-minute tMCAO; animals in group I/R + FA + GW9662 were administered GW9662 (a PPAR-γ inhibitor, 1 mg/kg) intraperitoneally 30 minutes before cerebral ischemia onset and FA (10 mg/kg) by caudal vein just after 120-minute tMCAO; animals in group I/R + GW9662 were administered GW9662 (1 mg/kg) intraperitoneally 30 minutes before cerebral ischemia onset; animals in group I/R + DMSO were administered 3% DMSO (vehicle of GW9662, 1 ml/kg) intraperitoneally 30 minutes before cerebral ischemia onset; animals in sham group experienced the identical surgery apart from the insertion of the nylon filament. The neurologic deficit score (NDS) were performed at 72 hours after reperfusion, and then mean brain infarct volume percentage (MBIVP) was determined with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) 10 g/L staining. RESULTS: NDS was significantly increased in group I/R + FA (12.0 (10.0 - 15.0)), group I/R + FA + GW9662 (10.0 (8.0 - 12.0)), and in group I/R + FA + DMSO (12.0 (9.0 - 14.0)) at 72 hours after reperfusion compared with those in group I/R (7.5 (6.0 - 10.0)). NDS was conspicuously different between group I/R + FA (12.0 (10.0 - 15.0)) and group I/R + FA + GW9662 (10.0 (8.0 - 12.0)). MBIVP in group I/R ((45.82 - 8.83)%) was significantly greater than that in group I/R + FA ((23.52 - 9.90)%), group I/R + FA + GW9662 ((33.17 - 7.15)%); MBIVP in group I/R + FA ((23.52 - 9.90)%) was significantly smaller than that in group I/R + FA + GW9662 ((33.17 - 7.15)%). CONCLUSIONS: FA confers the neuroprotective effect on tMCAO in rats and the selective PPAR-γ antagonist GW9662 attenuates the effect of FA. FA could promote a neuroprotective effect by, or in part, activation of PPAR-γ after focal cerebral ischemia in rats.
