Intravascular volume expansion has been employed successfully for treatment of ischemic stroke from cerebral vasospasm and from cerebrovascular occlusive disease. The physiologic mechanism responsible for this success has not previously been delineated in controlled experimentation. The objective of this investigation was to delineate the effects of cardiac output and of hemodilution in a primate model of focal cerebral ischemia. Two groups of anesthetized rhesus monkeys received extensive cardiovascular monitoring, and local cerebral blood flow (lCBF) was determined in both ischemic and nonischemic brain regions by the hydrogen clearance method. Both groups were subjected to unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion. One group then underwent blood volume expansion with Dextran 40 (cardiac output augmentation), and one group underwent isovolemic hemodilution with Dextran 40, cardiac output being maintained constant. Significant increases in lCBF occurred in ischemic regions only and occurred only in response to augmentation of cardiac output. Isovolemic hemodilution failed to produce any changes in lCBF. This investigation indicates that ischemic brain regions are selectively vulnerable to alterations in cardiac output, these effects being independent of alterations in blood pressure. Blood viscosity changes may play only a minor role. This study strongly suggests an important role of intravascular volume expansion and cardiac output augmentation in treatment of acute ischemic stroke.
