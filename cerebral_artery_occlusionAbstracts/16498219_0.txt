A 68-year-old woman with no history of cardiac events suffered acute myocardial infarction after surgery for middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion manifesting as transient left motor weakness. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple infarctions in the right cerebral hemisphere. Magnetic resonance angiography and cerebral angiography demonstrated an occlusion at the horizontal segment of the right MCA and no collateral circulation. Cerebral blood flow study 6 weeks after the initial presentation indicated decreased blood flow in the right cerebral hemisphere. Superficial temporal artery-MCA anastomosis was conducted to prevent recurrent cerebral infarction. Two hours after surgery, her systolic blood pressure fell to 60 mmHg and her consciousness worsened. Emergency coronary angiography indicated occlusion of the right coronary artery. Percutaneous coronary intervention was successfully performed and the subsequent course was uneventful. Preoperative evaluation of the coronary artery may be necessary before surgery for cerebral ischemic disease in both the intracranial and extracranial arteries.
