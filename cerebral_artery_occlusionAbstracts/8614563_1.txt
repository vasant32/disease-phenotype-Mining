To assess the interaction of nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide during reperfusion after cerebral ischemia, we studied the dose effects of superoxide dismutase (SOD) on the levels of nitrosyl hemoglobin and plasma nitrite + nitrate which were increased at 30 min reperfusion after 2 h middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats. SOD was administered at 10 min before reperfusion. With 1, 5 and 10 mg/Kg of SOD, plasma nitrite + nitrate level was decreased by 25 mg/kg of SOD. The same amount of apo enzyme was without effect. These results suggest effect of superoxide in the NO level released during reperfusion after cerebral ischemia.
