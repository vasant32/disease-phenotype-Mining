In the present study, we investigated whether activation of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channel is involved in the neuroprotective effect offered by early hyperbaric oxygenation after cerebral ischemia. The selective mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channel antagonist 5-hydroxydecanoate was infused intracerebroventricularly before hyperbaric oxygenation treatment initiated 3 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion for 90 min. Neurological status was evaluated and brains were removed for the measurement of infarct size and immunohistochemical evaluation of apoptosis 24 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Early hyperbaric oxygenation treatment improved neurologic deficits and reduced infarct volume, while these effects were reversed by the administration of 5-hydroxydecanoate. Furthermore, early hyperbaric oxygenation significantly decreased the number of apoptotic cells in the peri-infarct cortex 24 h after ischemic insult and this effect was also blocked by 5-hydroxydecanoate. The present findings suggest that early hyperbaric oxygenation therapy prevents apoptosis and promotes neurologic functional recovery after focal cerebral ischemia, and the opening of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channel plays a role in this antiapoptotic effect of early hyperbaric oxygenation.
