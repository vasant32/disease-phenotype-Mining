Stroke induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion leads to transiently increased progenitor proliferation in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and long-lasting striatal neurogenesis in adult rodents. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is upregulated in stroke-damaged brain. Whether TNF-alpha and its receptors influence SVZ progenitor proliferation after stroke is unclear. Here we show that the increased proliferation 1 week after stroke occurred concomitantly with elevated microglia numbers and TNF-alpha and TNF receptor-1 (TNF-R1) gene expression in the SVZ of wild-type mice. TNF receptor-1 was expressed on sorted SVZ progenitor cells from nestin-green fluorescent protein reporter mice. In animals lacking TNF-R1, stroke-induced SVZ cell proliferation and neuroblast formation were enhanced. In contrast, deletion of TNF-R1 did not alter basal or status epilepticus-stimulated cell proliferation in SVZ. Addition of TNF-alpha reduced the size and numbers of SVZ neurospheres through a TNF-R1-dependent mechanism without affecting cell survival. Our results provide the first evidence that TNF-R1 is a negative regulator of stroke-induced SVZ progenitor proliferation. Blockade of TNF-R1 signaling might be a novel strategy to promote the proliferative response in SVZ after stroke.
