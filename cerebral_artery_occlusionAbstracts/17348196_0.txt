OBJECTIVE: To explore the influence of one Chinese herbal extract complex (GETO) on the expression of corticotropin-releasing factor(CRF) and protein kinasec(PKC) proteins of the hippocampus in middle cerebral artery orilusion(MCAO) rats. METHOD: All rats were subjected to MCAO by nylon thread, except the sham-group rats. Rats were divied into four groups: sham-group, cerebral ischemia model-group, GETO-group(6. 1 g x kg(-1) x d(-1) )and Duxil-group (7.3 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)). Using immunohistochemistry technique we measured the expression quantity of CRF and PKC protein in hippocampus of MCAO rats at 2 h,6 h and 24 h after reperfusion, contrasted to Duxil. RESULT: CRF: There were lots of positive and deeper dyeing neurons in hippocampus of model-group rats, while there were a few of positive and lighter dyeing neurons in sham-group, GETO-group and Duxil-group. The positive expression areas of CRF protein in hippocampus of model-group was significantly bigger than that of sham-group, GETO -group and Duxil-group respectively( P <0. 01). PKC: There were a great number of denser positive granules in hippocampus of model-group rats, while there were a few of scattered positive granules in sham-group, GETO-group and Duxil-group. The positive expression areas of CRF protein in hippocampus of model-group was significantly bigger than that of sham-group, GETO-group and Duxil-group respectively( P < 0. 01). At the same time there was not significant difference about the expression of CRF and PKC protein between GETO group and Duxil-group. CONCLUSION: The high expression of CRF and PKC induced by cerebral ischemia may be one important factor that resulted in the delayed neuronal death in hippocampus. GETO can down-regulate the expression of CRF and PKC induced by cerebral ischemia, which may be one of the mechanisms that the Chinese herbal extract complex, protect cerebral ischemic injury.
