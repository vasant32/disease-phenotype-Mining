BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Findings that MHP36 stem cells grafted into intact parenchyma contralateral to the lesion induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion promoted recovery from stroke deficits led us to investigate whether implantation site of stem cells affects the functional efficacy of MHP36 grafts. METHODS: MHP36 cells (200 000/8 microL) were implanted in the left (n=8) or right (n=9) parenchyma or infused into the right ventricle (intraventricular; n=7) 2 to 3 weeks after stroke induced by 60 minutes of intraluminal right middle cerebral artery occlusion. Additionally, intact (n=11) and stroke (n=7) control groups were tested for 14 weeks in bilateral asymmetry, rotation bias, and spatial learning tasks before histological investigation of cell distribution and differentiation. RESULTS: Rats with left and right parenchymal grafts showed reduced bilateral asymmetry but no improvement in spatial learning. Conversely, spatial learning improved in rats with intraventricular grafts, but marked asymmetry persisted. No grafted group showed reduced amphetamine-induced rotation bias or reduced lesion volume relative to stroke controls. In all grafted groups, cells occupied both sides of the brain. A third of cells grafted in the striatum crossed the midline to occupy homologous regions in intact and lesioned hemispheres and differentiated into site-appropriate phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: After stroke, both the intact and lesioned hemispheres attract grafted stem cells, suggesting repair processes that utilize cells both for local repair and to augment plastic changes in contralateral motor pathways. However, differential effects of parenchymal and intraventricular grafts suggest that different mechanisms are implicated in recovery from cognitive and sensorimotor deficits induced by stroke.
