Arachidonic acid [20:4(N-6)] has been implicated in neurological damage induced by cerebral ischaemia. Membrane arachidonate concentrations can be reduced by changes in dietary fat intake. Therefore, in the present study, we have investigated the effects of N-3 fatty acid supplementation on neuronal damage induced by permanent focal cerebral ischaemia or pharmacological activation of striatal NMDA receptors. Weanling rats were fed either a control diet or an N-3 supplemented diet (1.75% by weight as N-3 fatty acids) for 6 weeks. N-3-supplemented animals reduced ischaemic damage following middle cerebral artery occlusion (36%, p < 0.05), and excitotoxic damage induced by infusion of the selective NMDA agonist (1-aminocyclobutane-cis-1,3-dicarboxylic acid, 43%, p < 0.001) compared to the control-fed group. These data are consistent with the proposed role of arachidonic acid in ischaemic and excitotoxic brain damage, and suggest that modest dietary supplementation with N-3 fatty acids may offer benefit to populations at high risk of stroke.
