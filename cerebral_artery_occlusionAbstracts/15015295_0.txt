OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of Erigeron breviscapus preparation on the imaging and neuronal metabolites after reperfusion in the ischemic cerebral injury in rats. METHOD: Twenty-three male Sprague Dawley rats with an average body weight of (165 +/- 15) g (mean +/- S) were used, and were randomly divided into two groups: group A rats (n = 11) underwent an operation of ischemic brain injury, group B rats (n = 12) underwent the same operation and received the treatment of Erigeron breviscapus preparation (1.5 mg.kg-1 weight, i.p.). The right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) of rats in both groups was induced by 5/0 nylon suture for 2 hours. The reperfusion was conducted for four hours and six hours respectively following MCAO. T2 weighted-imaging (T2WI) and 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) were performed, to study the changes of the imaging and the neuronal metabolites N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine/phosphocreatine (Cr/PCr), choline (Cho) and lactose (Lac) in cerebrum following cerebral ischemia. RESULT: The hyperintense signals in the right cerebrum in group B decreased compared with those in group A, the T2 values decreased, the level of NAA increased, the ratio of Cr/NAA and Cho/NAA decreased, and no lactose was observed. The brain surface vessels of rats in group B were in the state of dilation. CONCLUSION: Erigeron breviscapus preparation is beneficial to the reestablishment of the blood circulation in the ischemic brain, and to the improvement of the neuronal metabolism and survival.
