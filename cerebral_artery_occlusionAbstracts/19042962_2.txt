In view of the recent evidence for the involvement of histamine in cerebral ischemia, the present study evaluated the effect of thioperamide (THP), a selective histamine H3-receptor antagonist, on middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) induced focal cerebral ischemia in rats. The rats were subjected to 2 h of MCAO followed by 22 h reperfusion after which the grip strength, locomotor activity and spontaneous alternation performance were assessed. Animals were then killed and oxidative stress markers were estimated in the whole brain. An elevation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) and a reduction in glutathione (GSH) and antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione-S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), was observed following MCAO, the last two being statistically insignificant. Pretreatment with THP (5.5 mg/kg i.p. and 11 mg/kg i.p.) significantly reversed the MCAO-induced increase in TBARS, but could not reverse the other parameters. Paradoxically, it further reduced the levels of GPx, GR and SOD. No significant changes were observed in the catalase levels and in the grip strength and spontaneous alternation behavior of rats. Locomotor activity was reduced slightly, but reversed on pretreatment with THP. The dual effect of THP on oxidative stress requires further investigation and raises doubts on its possible use in cerebral ischemia.
