The effects of a paramagnetic contrast agent, gadolinium-DTPA (Gd-DTPA), on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of acute cerebral ischemia was investigated in a feline model of middle cerebral artery occlusion. Imaging was performed both before and after administration of an intravenous dose of 0.2 mmol/kg of Gd-DTPA. The animals were then sacrificed for pathologic correlation. No changes in intensity or relaxation times were noted before or after Gd-DTPA administration in two animals with 2 hours of occlusion. Infarcts were noted before and after contrast enhancement in all six cats with ischemia of greater than 16-hours duration. Gd-DTPA caused significant increase in intensity of infarct but not in that of normal cerebral tissue. Rapid enhancement was visible in infarcts of 16-24 hours, but such enhancement was slower in infarcts of 72-168 hours, presumably owing to slowed inflow caused by increased vasogenic edema in the latter group. Contrast enhancement of acute cerebral ischemic lesions with Gd-DTPA offers no improvement in sensitivity of MR imaging, although the conspicuity of the lesion may be improved. Additionally, contrast media may provide potential temporal and pathophysiological data for better characterization of cerebral ischemia.
