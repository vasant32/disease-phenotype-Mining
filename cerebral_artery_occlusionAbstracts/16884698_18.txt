Intravenous brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) causes a 65-70% reduction in stroke volume in rats with the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), provided the BDNF is conjugated to a blood-brain barrier (BBB) molecular Trojan horse. The latter may be a peptidomimetic monoclonal antibody (MAb) to the transferrin receptor. The present studies determine whether the effects on stroke volume correlate with an improvement in neuro-behavior using the rotarod test. The rotarod latency was >200 s at 16 RPM in all rats pre-MCAO. The latency was 30+/-7 s and 103+/-9 s at 24 h post-MCAO in the animals treated with BDNF alone and the BDNF-MAb conjugate, respectively. These studies show that when BDNF is formulated to enable transport across the BBB, the intravenous administration of the neurotrophin results in a reduction in stroke volume that is associated with a parallel improvement in functional outcome.
