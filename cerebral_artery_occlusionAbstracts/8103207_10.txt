The effect of the glutamate antagonist MK-801 on the ischemic threshold of energy metabolism and protein synthesis (CPS) was studied in rats submitted to 3 h occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). Local blood flow and CPS were measured by double tracer autoradiography, and local ATP content by bioluminescence imaging. In untreated animals breakdown of energy metabolism occurred at flow values below 15 +/- 1 and CPS inhibition below 51 +/- 15 ml/100 g/min (means +/- S.D.). MK-801 treatment (3 mg/kg immediately after MCA occlusion) did not change the ischemic flow threshold of energy failure (16 +/- 3 ml/100 g/min) but lead to a highly significant decline of the perfusion threshold for the inhibition of CPS to 19 +/- 4 ml/100 g/min (P < 0.01). Our data demonstrate that MK-801 dramatically reduces the threshold for the suppression of protein synthesis which could explain previously reported therapeutical effects on the reduction of brain infarct size.
