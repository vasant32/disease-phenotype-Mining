Berberine (Ber) 20 mg.kg-1.d-1 for 1, 3, or 5 d inhibited platelet aggregation induced by ADP, arachidonic acid (AA) and collagen (Coll) in rats with 24 h reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and the platelet adhesiveness was inhibited as well. Using radioimmunoassay method, the thromboxane B2(TXB2) and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) contents in rat plasma were measured 24 h after MCAO. The results indicate that the TXB2 levels after drug treatment were lower than those in ischemia control rats, but the 6-keto-PGF1 alpha levels showed no obvious difference between the two groups. The same dose of Ber was also shown to inhibit thrombosis formation. This suggests that the decline of platelet aggregation and decrease of TXB2 content may be one of the important factors involved in the anti-cerebral ischemia effect of Ber.
