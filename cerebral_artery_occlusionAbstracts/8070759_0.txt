Using the middle cerebral artery occlusion model, we studied the effects of Zuzhongping on experimental focal cerebral ischemia. Twenty-eight adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups: (1) Zuzhongping group (n = 9), (2) Saline control group (n = 10), and (3) Blank control group (n = 9). Group 1 and group 2 received via a gastric tube 1 1ml/kg/day of Zuzhongping and normal saline, respectively. The cerebral middle arteries on the right side of 28 rats were occluded with a bipolar electro-coagulater at sites 1-2 mm from the right olfactory nerve tract. Ischemic volumes were measured by an image analytic system when the cerebral ischemia had lasted 24 h. The results showed that the ischemic volume of Zuzhongping group was significantly smaller than that of group 2 and group 3, suggesting a protective effect of Zuzhongping.
