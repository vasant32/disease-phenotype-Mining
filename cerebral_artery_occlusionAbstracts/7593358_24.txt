Changes in neocortex and striatum were characterized over time following focal ischemia to the brain. Rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCA-O) and sacrificed 1, 3, 6, 12, or 24 h later. The affected tissue was processed for tetrazolium chloride (TTC) and cresyl violet staining, as well as for Western blots to detect calpain-induced spectrin proteolysis. Significant changes in cell size and spectrin breakdown occurred within the first hour of occlusion, with further, dramatic changes in these two early markers continuing over time. Initial evidence of cell loss was noted at 1 h postocclusion in the striatum and at 3 h in the neocortex. However, even in the center of the most affected portion of the neocortex, the majority of cells appeared to be intact through 6 h. By this time, a significant TTC-defined infarct also emerged. These quantitative data indicate that calpain-induced proteolysis occurs very soon after the ischemic insult, is correlated with earliest changes in cell hypotrophy, and precedes or occurs in tandem with evidence of significant cell loss. They also demonstrate that, while some cell loss occurs earlier than previously believed, the majority of cells remains morphologically intact well beyond what is typically thought to be the window of opportunity for intervention. The results thus raise the question of how long after the ischemic event pharmaceutic intervention might be employed to salvage substantial numbers of neurons.
