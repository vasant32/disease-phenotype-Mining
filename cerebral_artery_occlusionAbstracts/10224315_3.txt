Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) transgenic and alpha-difluoromethyl ornithine (DFMO)-treated rats were exposed to transient middle cerebral occlusion (MCAO) to examine the role of intraischaemic ODC-activity on the evolution of ischaemia-reperfusion damage. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data show that the damage develops slower in ODC transgenic than in DFMO-treated rats, which is not caused by a difference in perfusion. Furthermore, infarct volumes are smaller in the former animals one day later. These data support the idea of endogenous neuroprotective action of ODC.
