Both diabetes mellitus and hypertension are risk factors for stroke and also influence prognosis following stroke. Experimentally, hyperglycemia augments cortical infarct size in stroke models where collateral circulation exists, and infarct size in hypertensive rats is larger than in normotensive strains. Whether the deleterious effect of hyperglycemia is altered in the setting of hypertension has not previously been studied experimentally. The effect of hyperglycemia on infarct size in spontaneously hypertensive rats was examined in this study. Focal neocortical cerebral ischemia was induced by tandem right common carotid and middle cerebral artery occlusion. Preischemic hyperglycemia had no influence on infarct volume whether the duration of postischemic hyperglycemia was transient or prolonged. Although hyperglycemia increases infarct size in cortical stroke models where collateral circulation is available, this study demonstrates the effect can be modified by the presence of underlying hypertension.
