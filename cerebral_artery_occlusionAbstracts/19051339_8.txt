Both Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels (AS) and Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort. (LC) have been used to treat stroke in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. Ferulic acid (FA), a component in both AS and LC, plays a role in neuroprotection. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of FA on cerebral infarct and the involvement of neuroprotective pathway. Rats underwent 2 hours and 24 hours of reperfusion after 90 min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). The cerebral infarct and neurological deficits were measured after 24 hours of reperfusion. Furthermore, the expression of superoxide radicals, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), myeloperoxidase (MPO), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) immunoreactive cells were assessed after 2 hours and 24 hours of reperfusion. Administration of 80 and 100 mg/kg of FA at the beginning of MCAo significantly reduced cerebral infarct and neurological deficit-score, similar results were obtained by 100 mg/kg of FA administered 30 min after MCAo. FA treatment (100 mg/kg i.v.) effectively suppressed superoxide radicals in the parenchyma lesion, and ICAM-1 immunoreactive vessels in the ischemic striatum after 2 hours of reperfusion. FA (100 mg/kg i.v.) reduced the expression of ICAM-1 and NF-kappaB in the ischemic cortex and striatum, also down-regulated MPO immunoreactive cells in the ischemic cortex after 24 hours of reperfusion. These results showed that the effect of FA on reducing cerebral infarct area and neurological deficit-score were at least partially attributed to the inhibition of superoxide radicals, ICAM-1 and NF-kappaB expression in transient MCAo rats.
