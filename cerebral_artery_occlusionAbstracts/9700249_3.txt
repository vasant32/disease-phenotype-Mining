We present a case of right middle cerebral artery occlusion after a controlled ovarian hyperstimulation regimen and cryopreserved embryo transfer (ET) in a previously healthy 22-year-old woman. The patient suffered from nausea and progressive abdominal distension 8 days after ET. Under the diagnosis of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, she was treated with hypertonic solution, albumin infusion, and paracentesis, with some improvement. Left hemiparesis and dysarthria occurred suddenly on the fourth day of hospitalization, 11 days after ET. The neurologic deficits progressed to complete hemiplegia within a few hours. Computed tomography of the head showed infarction in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery. Magnetic resonance angiography revealed occlusion of the main trunk of the right middle cerebral artery. Laboratory studies showed leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance and a hypercoagulable state. The pregnancy was terminated because of progressive tachycardia, dyspnea, and increased abdominal girth despite supportive treatment. The neurologic deficits remained stationary at the time of discharge. This case emphasizes that the recent advent of ovulation induction and assisted reproductive techniques is a newly recognized cause of devastating cerebral infarction in otherwise healthy women.
