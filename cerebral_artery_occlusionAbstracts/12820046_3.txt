BACKGROUND: Many neurovascular procedures necessitate temporary occlusion of cerebral arteries. In this situation neuroprotective drugs may increase the safety of the procedures. Magnesium may inhibit ischemic damage by anti-excitotoxic, calcium channel blocking and vasodilatory action. Some evidence suggests that intra-arterial administration might provide a much higher degree of protection than intravenous treatment. In this study the neuroprotective efficacy of intra-arterial and intravenous magnesium administration was examined in a rat model of transient focal ischemia. METHODS: 34 male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 90 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) by an intraluminal thread. Before ischemia, animals received an infusion of either (1) vehicle (0.9% NaCl) (2) MgSO4 intra-arterially or (3) MgSO4 intravenously. Local cortical blood flow (LCBF) was continuously measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry. Functional deficits were quantified daily, infarct volumes were assessed histologically after 7 days. FINDINGS: There was no difference between the treatment groups concerning LCBF. Magnesium serum levels increased from approximately 1 mmol/l to approximately 1.8 mmol/l by either route of administration. Both intra-arterial and intravenous treatment improved neurological recovery and equally reduced total infarct volume by approximately 25%. INTERPRETATION: The results indicate that there is no advantage of intra-arterial over intravenous magnesium administration. A comparison with previous studies suggests that even within the normal range of serum magnesium concentrations, low-normal levels may be hazardous and high-normal levels may be protective in transient focal ischemia.
