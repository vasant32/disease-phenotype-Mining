We have previously shown that NS-7 [4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-methyl-6-(5-piperidinopentyloxy)pyrimidine hydrochloride] reduces the size of cerebral infarction measured by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining at 48 h after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. To determine whether NS-7 improves the pathological and behavioral changes at the chronic stage of MCAO, the effect of this compound on the cerebral infarction as well as the neurological and cognitive impairments was investigated 7 days after MCAO. Single or five daily injections of NS-7 (0.125-0.5 mg/kg, i.v.) significantly reduced the infarct volume and improved the neuronal dysfunction including the hind leg paralysis, walking disability and motor incoordination, and the deficit of passive avoidance task, although the neuroprotective efficacy was not different among these dosing regimens. On the other hand, the effects of single versus repeated injections of NS-7 at 0.1 or 0.2 mg/kg on the neurological symptoms were compared at 4 weeks after MCAO. At a lower dose, repeated but not single injection of NS-7 significantly improved the neurological symptoms, although the single injection was effective at a higher dose. From these findings, it is suggested that NS-7 reverses the behavioral and cognitive dysfunction observed at the chronic stage of cerebral ischemia by suppressing the cerebral infarction.
