To design a peptide disrupting the interaction between N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors-2B (NR2B) and postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95), a gene fragment encoding a chimeric peptide was constructed using polymerase chain reaction and ligated into a novel expression vector for recombinant expression in a T7 RNA polymerase-based expression system. The chimeric peptide contained a fragment of the cell membrane transduction domain of the human immunodeficiency virus type1 (HIV-1) Tat, a influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tag, and the C-terminal 9 amino acids of NR2B (NR2B9c). We named the chimeric peptide Tat-HA-NR2B9c. The expression plasmid contained a gene fragment encoding the Tat-HA-NR2B9c was ligated to the C-terminal fragment of l-asparaginase (AnsB-C) via a unique acid labile Asp-Pro linker. The recombinant fusion protein was expressed in inclusion body in Escherichia coli under isopropyl Î²-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and purified by washing with 2M urea, solubilizing in 4M urea, and then ethanol precipitation. The target chimeric peptide Tat-HA-NR2B9c was released from the fusion partner following acid hydrolysis and purified by isoelectric point precipitation and ultrafiltration. SDS-PAGE analysis and MALDI-TOF-MS analysis showed that the purified Tat-HA-NR2B9c was highly homogeneous. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of Tat-HA-NR2B9c on ischemia-induced cerebral injury in the rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and reperfusion, and found that the peptide reduced infarct size and improved neurological functions.
