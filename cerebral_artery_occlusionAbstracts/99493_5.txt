Following the massive increase in extracellular potassium activity that occurs in cerebral cortex when local blood flow falls below 8--11 ml/100 g/min, recovery of potassium toward normal levels might be expected when flow is restored. This study assessed the reversibility of such potassium increases, produced by middle cerebral artery occlusion in 13 baboons anaesthetised with alpha-chloralose, in relation to a wide range of ischaemic duration and density and post-occlusion flow. Potassium was measured with ion-exchanger microelectrodes and flow by hydrogen clearance. The artery was occluded for 136 +/- 63 min (mean +/- SD) and measurements were continued thereafter for 93 +/- 57 min without systemic hypertension. Upon reperfusion, partial or complete recovery (i.e., to within control confidence limits) of potassium was seen in all animals, but the rate of recovery varied widely and potassium clearance showed bi-compartmental characteristics in 7 animals. The fast component (or initial slope) rate constant was significantly correlated with post-occlusion flow and (inversely) with the duration of occlusion for which flow fell below the arbitrary threshold of 10 ml/100 g/min (the flow deficit). The slow component was unrelated to these quantities. Complete recovery was associated with a significantly higher post-occlusion flow, and smaller flow deficit, than was partial recovery. Secondary increases in potassium, associated with relatively high flow deficits and post-occlusion flows, were seen in 5 animals. These results are discussed in terms of factors that may determine potassium clearance and the possibility that elevated levels of potassium (demonstrated here to be prolonged well into the post-occlusion phase) might influence the evolution of a cortical infarct.
