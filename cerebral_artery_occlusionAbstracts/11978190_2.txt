 AIM: To study the expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEG F), angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), Tie-1, and Tie-2 in C57BL/6 mouse brain after permanent focal cerebral ischemia. METHODS: The mRNA levels of VEGF, Ang-1, Ang-2, Tie-1, and Tie-2 were measured by semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The protein express ions of VEGF and Ang-2 were determined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Low mRNA levels of VEGF, Ang-1, Ang-2, Tie-1, and Tie-2 were constitutively expressed in the normal cortex of mouse. After middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), the expressions of VEGF, Ang-2, and Tie-2 mRNA were dramatically increased in the infarcted cortex and the elevation was remained through 7 d of ischemia. However, the levels of Ang-1 and Tie-1 mRNA were unchanged in the infarcted cortex. Immunoreactivities of Ang-2 or VEGF were hardly observed in the normal cortex. Ang-2 protein was evidently detected in the infarct core 8 h after MCAO and in t he perifocal area 1 d after MCAO. Expression of VEGF protein was elevated in the infarct core 2 h after MCAO and in the perifocal area 1 d after MCAO. Immunoreaction was restricted to endothelial cells and glial-like cells within the infarct core and perifocal area. CONCLUSION: The expressions of An g-2 and VEGF are induced after focal cerebral ischemia, which may contribute to the angiogenic response in the cortex of ischemic brain.
