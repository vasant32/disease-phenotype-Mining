The effect on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesis of focal ischaemia in the right cortex of the mouse was investigated by performing a right middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. Synthesis of GABA was determined by measurement of the rate of GABA accumulation in tissue following injection of amino oxyacetic acid (AOAA; 30 mg/kg, i.p.). Five min following the MCA occlusion, the rate of GABA synthesis in the right (ischaemic) cortex was decreased by approximately 70% compared to either the left cortex or the right cortex of untreated controls. The basal GABA concentration was however unaffected. Four hours after the occlusion the rate of GABA synthesis was similar in the right and left cortex. The rate of GABA accumulation in the cerebellum was unchanged at both times after the right MCA occlusion compared with untreated control mice. The data suggest that there is a rapid but short lasting decrease in GABA synthesis following an ischaemic insult and it is suggested that this might be associated with the EEG spiking activity that occurs at this time.
