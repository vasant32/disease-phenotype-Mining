We investigated the neuroprotective effect of infusing various doses of clomethiazole in models of global and focal cerebral ischemia. In a model of global ischemia, gerbils were infused with clomethiazole (intravenous), attaining steady state plasma concentrations of between 1 and 13 microM for 24 h. In a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model in rats, clomethiazole was administered subcutaneously over 22.75 h using osmotic minipumps producing steady state plasma concentrations of between 1 and 13 microM. Clomethiazole was protective in these models at plasma concentrations of respectively 6.1 microM and above and 3.5 microM and above. Clomethiazole is thus neuroprotective in both global and focal ischemia at plasma concentrations known to be well tolerated in stroke patients.
