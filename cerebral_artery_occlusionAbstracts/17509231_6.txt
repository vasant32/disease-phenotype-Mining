OBJECTIVES: In the present study, we have investigated the neuroprotective potential of 6hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox), in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) induced focal cerebral ischemia. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 2 hours of MCAO followed by 22 or 70 hours of reperfusion. After reperfusion, rats were evaluated for neurological deficits and cerebral infarction. Brain malondialdehyde (MDA) level and in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) were also estimated. RESULTS: Focal cerebral ischemia produced a significant infarct volume and neurological scores as compared with sham-operated animals. Cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury was associated with an increase in lipid peroxidation in ipsilateral and contralateral hemisphere of brain along with an increase in TUNEL positive cells in ipsilateral hemisphere of brain sections indicating oxidative stress and DNA fragmentation, respectively. Trolox (10 and 30 mg/kg, i.p.) treatment significantly decreased neurological damage which was evident from the reduction in infarct volume and neurological score. Trolox (30 mg/kg) also attenuated oxidative stress and DNA fragmentation. DISCUSSION: Oxidative stress-induced neuronal damage is implicated in the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia. Our study suggests that Trolox is a potent neuroprotective agent in focal cerebral ischemia and its neuroprotective effects may be attributed to the reduction of lipid peroxidation and DNA fragmentation.
