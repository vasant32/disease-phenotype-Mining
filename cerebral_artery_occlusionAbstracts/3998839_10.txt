Focal cerebral ischemia initiates multiple detrimental effects in the brain. Chief among these are the regional development of ischemic edema, decreased local perfusion, altered neuronal function, and eventual infarction. To determine if pretreatment with the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, would result in improvement in these parameters, adult cats were given indomethacin or control solvent (4 mg/kg intraperitoneally twice daily) and were studied for periods up to 24 hours after right middle cerebral artery occlusion. The interaction of anesthetic agents with indomethacin was also examined in separate groups of experimental animals using pentobarbital and ketamine. In cats allowed to recover from pentobarbital anesthesia, indomethacin reduced gray and white matter edema at 6 and 24 hours after occlusion (p less than 0.05). This was noted in densely areas (indomethacin = 84.3%, control = 87.5%), "penumbra" regions (indomethacin = 82.5%, control = 85.3%), and in nonischemic zones (indomethacin = 81.5%, control = 82.3%) at 24 hours. Somatosensory evoked potential amplitude and central latency were also improved in the indomethacin group (p less than 0.05), as was cerebral perfusion (p less than 0.05). In animals anesthetized with continuous ketamine administration, cerebral edema and perfusion as well as evoked potentials were not significantly improved in any region by indomethacin. Regional cerebral blood flow in the group was increased by indomethacin in the nonischemic opposite hemisphere (indomethacin = 64.7 cc/100 gm/min, control = 48.5 cc/100 gm/min, p less than 0.05), but not in the penumbra region of the ischemic hemisphere (indomethacin = 15.0 cc/100 gm/min, control = 18.6 cc/100 gm/min, p less than 0.05), when measured 4 hours after occlusion. This suggested a steal phenomenon. Beneficial effects of indomethacin were evident in the presence of pentobarbital, but not after ketamine anesthesia. This suggests a synergism dependent on decreased arachidonic acid production from pentobarbital-stabilized membranes coupled with diminished production of cyclic endoperoxides from available arachidonate due to inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase with indomethacin.
