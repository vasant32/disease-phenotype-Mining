The ADAMTS enzymes (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1-like motifs) have important roles in central nervous system (CNS) physiology and pathology. This current study aimed to analyse the expression of ADAMTS-9 following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAo) in the rat, a model of focal cerebral ischaemia. Using real-time RT-PCR, ADAMTS-9 mRNA was demonstrated to be significantly up-regulated in tMCAo brain tissue compared to sham-operated at 24h post-ischaemia. The mature form of the ADAMTS-9 protein was only detected by Western blotting in brains subjected to tMCAo at 24h. In situ hybridisation demonstrated that ADAMTS-9 mRNA was expressed by neurones in tMCAo tissue. This study indicates that ADAMTS-9 expression is modulated in response to cerebral ischaemia in vivo and further research will resolve whether it plays a role in the subsequent degenerative or repair processes.
