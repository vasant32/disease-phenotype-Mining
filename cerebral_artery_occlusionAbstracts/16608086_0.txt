OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of Dachuanxiongwan on the expression of vascular epithelial growth factor in the rats after focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. METHODS: The ischemia and reperfusion model was established by blocking the middle cerebral artery of the rats with a nylon thread for two hours. Twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) were randomly divided into two groups. One of the group of rats were administered with DCXW, 4.13 g/kg x d, twice a day for 3 days by gavaging, while other group were given the same volume of saline as a control. Seventy-two hours after reperfusion, the neuropathological function of the rats were evaluated according to Longa. The rats were then sacrificed and the samples of cerebrum were processed and embedded in paraffin and cut into sections. The expression of VEGF was determined by immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: The score of the neuropathological function of the DCXW treated group (1.5 +/- 0.71) was lower than that of the control group (2.3 +/- 0.82, P = 0.032). More VEGF-positive cells were found in the rats treated with DCXW than those in the control group (P = 0.000). CONCLUSION: DCXW upgrades the expression of VEGF and may have a positive effect on the cerebrum following ischemia and reperfusion.
