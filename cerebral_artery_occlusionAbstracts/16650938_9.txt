Cysteinyl leukotrienes are potent pro-inflammatory mediators. Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 is one of the two cysteinyl leukotriene receptors cloned. We recently reported that cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 antagonists protected against cerebral ischemic injury, and an inducible expression of cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 was found in neuron- and glial-appearing cells after traumatic injury in human brain. To determine the role of cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 in ischemic brain injury, we investigated the temporal and spatial profile of cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 expression in rat brain from 3 h to 14 days after 30 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion, and observed the effect of pranlukast, a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 antagonist, on the ischemic injury. We found that cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 mRNA expression was up-regulated in the ischemic core both 3-12 h and 7-14 days, and in the boundary zone 7-14 days after reperfusion. In the ischemic core, cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 was primarily localized in neurons 24 h, and in macrophage/microglia 14 days after reperfusion; while in the boundary zone it was localized in proliferated astrocytes 14 days after reperfusion. Pranlukast attenuated neurological deficits, reduced infarct volume and ameliorated neuron loss in the ischemic core 24 h after reperfusion; it reduced infarct volume, ameliorated neuron loss and inhibited astrocyte proliferation in the boundary zone 14 days after reperfusion. Thus, we conclude that cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 mediates acute neuronal damage and subacute/chronic astrogliosis after focal cerebral ischemia.
