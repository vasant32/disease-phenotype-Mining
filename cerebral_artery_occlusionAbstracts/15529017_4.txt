Cortical application of KCl has previously been shown to induce tolerance to a subsequent episode of cerebral ischemia. KCl triggers recurrent episodes of cortical spreading depression and produces a small lesion at the cortical application site. To determine whether a cortical lesion alone is sufficient to induce tolerance to ischemia, the authors used 5-mol/L NaCl to precondition rat brain 3 days before permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. NaCl produced a small lesion at the application site without evoking cortical spreading depression. Preconditioning with 5-mol/L NaCl significantly attenuated the decrease in CBF after middle cerebral artery occlusion and reduced the volume of cortical infarction by 35%. The results show that a small cortical lesion, by itself, is sufficient to induce tolerance to ischemia.
