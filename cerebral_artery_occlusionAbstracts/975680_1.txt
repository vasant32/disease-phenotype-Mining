The radionuclide cerebral angiogram using intravenous radiopertechnetate has been found to be of value in confirming the early diagnosis of stroke. The isotopic perfusion study is of value in detecting ischemic carotid and middle cerebral lesions. It can also provide a rapid means of demonstrating intracerebral hemorrhages. Nuclear angiography is not recommended for detection of vertebrobasilar artery disease unless a posterior cerebral artery occlusion is suspected.
