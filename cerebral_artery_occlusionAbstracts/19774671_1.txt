Achyranthes bidentata polypeptides (ABPP), the important constituents separated from the aqueous extract of Achyranthes bidentata, have been shown to attenuate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced cell apoptosis in cultured hippocampal neurons through differential modulation of NR2A- and NR2B-containing NMDA receptors. The present study sought to investigate the possible mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effect of ABPP on NMDA-induced cell death. Western blot analysis and colorimetric enzymatic assay demonstrated that ABPP pretreatment inhibited NMDA-induced increase of Bax protein expression or caspase-3 activity in cultured hippocampal neurons. Fluorescence measurements after staining with 2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate and rhodamine 123 showed that ABPP treatment also reversed NMDA-induced intracellular radical oxygen species (ROS) elevation and mitochondrial membrane potential depression in cultured hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, the in vivo effects of ABPP on cerebral neuronal damage during focal ischemia-reperfusion were also investigated. In rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model, ABPP attenuated the increase in the neurological deficit and cerebral infarction induced by focal ischemia-reperfusion, showing in vivo neuroprotective effects. The results collectively suggest that ABPP might exert neuroprotective actions through inhibiting Bax protein expression, caspase-3 activity, ROS production, and mitochondrial dysfunction that are all caused by overstimulation of NMDA receptors.
