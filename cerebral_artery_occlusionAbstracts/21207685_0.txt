 AIM: To investigate the effects of electroacupuncture on the episodes of spreading depression (SD) in Wistar rats during focal cerebral ischemia. METHODS: A model of the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) in Wistar rats was performed with the intraluminal filament occlusion. The episodes of SD in focal cerebral ischemia within 3 hours and the effects of electroacupuncturing on "He gu" point (LI 4) were detected using neuroelectrophysiological method and neuropathological method. RESULTS: Electroacupuncture can reduce the episodes of SD during focal cerebral ischemia. CONCLUSIONS: Electroacupuncture can reduce the infarct volume of the focal cerebral ischemia, its mechanism may relate to reducing the episodes of SD during focal cerebral ischemia.
