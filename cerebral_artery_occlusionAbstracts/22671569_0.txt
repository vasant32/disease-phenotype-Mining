Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase substrate-1 (SHPS-1), also known as Signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα) or SIRPA is a transmembrane protein that is predominantly expressed in neurons, dendritic cells, and macrophages. This study was conducted to investigate the role of SHPS-1 in the oxidative stress and brain damage induced by acute focal cerebral ischemia. Wild-type (WT) and SHPS-1 mutant (MT) mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (60 min) followed by reperfusion. SHPS-1 MT mice had significantly reduced infarct volumes and improved neurological function after brain ischemia. In addition, neural injury and oxidative stress were inhibited in SHPS-1 MT mice. The mRNA and protein levels of the antioxidant genes nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase 1 were up-regulated in SHPS-1 MT mice. The SHPS-1 mutation suppressed the phosphorylation of SHP-1 and SHP-2 and increased the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3β. These results provide the first demonstration that SHPS-1 plays an important role in the oxidative stress and brain injury induced by acute cerebral ischemia. The activation of Akt signaling and the up-regulation of Nrf2 and heme oxygenase 1 likely account for the protective effects that were observed in the SHPS-1 MT mice.
