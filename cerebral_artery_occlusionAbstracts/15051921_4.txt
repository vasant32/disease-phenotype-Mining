DY-9760e (3-[2-[4-(3-chloro-2-methylphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-5,6-dimethoxy-1-(4-imidazolylmethyl)-1H-indazole dihydrochloride 3.5 hydrate), a novel calmodulin antagonist, provides effective protection against Ca(2+) ionophore-induced cytotoxicity and brain injury induced by transient focal ischemia. In this study, we evaluated the effect of DY-9760e on ischemic infarct volume in rats subjected to permanent focal ischemia. DY-9760e (0.5 mg/kg/h for 6 h) significantly reduced the infarct volume when administered immediately after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Furthermore, this neuroprotection was also exerted by treatment with a 3-hour delay, implying that the therapeutic time window for this compound is at least 3 h. In addition, although treatment with 0.1 mg/kg/h for 24 h was ineffective, the combination of a loading dose of 0.3 mg/kg/h for 2 h followed by 0.1 mg/kg/h for 22 h yielded a significant reduction in infarct volume. Thus, prolonged infusion preceded by a loading dose is an efficacious dosing regimen for DY-9760e, especially at a low infusion rate. These data demonstrate the substantial neuroprotective effect of DY-9760e in a permanent focal ischemia model and indicate that this neuroprotectant may be of therapeutic value for the treatment of acute stroke.
