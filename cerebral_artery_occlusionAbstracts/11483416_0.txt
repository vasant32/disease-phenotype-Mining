The purpose of this report is to highlight the utility of transcranial color Doppler sonography (TCCDS) in the emergency diagnosis of an ischemic stroke in a 64-year-old patient after head injury. An emergency CT identified a subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, a brain contusion and edema. The patient's status deteriorated after admission, and a second CT revealed an intracerebral hematoma and marked mass effect. Transcranial color sonography revealed no flow in the ipsilateral middle and anterior cerebral arteries, which was consistent with ischemic stroke. This case demonstrates that transcranial color Doppler sonography performed early after head injury may be useful in detecting associated occlusion of cerebral vessels.
