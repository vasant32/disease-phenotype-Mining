To detect the unintentional generation of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) during thread occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in rats, a single laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) probe was positioned over the ipsilateral cortex. Occlusion of the MCA resulted in an immediate drop of the LDF signal to 21.4+/-8.0% which was followed by a partial recovery to 31+/-11% in animals without SAH. In contrast, a sustained decrease to 7.4+/-5% (P<0.05 vs. non-SAH) occurred in animals with SAH. Thus, unintentional rupturing of the intracerebral carotid artery can easily and reliably be detected by single LDF monitoring immediately after MCA occlusion.
