The effect of intravenous transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells on the recovery of cognitive functions was studied in Wistar-Kyoto rats after brain stroke induced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in the left hemisphere. Analysis 2 and 5 weeks after stroke showed that transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells 3 days after middle cerebral artery occlusion reduced the area of cerebral injury, preserved cognitive functions, and decreased mortality in experimental animals.
