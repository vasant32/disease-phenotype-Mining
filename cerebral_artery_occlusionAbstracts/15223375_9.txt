The 150-kDa oxygen-regulated protein (ORP150), a novel stress protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is induced by hypoxia/ischemia. To determine the role of ORP150 in cerebral infarction following ischemia/reperfusion, ORP150 transgenic (TG) and knockout (KO) mice were subjected to 1 or 3 h of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion followed by reperfusion for 24 h. At 24 h after 1 h of occlusion, significantly less infarct volume was evident in cerebral cortex, but not in striatum, in ORP150TG than ORP150KO mice (P<0.001). Infarct volume did not differ significantly between these groups at 24 h after 3 h of occlusion. Immunohistochemical reactivity for microtubule-associated protein (MAP)2 in the MCA territory was lost in ORP150KO mice at 24 h after 1 h of occlusion. In contrast, MAP2 staining still was present in the affected cortex of ORP150TG mice, where markedly enhanced ORP150 immunoreactivity was demonstrated. MAP2 staining had disappeared from the affected area at 24 h after 3 h of occlusion in both groups, but astrocytic ORP150 reactivity was preserved in the ORP150TG group. At 6 h after 1-h occlusion, when MAP2 staining was evident in the affected cortex, some cortical neurons of the TG mice were reactive for Bcl-xS/L. Thus, ORP150 may be cytoprotective against ischemia/reperfusion injury via reduction of ER stress and probably also inhibition of apoptosis.
