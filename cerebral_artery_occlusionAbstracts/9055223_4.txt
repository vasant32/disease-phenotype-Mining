31P, 1H and lactate spectroscopic imaging was used to evaluate' the effects of hypothermia on focal cerebral ischemia produced by middle cerebral artery occlusion. The effects on high energy phosphate metabolism, pH, lactate and NAA were investigated in 24 spontaneously hypertensive rats subjected to either permanent or transient ischemia. Under either normothermic (37.5 degrees C) or hypothermic (32 degrees C) conditions, with permanent 6-h occlusion, there was little difference between groups in either the NMR measurements or the volume of infarction. In animals that underwent 3 h of ischemia followed by 12 h of reperfusion, the ischemic changes in lactate, pH, NAA, and high-energy phosphate returned toward control values, and there was a protective effect of hypothermia (infarct volume of 211 +/- 26 and 40 +/- 14 mm3 in normothermic and hypothermic groups, respectively). Thus, hypothermia did not ameliorate the changes in lactate, pH, NAA, or high energy phosphate levels occurring during ischemia, however, during reperfusion there was an improvement in both the recovery of these metabolites and pathological outcome in hypothermic compared with normothermic animals.
