Recent evidence suggests that exercise improves functional outcome in animal models of cerebral ischemia. Since netrin-1 and its receptors, deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) and uncoordinated gene 5B (Unc5B), act as important regulators in neural and vascular activities, we sought to determine whether netrin-1 and DCC and Unc5B are involved in the neuroprotective effects of exercise on rats with induced cerebral ischemia. A total of 108 rats were randomly distributed into three groups: sham-operated group (n = 12), middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group (n = 48), MCAO+treadmill exercise group (n = 48). Behavioral testing indicated that treadmill exercise could significantly improve neurologic deficits of rats with cerebral ischemia at day 14 and 28 after MCAO (n = 12, P<0.05 and P<0.01), but there was no significant difference at day 4 and 7. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot analysis revealed that treadmill exercise enhanced netrin-1 and DCC expression, while it suppressed Unc5B expression in rat peri-ischemic brain area, especially at day 14 and 28 after MCAO (n = 4, P<0.05 or P<0.01). Immunofluorescence analysis showed that in the peri-ischemic area, netrin-1 was expressed in neuronal perikarya, DCC, however, was expressed in neural processes and peri-vascular astrocytes, while Unc5B was expressed mostly in neuronal perikarya and some processes. These results suggest that netrin-1 and its receptors DCC and Unc5B may engage in exercise-induced neural circuit remodeling in the peri-ischemic area, and exercise may promote survival of neurons in this area by regulating netrin-1-Unc5B signaling. Additionally, netrin-1 may also play a role in brain-blood barrier via DCC-immunoreactive peri-vascular astrocytes. In conclusion, we demonstrate that treadmill exercise has beneficial effects that may be attributed, at least in part, to the involvement of netrin-1 and its receptors DCC and Unc5B in the neuronal and vascular activities in brain-ischemic rats.
