Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is a glycoprotein expressed on endothelial cells that facilitates leukocyte adhesion. To test the hypothesis that reduction of leukocytes in an ischemic lesion reduces ischemic brain damage, we measured the effect of administration of an anti-ICAM-1 monoclonal antibody on ischemic brain damage after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat. ICAM-1 expression increased in the ischemic lesion, and the lesion volume was significantly reduced by 41% in the anti-ICAM-1 antibody group compared with the control group (p < 0.05). Numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) were significantly reduced in the cortices of the anti-ICAM-1 antibody group compared with the control animals (p < 0.05). Our data indicate that administration of anti-ICAM-1 antibody results in a significant reduction of ischemic brain damage concomitant with a reduction of PMNs in the lesion after transient focal cerebral ischemia in the rat.
