Reperfusion therapy for ischemic stroke can cause secondary brain injury, especially under hyperglycemic (HG) conditions. Here we investigated the effect of acute treatment with rosiglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-γ) agonist, prior to postischemic reperfusion, on stroke outcome during HG stroke. Male Wistar rats that were either normoglycemic (NG) or HG by STZ (50 mg/kg; for 5-6 days) underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2 hours with 2 hours of reperfusion. Animals were treated i.v. with rosiglitazone (1mg/kg; n=16), rosiglitazone (1mg/kg) + the free radical scavenger Tempol (50mg/kg; n=10) or vehicle (n=16) ten minutes prior to reperfusion and infarct volume, edema formation and cerebral blood flow (CBF) were measured. Compared to NG, HG stroke significantly increased infarct volume from 5.2±3.0% vs. 14.7±3.6% (p<0.05). Rosiglitazone prevented the increased infarct volume induced by HG that was only 6.9±2.0% (p<0.05 vs. HG) but did not have any effect on edema formation that was increased by 3.0% in both HG vehicle and rosiglitazone-treated ipsilateral vs. contralateral hemispheres (p<0.05). Combined treatment of rosiglitazone + Tempol did not significantly change brain water content that remained 2.2% greater than contralateral (p<0.05), but reversed the neuroprotective properties of rosiglitazone in HG MCAO animals such that infarct volume was 14.3±4.4% (p>0.05 vs. vehicle). The lack of an effect of combined treatment of rosiglitazone + Temple may be due to a decrease in reperfusion CBF that was only 60% of baseline (p<0.01) compared to 82% and 89% for HG vehicle and rosiglitazone treated animals (p>0.05). In conclusion, acute rosiglitazone treatment prior reperfusion was neuroprotective but not vascular protective during HG stroke.
