An investigation was performed to compare the cerebral protective properties of etomidate, isoflurane, and thiopental. In separate groups of spontaneously hypertensive rats, etomidate, isoflurane, or thiopental was administered to achieve and maintain burst-suppression of the electroencephalogram (3-5 bursts/min) for the duration of the experiment. A fourth group received 1.2 minimal alveolar concentration halothane. All groups underwent 3 hours of middle cerebral artery occlusion and then 2 hours of reperfusion. Thereafter, the animals were killed and the volume of injured brain was determined by staining with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium. Physiological parameters did not differ among the four groups during the investigation, with the exception that hemolysis occurred in the etomidate group (free hemoglobin levels, approximately 0.4 g.dl-1). The volume of injured brain in the thiopental group (56 +/- 10 mm3) was significantly smaller than that in the halothane control group (99 +/- 13 mm3). The volumes of injured brain in the etomidate and isoflurane groups (145 +/- 11 mm3 and 139 +/- 14 mm3, respectively) were significantly larger than those in the control and thiopental groups. We speculate that the apparently detrimental effect of etomidate may be the result of the binding of nitric oxide of cerebral endothelial origin by the iron component of free hemoglobin. Intracranial pressure was not recorded, and in the isoflurane group, there may have been adverse effects on cerebral perfusion pressure associated with vasodilation caused by high concentrations of isoflurane. The results are consistent with a protective effect by barbiturates.
