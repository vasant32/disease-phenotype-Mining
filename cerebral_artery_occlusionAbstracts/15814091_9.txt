Solifenacin succinate [YM905, (+)-(1S,3'R)-quinuclidin-3'-yl 1-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-2-carboxylate monosuccinate] is a novel muscarinic receptor antagonist. We examined the effects of solifenacin and two other muscarinic receptor antagonists, tolterodine and propiverine, on detrusor overactivity in cerebral infarcted rats. Evaluation was done under conscious conditions using cystometry 1 day after middle cerebral artery occlusion. The cerebral infarcted rats showed decreases in bladder capacity and voided volume and an increase in residual volume, but no change in micturition pressure. Solifenacin increased bladder capacity and voided volume at doses of 0.03 mg/kg i.v. or more. Tolterodine increased bladder capacity and voided volume at 0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg i.v., while propiverine increased bladder capacity and voided volume at 1 mg/kg i.v. and at 0.3 and 1 mg/kg i.v., respectively. In contrast, none of the three drugs affected residual volume or micturition pressure. These results suggest that solifenacin may improve detrusor overactivity without causing urinary retention and may be a promising drug in the treatment of patients with overactive bladder syndrome.
