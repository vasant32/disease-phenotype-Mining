We characterized the effect of acute ischemic stroke on the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and evaluated the role of glucocorticoids (GC) in the clinical outcome following ischemic stroke. Male spontaneous hypertensive rats underwent permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (PMCAO) and developed a cortical infarct. At 4h post-PMCAO or sham operation, serum levels of ACTH and corticosterone (CS) were elevated 5 and 4 fold respectively as compared to controls and then returned to basal levels at 24h post surgery. In these experimental groups we found also a significant depletion of median eminence (ME)-CRH(41). In adrenalectomized (Adx) rats that underwent PMCAO the degree of motor disability and infarct volume was similar to that of intact rats. Administration of dexamethasone (Dex) to Adx-PMCAO rats significantly improved the motor disability and decreased the infarct volume. However, in sham-Adx with PMCAO, Dex had no effect on these two parameters. In rats with PMCAO or sham-PMCAO, brain production of PGE(2) was significantly increased. This effect was further enhanced in Adx-PMCAO rats and significantly inhibited by Dex. In conclusion, activation of the HPA axis following PMCAO is due to stress induced by surgery. This activation is mediated by hypothalamic CRH(41). Absence of endogenous GC or administration of Dex in na√Øve rats does not alter motor and pathological parameters in the acute stage following PMCAO. In contrast, administration of Dex significantly improved the outcome following cerebral ischemia in Adx rats which may be due to increased glucocorticoid receptors. Brain production of PGE(2) does not play an important role in the pathophysiology of the acute phase of cerebral ischemia.
