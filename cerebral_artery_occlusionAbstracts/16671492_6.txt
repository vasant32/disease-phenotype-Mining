The protein kinase C activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), is known to interact with aquaporin-4 (AQP4), a water-selective transporting protein abundant in astrocytes and ependymal cells, that has been found to decrease osmotically-induced swelling. The purpose of this study was to examine whether PMA given at different time points following focal ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) reduces brain edema by AQP4 modulation. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to sham procedure, vehicle, or PMA infusion (230 microg/kg), starting either 60 minutes before, or 30 or 60 minutes after MCAO (each group n = 12). After a 2-hour period of ischemia and 2 hours of reperfusion, the animals were sacrificed for assessment of brain water content, sodium, and potassium concentrations. AQP4 expression was assessed by immunoblotting. Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test. PMA treatment significantly reduced brain water content concentration in the infarcted area when started before or 30 minutes post-occlusion (p < 0.001, p = 0.022) and prevented the subsequent sodium shift (p < 0.05). Furthermore, PMA reduced ischemia-induced AQP4 up-regulation (p < 0.05). Attenuation of the ischemia-induced AQP4 up-regulation by PMA suggests that the reduction in brain edema formation following PMA treatment was at least in part mediated by AQP4 modulation.
