Stroke often results in devastating neurological disabilities with no specific treatment available to improve functional recovery. Neurite growth inhibitory proteins such as Nogo-A play a critical role in impeding regain of function after stroke. We have reported that treatment with anti-Nogo-A antibody using the intracerebroventricular route resulted in improvement of function and neuroplasticity in adult or aged rats after stroke. This present study tested a more clinically accessible route for applying anti-Nogo-A antibodies, the intrathecal route. Anti-Nogo-A or control antibody was administered intrathecally at lower lumbar levels 1 week after middle cerebral artery occlusion in adult rats. Our results show that anti-Nogo-A antibody delivered by this intrathecal route for 2 weeks penetrated into brain parenchyma and bound to myelin-enriched structures such as the corpus callosum and striatal white matter. Animals receiving anti-Nogo-A antibody treatment significantly improved recovery of function on the skilled forelimb reaching task as compared to stroke only and stroke/control antibody animals. These findings show that anti-Nogo-A antibody delivered through the intrathecal route is as effective in restoring lost functions after stroke as the intracerebroventricular route. This is of great importance for the future application of anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy for ischemic stroke treatment.
