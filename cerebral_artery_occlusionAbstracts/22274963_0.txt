 AIM: NKN reduces brain edema, neuronal death and neurological deficits in rats     after cerebral ischemia. In the present study, we investigated whether NKN was     effective on brain injury in cerebral ischemia rats. MATERIAL and METHODS: The     middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was used to produce experimental     cerebral ischemia in adult male Wistar rats. The activity of SOD and     concentration of MDA were determined. We also examined the efficacy of NKN on     neurological deficit scores, expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor and     endothelin-1 mRNA in brain of focal cerebral ischemia rats. RESULTS: The results     show that NKN significantly increased the activity of SOD, decreased the     concentration of MDA, decreased neurological deficit scores, inhibited the     expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor and endothelin-1 mRNA in brain of     focal cerebral ischemia rats. CONCLUSION: The results implied NKN could protect     brain against injury caused by cerebral ischemia.
