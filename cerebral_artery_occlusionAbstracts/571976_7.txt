Cerebral infarction was documented by arteriography and serial computed cranial tomography (CT) in four young adults (ages 16 to 32 years) with migraine. In one case, posterior cerebral artery occlusion produced a deep parietotemporal infarct. The other three cases all had frontotemporal infarcts (one hemorrhagic) in the territory of the middle cerebral artery, without major arterial occlusion. Two infarcts produced lasting neurologic deficits; one was associated with mild, transitory symptoms, and one was asymtomatic. Laboratory investigations in two cases revealed no hematologic or cardiovascular predisposition to cerebrovascular disease. Cerebral infarction, as revealed by CT, may be more prevalent in "complicated" migraine than is generally appreciated. Such lesions may or may not develop in chronologic and anatomic relationship to the headache, and may involve either large or small arteries. The prognosis for functional recovery, based on this limited sample, seems favorable.
