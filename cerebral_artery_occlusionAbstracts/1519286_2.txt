BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to use magnetoencephalography to record magnetic field changes in the brain during middle cerebral artery occlusion. METHODS: A direct-current electrocorticogram (two channels) and a direct-current magnetoencephalogram (seven channels) were simultaneously recorded from five rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion for 1-2 hours. RESULTS: Direct-current electrocorticographic and direct-current magnetoencephalographic signal deflections were observed after the onset of middle cerebral artery occlusion and occurred repeatedly throughout the ischemic period, with a mean +/- SD time interval of 12 +/- 5 minutes. A one-to-one correspondence of the electrocorticographic and magnetoencephalographic signal deflections was demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: Direct-current magnetoencephalography can provide a new noninvasive technique for studying depolarization and/or spreading depression in focal cerebral ischemia.
