Highly polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) is transiently expressed specifically in newly generated cells, and is important for migration and neurite outgrowth. To investigate the effect of aging on the migration of neural stem cell (NSC) after brain ischemia, the spatiotemporal expressions of immunoreactive PSA-NCAM were examined at 4 h or 1, 3 or 7 days after 90 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the young-adult or aged rats. In the sham control brain, PSA-NCAM staining was slightly observed both in dorsal and ventral parts of subventricular zone (SVZ) in the aged brain, but only in the dorsal part of SVZ in the young brain. After transient MCAO, immunoreactivity for PSA-NCAM increased in the number and the intensity in SVZ ipsilateral to MCAO in the young-adult brains and became the peak at 1 day, while that was at 3 days in the aged brains. These findings suggest that PSA-NCAM was located in different spatial distribution in normal condition between young and old rats. PSA-NCAM was induced after ischemia, and the temporal expression was also different after transient MCAO between young and older rats.
