Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) have been used for thrombolitic therapy. In contrast, it is suggested that these compounds might be involved in neuronal cell damage. The activation and the function of tPA and uPA are less understood in ischemic brain tissue. Therefore, changes in tPA and uPA mRNA in rat brain tissue after MCA occlusion and in the neuronal cell line, PC12 cells, during the hypoxic stimulation were examined. Permanent middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion was induced by advancing a filament into the internal carotid artery in 36 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. The ischemic cerebral cortex and contralateral cortex of MCA area, and bilateral hippocampus were collected at 0 (controls), 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h after occlusion. Hypoxia was induced in PC12 cells with a multigas incubator (set to 1% O2). The quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction acted as a measurement of alteration in mRNA levels. The mRNA levels of tPA and uPA were significantly increased after MCA occlusion in the ischemic cerebral cortex. The magnitude of the increase in tPA and uPA mRNA in 24 h after occlusion was twice the value in sham-operated rat (0 h). The increases of tPA mRNA were time-dependent in insult and contralateral hippocampus. The increase of uPA mRNA was also seen in the hippocampus bilaterally, although the increase was more significant on the ipsilateral side. In PC12 cells, necrotic (approximately 35%) and apoptotic cells (approximately 65%) could be distinguished by hypoxic stimulus for 24 h, and the mRNA for tPA was significantly increased for 6 h-12 h, while the mRNA for uPA was not detected at any point in the study. Our results suggest that focal ischemia might result in the activation of these proteases not only in the insult but also in the contralateral brain tissue.
