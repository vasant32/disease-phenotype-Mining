-Previous studies suggested that atrial natriuretic peptide gene (Anp) and brain natriuretic peptide gene (Bnp) are plausible candidate genes for susceptibility to stroke and for sensitivity to brain ischemia in the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRSP). We performed structural and functional analyses of these 2 genes in SHRSP from Glasgow colonies (SHRSPGla) and Wistar-Kyoto rats from Glasgow colonies (WKYGla) and developed a radiation hybrid map of the relevant region of rat chromosome 5. Sequencing of the coding regions of the Anp and Bnp genes revealed no difference between the 2 strains. Expression studies in brain tissue showed no differences at baseline and at 24 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) did not differ between the SHRSPGla and WKYGla, whereas concentrations of brain natriuretic peptide were significantly higher in the SHRSPGla as compared with the WKYGla (n=11 to 14; 163+/-21 pg/mL and 78+/-14 pg/mL; 95% confidence interval 31 to 138, P=0.003). We did not detect any attenuation of endothelium-dependent relaxations to bradykinin or ANP in middle cerebral arteries from the SHRSPGla; indeed the sensitivity to ANP was significantly increased in arteries harvested from this strain (WKYGla: n=8; pD2=7. 3+/-0.2 and SHRSPGla: n=8; pD2=8.2+/-0.15; P<0.01). Moreover, radiation hybrid mapping and fluorescence in situ hybridization allowed us to map the Anf marker in the telomeric position of rat chromosome 5 in close proximity to D5Rat48, D5Rat47, D5Mgh15, and D5Mgh16. These results exclude Anp and Bnp as candidate genes for the sensitivity to brain ischemia and pave the way to further congenic and physical mapping strategies.
