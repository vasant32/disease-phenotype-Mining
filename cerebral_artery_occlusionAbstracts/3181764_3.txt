The effect of aging on collateral circulation via pial anastomoses after middle cerebral artery occlusion was investigated in young and aged cats. The reduction of blood flow and electroencephalography power were greater and collateral vessel resistance was higher in the aged group than the young group. Electroencephalography power after the occlusion was correlated with collateral resistance and blood flow in the two groups. These results suggest that collateral function deteriorates with aging and the high vulnerability to ischemic insult in aged brain may be caused in part by the poor collateral function.
