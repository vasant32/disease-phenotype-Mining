Axonal injury following cerebral ischaemia has attracted less attention than damage in grey matter. However, it is becoming increasingly recognised that axons are highly vulnerable to focal ischaemia [D. Dewar, D.A. Dawson, Changes of cytoskeletal protein immunostaining in myelinated fibre tracts after focal cerebral ischaemia in the rat, Acta. Neuropathol., 93 (1997) 71-77] [2]; [L. Pantoni, J.H. Garcia, J.A. Gutierrez, Cerebral white matter is highly vulnerable to ischemia, Stroke, 27 (1996) 1641-1647] [10]; [P. S. Yam, T. Takasago, D. Dewar, D.I. Graham, J. McCulloch, Amyloid precursor protein accumulates in white matter at the margin of a focal ischaemic lesion, Brain Res., 760 (1997) 150-157] [15]. Since white matter does not contain neuronal cell bodies or synapses it is likely that the mechanisms of injury and strategies for its protection are different from those in grey matter. In order that the effect of therapeutic intervention on the protection of axons can be assessed, a method by which axonal injury can be mapped and quantified is required. For this purpose, we investigated immunocytochemical methods using amyloid precursor protein (APP) following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat. APP is transported by fast anterograde axonal transport [E.H. Koo, S.S. Sisodia, D.R. Archer, L.J. Martin, A. Weidemann, K. Beyreuther, P. Fischer, C.L. Masters, D.L. Price, Precursor of amyloid protein in Alzheimer disease undergoes fast anterograde axonal transport, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87 (1990) 1561-1565] [7] and has been shown to accumulate following a variety of insults to axons, indicative of dysfunction of axonal transport [R.N. Kalaria, S.U. Bhatti, E.A. Palatinsky, D.H. Pennington, E.R. Shelton, H.W. Chan, G. Perry, W.D. Lust, Accumulation of the beta amyloid precursor protein at sites of ischemic injury in rat brain, Neuroreport, 4 (1993) 211-214] [4]; [T. Kawarabayashi, M. Shoji, Y. Harigaya, H. Yamaguchi, S. Hirai, Expression of APP in the early stage of brain damage, Brain Res., 563 (1991) 334-338] [5]; [N. Otsuka, M. Tomonaga, K. Ikeda, Rapid appearance of beta-amyloid precursor protein immunoreactivity in damaged axons and reactive glial cells in rat brain following needle stab injury, Brain Res., 568 (1991) 335-338] [9]; [K. Shigematsu, P. L. McGeer, Accumulation of amyloid precursor protein in neurons after intraventricular injection of colchicine, Am. J. Pathol., 140 (1992) 787-794] [12]. We have been able to map the topographical relationship between APP accumulation and region of infarction using immunocytochemistry and image analysis techniques. Additionally, using a semi-quantitative scoring system, we have demonstrated that there is a relationship between the amount of APP accumulation and the volume of infarction following middle cerebral artery occlusion. These methods will be useful in the future for the assessment of therapeutic interventions on the protection of axons following ischaemic injury.
