We have studied the forms of cell death following ischemia/reperfusion, and the influence of diabetes mellitus (DM) as an additional factor. Based on the models of diabetes and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), characteristics of cell death after ischemia/reperfusion were evaluated synthetically by different methods: pathology, FCM, TUNEL and DNA agarose electrophoresis. The results showed that the occurrence of cerebral injury after ischemia/reperfusion was accompanied by cell necrosis and cell apoptosis. Cell apoptosis was mainly located in the ischemic penumbral (IP) zone around the densely ischemic focus. The ischemic core was characterized by cell necrosis. At the same time, the results showed that the process of ischemic cerebral injury worsened by DM was related to inducing cell apoptosis in IP and mid zone. In conclusion, there existed not only cell apoptosis but cell necrosis in brain damage following focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion and showed a close, internal relationship between them. Brain damage following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion was worsened distinctly under diabetic conditions.
