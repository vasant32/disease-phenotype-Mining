The ability of putative neuroprotective compounds to protect against white matter injury remains poorly investigated due to the lack of suitable methods for assessing white matter injury. This study was therefore designed to investigate the utility of Tau 1 (oligodendrocytes/axons), myelin basic protein (MBP; myelin) and amyloid precursor protein (APP; axons) immunohistochemistry in assessing white matter injury at various times following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the rat. Focal cerebral, ischaemia was induced in halothane-anaesthetised rats using an intraluminal thread model. At 24 h, 1 and 2 weeks following MCAO, white matter injury was assessed using Tau 1, APP, MBP and Luxol-fast blue staining and neuronal injury with cresyl fast violet (CFV). In histologically normal tissue MBP immunoreactivity was detected in myelinated fibre tracts, while Tau 1 and APP were axonally located. At 24 h following permanent MCAO, MBP, and Tau 1 staining remained relatively unchanged within the myelin and axonal compartments of the ischaemic region. In contrast, increased Tau 1 staining was apparent in oligodendrocytes within ischaemic tissue, while APP accumulated in axons surrounding the lesion. At 1 and 2 weeks following transient MCAO, Tau 1 and APP staining was markedly decreased within ischaemic tissue. Marked reduction in MBP levels within ischaemic tissue were not detected until 2 weeks following MCAO. The area of axonal injury as assessed by reduced Tau 1 or APP staining correlated with the area of neuronal damage as assessed by CFV staining. This study shows that MBP, Tau 1 and APP immunohistochemistry can be utilised to assess myelin and axonal integrity following sustained ischaemia using standard image analysis techniques.
