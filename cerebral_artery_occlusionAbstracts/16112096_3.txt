INTRODUCTION: To test the hypothesis that matrix metalloprotease-13 (MMP-13) and aggrecan may play roles in post-ischemic neuronal pathophysiology, we examined the impact of middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) on the abundance of these proteins in different regions of the infarct by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blotting (WB). METHODS: The effect of MCAO/R on the abundance of MMP-13 and aggrecan was examined in 23 Wistar rats using antibodies against MMP-13 and aggrecan. BrdU was administered the last 2 days of the experiment. The cellular source of the respective antigens was examined with fluorescent double labeling using the neuronal marker NeuN. Sections were also stained for BrdU. The ischemic zone was defined by MRI on T2-weighted images and also on the tissue sections with the help of H and E counterstain. WB was performed for MMP-13. RESULTS: MMP-13 protein is highly induced in ischemic brain and is associated with neurons, whereas aggrecan is associated with the perineuronal matrix in non-ischemic brain. After 3 days of cerebral ischemia, the number of MMP-13 positive neurons in the periphery of the ischemic lesion increased compared to the respective area in the non-ischemic brain with a peak on day 7. A stronger staining for aggrecan was observed around MMP-13 positive neurons compared with other neurons. The majority of the MMP-13 positive neurons in normal non-ischemic brain were also NeuN positive. BrdU was incorporated into MMP-13 positive neurons in the periphery of the infarct. WB confirmed this results by detecting MMP-13 bands in ischemic brains and activated MMP-13 up to 14 days after ischemia. CONCLUSIONS: There is a close spatial association of MMP-13 and aggrecan around individual neurons. Both MMP-13 and aggrecan appear to be involved in perineuronal matrix remodeling suggesting a role in neuronal reorganization after cerebral ischemia.
