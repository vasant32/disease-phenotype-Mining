Parecoxib is a recently described novel COX-2 inhibitor whose functional significance and neuroprotective mechanisms remain elusive. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate whether delayed administration of parecoxib inhibited mitochondria-mediated neuronal apoptosis induced by ischemic reperfusion injury via phosphorylating Akt and its downstream target protein, glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β). Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered parecoxib (10 or 30 mg kg(-1), IP) or isotonic saline twice a day starting 24 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for three consecutive days. Cerebral infarct volume, apoptotic neuron, caspase-3 immunoreactivity and the protein expression of p-Akt, p-GSK-3β and Cytochrome C in cerebral ischemic cortex were evaluated at 96 h after reperfusion. Parecoxib significantly diminished infarct volume and attenuated neuron apoptosis in a dose-independent manner, compared with MCAO group alone. Increased p-Akt and p-GSK-3β was observed in the ischemic penumbra of parecoxib group after stroke. Moreover, parecoxib also reduced the release of Cytochrome C from mitochondrial into cytosol and attenuated the caspase-3 immunoreactivity in the penumbra. Taken together, these results suggested that parecoxib ameliorated postischemic mitochondria-mediated neuronal apoptosis induced by focal cerebral ischemia in rats and this neuroprotective potential is involved in phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3β.
