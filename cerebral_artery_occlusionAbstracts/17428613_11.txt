Stroke stimulates neurogenesis in the adult rodent brain. The molecules that mediate stroke-induced neurogenesis are not definitely known. Using microarrays containing approximately 400 known genes associated with stem cell and angiogenesis, we compared transcriptional profiles of subventricular zone (SVZ) tissue with cultured neural progenitor cells isolated from the SVZ 7 days after ischemic stroke in the adult mouse. In SVZ tissue, we found that stroke upregulated 58 genes which are involved in multiple signaling pathways during embryonic development, suggesting that stroke recaptures embryonic molecular signals. In neural progenitor cells cultured in growth medium, 23 gene expressions were increased after stroke and 8 of 23 genes overlapped with upregulated genes in stroke SVZ tissue. Expression alterations of selected genes were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. These in vivo and in vitro data provide new insight into the genetic program of adult SVZ neural progenitor cells after stroke and demonstrate gene expression differences between SVZ tissue and cultured SVZ cells.
