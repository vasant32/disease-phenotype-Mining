Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a polypeptide with potent survival-promoting and protective effects on brain cells. In previous studies, we showed that intravenous administration of bFGF reduced infarct volume in models of focal cerebral ischemia in rats, mice, and cats. In these previous studies, infarct volume was measured within 1-7days of the onset of ischemia. The current study was undertaken to determine whether the reduction in infarct volume by bFGF was persistent beyond the first week after stroke. Mature male Sprague-Dawley rats received an intravenous infusion of bFGF (50 microg/kg per h) or vehicle during 0.5-3.5h after permanent proximal middle cerebral artery occlusion. We found a 27% reduction in infarct volume in bFGF- compared to vehicle-treated animals at three months after infarction (P<0.05). The data show that intravenous bFGF treatment produces a persistent reduction in infarct volume, at least up to three months following focal stroke.
