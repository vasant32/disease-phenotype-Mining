An immunoperoxidase technique was used to locate synaptophysin (protein p38), a major integral membrane glycoprotein of synaptic vesicles, in the rat brain. In addition to a diffuse distribution of nerve terminal stainings for synaptophysin appearing as numerous small puncta, the large-sized cells with spindled or polygonal shapes revealed perikaryal staining for synaptophysin in the striatum. The double labeling with immunofluorescence technique disclosed that the cell bodies, immunoreactive for synaptophysin, appeared to be those of the striatal giant cholinergic neurons. In addition, in rats that underwent the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, the striatal ischemic lesions with cell type-specific injury revealed a survival of synaptophysin-positive large cells, presumably identical with the cholinergic neurons. The present study suggests that the metabolism and/or axonal transportation of synaptophysin of the giant cholinergic cells may be different from those of other neuronal populations in the striatum. Also, synaptophysin can act as a neurochemical marker for identification of the giant cholinergic neurons in the striatum of rats.
