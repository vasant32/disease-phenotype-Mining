We report the case of a 55-year-old man who presented with a left hemisphere stroke. The initial computed tomography scan demonstrated a cerebral infarct in association with a left middle cerebral artery occlusion. Carotid duplex ultrasound imaging revealed a surgical grade stenosis of the proximal left internal carotid artery; however, in view of the uncertain benefits of internal carotid endarterectomy in the face of ipsilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion, surgery was deferred. Subsequent surveillance by transcranial Doppler imaging and repeat computed tomography demonstrated spontaneous recanalization. The patient proceeded to carotid endarterectomy with no complications.
