Occlusion of extracranial carotid and vertebral arteries following closed craniocervical trauma is well known. However occlusion of intracranial arteries following closed head injuries is infrequently reported. In fact only 25 cases of post-traumatic middle cerebral artery occlusion have been adequately documented. This entity bears re-emphasis not only because of its rarity but also because of its clinical similarity to other intracranial mass lesions.
