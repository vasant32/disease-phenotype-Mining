 AIM: To investigate the effects of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) transplantation on neuronal apoptosis in the brain after focal cerebral ischemia in rats. METHODS: 72 male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: Sham-operated group , Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group, Vehicle group and ADSC-treated group (n=18). MCAO model was established with the modified Longa's method. One day after right MCAO, 30 μL of cell suspension containing 1×10(6); cells were injected into the lateral ventricle of ADSC-treated group and the same dose of PBS was given to the vehicle group. At 4 d, 7 d and 14 d after MCAO, the apoptosis of neuron was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated DNA nick-end labeling (TUNEL) method and the expression of Bcl-2 and caspase-12 in ischemic region was detected by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. RESULTS: TUNEL-positive cells in ischemic region of ADSC-treated group were less than that in MCAO group and Vehicle group at 4 d, 7 d and 14 d post MCAO (P<0.05). Compared with MCAO group and Vehicle group, the expression of Bcl-2 significantly up-regulated while caspase-12 expression significantly decreased in ADSC-treated group at any time point post MCAO (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The transplantation of ADSCs can reduce neuronal apoptosis of rats with cerebral ischemic injury partly by promoting the expression of Bcl-2 which participates in apoptotic signals after mitochondrial damage and inhibiting the expression of caspase-12 which mediates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis.
