 AIM: To investigate the effects of Angelica sinensis injection on the neuronal metabolites and blood flow speed within reperfusion in the ischemic cerebral injury of rats. METHODS: Sixty-nine male Sprague Dawley rats with an average body weight of 150 to 170 g were used, and were randomly divided into three groups: sham operation group (n = 4), ischemia injury group (n = 30) underwent an operation of ischemic brain injury, Angelica-treated group (n = 35) underwent the same operation and received the treatment of Angelica sinensis injection (5 g/kg bw, i. p). The right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) of both ischemia injury group and Angelica-treated group rats was induced by 5/0 nylon suture for 2 hours. The reperfusion was conducted for three to four hours and five to six hours respectively following MCAO. T2 weighted-imaging (T2WI) and 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) were performed, to study the changes in imaging and neuronal metabolites N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine/phosphocreatine (Cr/ PCr) and choline (Cho) following cerebral ischemia. The changes in blood flow speed were measured by laser Doppler flowmetry. The surface vascular density in right hemisphere were calculated. RESULTS: The hyperintense signals and volume in the right cerebrum in Angelica-treated group decreased compared with those of the ischemia injury group, the T2 values were decreased, and the level of NAA increased, the ratio of Cr/NAA and Cho/NAA decreased. The blood flow speed in Angelica-treated group was improved. The length of brain surface vessels in group C increased. CONCLUSION: The Angelica sinensis injection enhanced the blood circulation in the ischemic brain, improved the neuronal metabolisms.
