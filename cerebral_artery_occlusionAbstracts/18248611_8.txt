Ischemic post-conditioning (Post-cond) is a phenomenon in which intermittent interruptions of blood flow in the early phase of reperfusion can protect organ from ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Recent studies demonstrated ischemic Post-cond reduced infarct size in cerebral I/R injury. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not completely understood. As inflammation is known to be detrimental to the neurological outcome during the acute phase after stroke, we investigated whether ischemic Post-cond played its protective role in preventing post-ischemic inflammation in the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion model. Rats were treated with ischemic Post-cond after 60 min of occlusion (beginning of reperfusion). The infarct volume and myeloperoxidase activity were assessed at 24 h. The lipid peroxidation levels was evaluated by malondialdehyde assay and the expressions of interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 were studied by RT-PCR or western blotting. Ischemic Post-cond decreased myeloperoxidase activity and expressions of interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1. Ischemic Post-cond also reduced infarct volume and lipid peroxidation levels. These findings indicated that ischemic Post-cond may be a promising neuroprotective approach for focal cerebral I/R injury and it is achieved, at least in part, by the inhibition of inflammation.
