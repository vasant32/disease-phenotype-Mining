 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a significant role in cellular physiology. We evaluated the effect of focal ischemia on the expression of 8314 lncRNAs in rat cerebral cortex using microarrays. METHODS: Ischemia was induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Genomic and transcriptomic correlates of the stroke-responsive lncRNAs and the transcription factor binding sties in their promoters were evaluated with bioinformatics. RESULTS: Three hundred fifty-nine lncRNAs were upregulated (>2-fold) and 84 were downregulated (<0.5-fold) at 3 hours to 12 hours of reperfusion after middle cerebral artery occlusion compared with sham. Sixty-two stroke-responsive lncRNAs showed >90% sequence homology with exons of protein-coding genes. Promoters of stroke-responsive lncRNA genes and their homologous protein-coding genes showed highly overlapping transcription factor binding sites. Despite presence of open reading frames, lncRNAs did not form any product when subjected to in vitro translation. CONCLUSIONS: Stroke significantly alters cerebral lncRNA expression profiles.
