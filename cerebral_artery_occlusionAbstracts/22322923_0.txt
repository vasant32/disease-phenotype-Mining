Brain oedema is the volumetric increase of brain tissue and is known to be linked to vascular factors, including the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and vascular permeability. Besides neuroprotection, inhibition of brain oedema also can be a method to protect the brain against ischaemic insult. Sesame is reported to have various beneficial effects on the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems. The neuroprotective effects of defatted sesame seed extract (DSE) in a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAo) rat model were reported previously. The current study was planned to investigate whether the neuroprotective effects of DSE is related to brain oedema. The tMCAo rat model was used to investigate the brain water content (BWC) and Evans blue (EB) leakage. Aquaporin 4 (AQP4), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 expressions at 4 and 24 h after ischaemia were analysed. In vitro zymography was performed to investigate the effects on MMPs activities. DSE (30, 100, and 300 mg/kg, p.o.) reduced BWC but not EB leakage. DSE inhibited AQP4 expression at 4 h but not at 24 h after ischaemia. It did not show any effects on MMPs expressions and activities. Therefore, DSE might be effective on brain oedema by AQP4 regulation during the acute phase of ischaemia.
