PURPOSE: We investigated the contribution of cerebral nitric oxide to neurogenic voiding dysfunction after cerebral infarction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The left mid cerebral artery in female Sprague-Dawley rats was occluded with 4-zero monofilament nylon thread. Bladder activity was monitored during infusion cystometrography. Time or dose dependent effects of intracerebral ventricular administration of the nonselective nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), were investigated in conscious, sham operated and cerebral infarcted rats. The selective neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor 1-(2-trifluoromethylphenyl) imidazole was also administered to determine the participation of nitric oxide synthase subtypes. Cross-sectional infarct area was measured and infarct volume was calculated 12 hours after mid cerebral artery occlusion. RESULTS: Bladder capacity was reduced by 54% 30 minutes after mid cerebral artery occlusion. L-NAME significantly increased bladder capacity in a dose and time dependent manner in cerebral infarcted rats but had no effect on sham operated rats. L-NAME (50 microg./kg.) administered 3 or 5 hours after occlusion significantly increased bladder capacity. This effect of L-NAME was reversed by injecting 250 microg. L-arginine per rat, which alone did not produce any significant change in bladder capacity in cerebral infarcted rats. Administration of 1-(2-trifluoromethylphenyl) imidazole also significantly increased bladder capacity in these rats. On the other hand, 5 microg. of the nitric oxide donor FK-409 per rat reduced bladder capacity for 10 to 15 minutes. None of the drugs affected infarct volume. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that supraspinal nitric oxide has an important role in bladder overactivity after cerebral infarction but it does not affect normal micturition in rats. This finding suggests a central mechanism sensitive to nitric oxide for bladder overactivity after cerebral infarction.
