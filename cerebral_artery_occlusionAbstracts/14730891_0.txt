AIM: To study the effects of 1-(2,6-dimethylphenoxy)-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenylethylamino) propane hydrochloride(DDPH) on brain ischemia injury in rats. METHODS: By using the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) induced by nylon surgical thread inserted through the internal carotid artery into the anterior cerebral artery in rats, the effects of DDPH on neuron defects(ND) and infarct size(IS) were investigated. Using incomplete cerebral ischemia in rats, the effects of DDPH on superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in brain tissue and pathological changes in rats were studied. RESULTS: DDPH at the dose of 10 mg.kg-1 i.p. 30 min before ischemia decreased the ND 3 h after ischemia. The IS declined 24 h after ischemia as well. Meanwhile, DDPH was found to increase SOD activity and reduce the MDA content, as well as mitigate pathological damage, of neuron after brain ischemia in rats. CONCLUSION: DDPH showed protective effects on brain ischemia, probably related to its properties of calcium antagonistic effect and increasing the activity of superoxide dismutases.
