Administration of inhibitors of neuronal nitric oxide synthase or deletion of the encoding gene in rodents provided evidence that neuronal nitric oxide synthase activity may contribute to neuronal cell death following global and focal cerebral ischemia. In the present study, we investigated by in situ hybridization the expression of an endogenous inhibitor of neuronal nitric oxide synthase activity, designated protein inhibitor of neuronal nitric oxide synthase and homologous to cytoplasmic dynein light chain, in the post-ischemic rat brain. Following global ischemia induced by cardiac arrest, messenger RNA expression of protein inhibitor of neuronal nitric oxide synthase was rapidly induced in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampal CA3 region and granule cell of the dentate gyrus which are resistant to ischemic damage. In vulnerable CA1 pyramidal neurons however, protein inhibitor of neuronal nitric oxide synthase expression remained at basal level after global ischemia and was associated with an increase in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase activity and subsequent DNA fragmentation indicating ischemia-mediated neuronal cell death. Following focal cerebral ischemia induced by permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, transcripts of protein inhibitor of neuronal nitric oxide synthase progressively accumulated in cortical neurons bordering the infarct area. After transient middle cerebral artery occlusion however, messenger RNA levels of protein inhibitor of neuronal nitric oxide synthase increased in the reperfused neocortex. Our findings indicate that cerebral ischemia leads to an increase in neuronal expression of protein inhibitor of neuronal nitric oxide synthase in brain regions where sustained or "uncoupled" nitric oxide synthase activity may be detrimental to neurons. Lack of post-ischemic induction of protein inhibitor of neuronal nitric oxide synthase in CA1 pyramidal neurons may result in high nitric oxide synthase activity after global ischemia and could contribute to delayed neuronal cell death.
