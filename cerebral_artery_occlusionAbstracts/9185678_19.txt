The distribution and cell source of macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha) mRNA induced by transient and permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) were investigated by a double in situ hybridization technique. The distribution and time course of the induction of MIP-1alpha mRNA were similar in the two MCAO models. MIP-1alpha mRNA was not detected in the sham-operated rat brain. MIP-1alpha mRNA was induced by MCAO with the peak of expression at 4-6 h after the onset of occlusion, and the signals of MIP-1alpha mRNA were observed in the ischemic core region at an earlier time point, and thereafter intensely in the penumbra of the ischemic area. The signals of MIP-1alpha mRNA were evident on Mac-1alpha mRNA-positive cells, but not on glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) mRNA-positive cells, indicating that MIP-1alpha mRNA was induced in microglia/macrophages of the rat brain after focal cerebral ischemia.
