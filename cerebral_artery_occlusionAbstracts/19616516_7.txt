Morbidity and mortality in stroke are attributed to cerebral edema. To date, six aquaporins (AQPs) have been found in rat brains. Whereas studies have been focused on AQP1, -4 and -9, little is known about the expression of AQP3, -5 and -8. To clarify roles of AQP3, -5 and -8 in water movement, we examined the expression patterns of AQP3, -5 and -8 in ischemic brains from the rats with permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). We also investigated the expression of AQP4 after ischemia, which was used as a positive control. We found that the expression of AQP4 increased continuously until 24 h after pMCAO in both the ischemic core and the border region. The increased expression was correlated with brain swelling, whereas the expression of AQP3, -5 and -8 continued to increase until 24 h after pMCAO in the border region but decreased 6 h after pMCAO in the ischemic core. We also found AQPs were colocalized with GFAP-positive astrocytes and/or NeuN-positive neurons in rat brains. This is the first study describing the expression of AQP3, -5 and -8 in rat brains subjected to pMCAO. Our findings indicated that dynamic changes of AQP3, -4, -5 and -8 expression could contribute to the development of cerebral edema after brain ischemia. Besides, AQP3, -5 and -8 may be involved in the neuronal swelling.
