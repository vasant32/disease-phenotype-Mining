 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the changes of EEG approximate entropy (ApEn) in rats during focal cerebral infarction. METHODS: Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into infarction group (n=12) with middle cerebral artery occlusion and sham-operated group (n=12). The EEG data (ApEn) was recorded in the bilateral areas (C3, C4) of the rats with focal cerebral infarction before the infarction and immediately and at 5, 15, 30, and 60 min after the infarction. The same measurement was carried out in the sham-operated group. RESULTS: In the sham-operated group, ApEn in C3 and C4 showed no obvious differences at the time points (P>0.05), but in the infarction group, ApEn in C3 and C4 increased significantly after the infarction. ApEn in the ischemic area (C4) was significantly lower than that in the non-ischemic area (C3) (P<0.05). The bilateral ApEn decreased with the passage of time. ApEn in the ischemic area (C4) was significantly lowered at 30 min after the infarction in comparison with that before infarction (P<0.05). In the sham-operated group, ApEn showed no significant difference between C3 and C4. ApEn was comparable between the two groups before the operation. CONCLUSION: ApEn can help monitor the occurrence of focal cerebral infarction of rats, and may be used to assess the extent of cerebral ischemia after infarction.
