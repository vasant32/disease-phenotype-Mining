Cerebral ischemic injury is associated with the induction of a series of pro-inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and chemokines. The chemokine-like factor 1(CKLF1), as a novel human cytokine, displays chemotactic activities in a wide spectrum of leukocytes. The present study was conducted to determine if CKLF1 was produced in the brain of rats subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (TMCAO). Therefore, RT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry were utilized to characterize the expression of CKLF1 at different times after TMCAO. The result showed that almost no expression of CKLF1 was found in the sham-operated or contralateral cerebral cortex and hippocampus. CKLF1 expression significantly increased in the ischemic cerebral cortex and hippocampus, elevating at 12 h and peaking at 2 days after reperfusion. CKLF1 positive staining was mainly present in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and hypothalamus. These results demonstrate that the expression of CKLF1 increases after focal cerebral ischemia in rat brain. Thus, CKLF1 may be a potential therapeutic target for cerebral ischemia.
