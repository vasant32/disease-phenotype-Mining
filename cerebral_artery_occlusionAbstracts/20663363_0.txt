Summary: Object. For patients with cerebral embolism, we are using an extracorporeal pump to rev ascularize the more peripheral brain tissues far from the thrombus, proceeding the microcatheter beyond the thrombus, and dissolving the thrombus during a satisfactory time as required. Methods. As the critical cerebral blood flow is thought to be below 30 mlllOOglmin, in the case of middle cerebral artery occlusion at the Ml portion, over 15mllmin. of arterial blood is necessary to protect the brain tissue from irreversible change. One thousand and eight hundred mmHg (about 2 atoms) of pump pressure is necessary to send l5mllmin. of blood through the microcatheter (110 cm, FastTrucker 18, Boston). It was confirmed by laboratory and clinical data that hemolysis of the pump action is not sufficient to aggravate kidney function. Conclusion. This method enables the protection of brain tissues from irreversible change after cerebral embolism, and extends the time sufficiently for thrombolysis.
