We evaluated the role of complement component C5 during the course of cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Systemic C5 inhibition was achieved with an anti-C5 monoclonal antibody, which significantly prevented the deterioration of the motor functions by reducing cerebral lesion and edema. Our results show that activated C5 complement components played an important role in cerebral tissue inflammation resulting from ischemia/reperfusion injury.
