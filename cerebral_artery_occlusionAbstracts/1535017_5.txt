Post-ischaemic changes in forskolin and D1 dopamine receptor (labelled with SCH23390) binding sites were evaluated in a rat unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCA) model. The changes in binding were assessed acutely (2 h post-MCA occlusion) in relation to local cerebral blood flow (lCBF) and chronically (24 h post-MCA occlusion) in relation to histopathological alterations. Two hours following occlusion lCBF was significantly reduced throughout the territory of the MCA. Despite the widespread hypoperfusion, significant reductions in binding were only observed in the dorsolateral caudate nucleus--the region with the most profound reduction in blood flow (6% of the control contralateral lCBF value). Forskolin binding sites were reduced to 40% of the contralateral value while D1 binding sites were reduced to 80% of the contralateral value. Analysis of the relationship between forskolin binding and CBF in the caudate nucleus revealed that the ischaemic threshold for alteration in forskolin binding sites 2 h after MCA occlusion was approximately 34 ml/100 g/min. Twenty-four h post-occlusion forskolin binding sites were further reduced in the dorsolateral caudate nucleus (to 6% of contralateral) while D1 binding showed minimal reduction from that observed at 2 h. The areas of reduced binding corresponded to the area of histopathological change in the caudate nucleus and rostral neocortex. In conclusion, reduction in forskolin binding progresses further than reduction in D1 binding within the first 24 h following focal cerebral ischaemia. For both forskolin and D1 binding sites, the areas of reduced binding 24 h post-MCA occlusion predicted the area of histopathological change.
