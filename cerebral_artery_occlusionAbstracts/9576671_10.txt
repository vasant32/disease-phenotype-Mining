PURPOSE: We review our initial experience with direct percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) as a reperfusion treatment for acute occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. METHODS: Ten patients in whom successful thrombolysis might not be expected because of the risk of hemorrhagic complications or reocclusion were treated with direct PTA. When early ischemic findings were present on the initial CT scans and/or when lenticulostriate arteries were involved, we performed direct PTA rather than thrombolytic therapy. Direct PTA was also performed when superselective local angiography via a Tracker catheter advanced just distal to the occlusion site showed the presence of a large embolus or high-grade stenosis suggestive of thrombosis. Angioplasty was performed with a Stealth balloon catheter with a maximum diameter of 2.0 to 2.5 mm. The balloon catheter was advanced into the site of occlusion and inflated to 2 atm initially, and subsequently up to 3 atm. Two to six inflations, each of 30 seconds' duration, were performed. RESULTS: Although the rate of initial recanalization was 100% (10 of 10), reocclusion occurred in two patients with atherothrombotic M2 occlusion. The final angiographic success rate of direct PTA was 80% (8 of 10). There were no hemorrhagic or technical complications, and five of 10 patients showed marked clinical improvement. In two of seven patients with cardioembolic M1 trunk occlusion, crushed fragments of the embolus obstructed M2 portions after direct PTA, necessitating local thrombolysis. CONCLUSION: Direct PTA may be performed safely as an alternative to thrombolytic therapy in patients with acute occlusion of the middle cerebral artery when early CT findings and/or lenticulostriate artery involvement are present or when superselective local angiography shows the presence of a large embolus or high-grade stenosis.
