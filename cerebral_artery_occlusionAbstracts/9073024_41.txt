We have developed a multiparameter magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cluster analysis model of acute ischemic stroke using T2 relaxation times and the diffusion coefficient of water (ADCw). To test the ability of this model to predict cerebral infarction, male Wistar rats (n = 7) were subjected to 2 h of transient middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion, and diffusion and T2 weighted MRI were performed on these rats before, during and up to 7 days after MCA occlusion. MRI tissue signatures, specified by values of ADCw and T2 were assigned to tissue histopathology. Significant correlations were obtained between MRI signatures at different time points and histopathologic measurements of lesion area obtained at 1 week. In addition, we compared the temporal evolution of MRI tissue signatures to a separate population of animals at which histological data were obtained at select times of reperfusion. A significant shift (p < or = 0.05) within signatures reflecting tissue histopathology was demonstrated as the ischemic lesion evolved over time. Our data suggest, that the MRI signatures are associated with the degree of ischemic cell damage. Thus, the tissue signature model may provide a noninvasive means to monitor the evolution of ischemic cell damage and to predict final outcome of ischemic cell damage.
