Summary: Emergency revascularization of acute carotid artery occlusion is still controversial.We treated 15 patients (13 men and two women, mean age of 67.3 years) with acute atherosclerotic carotid occlusion by endovascular procedures and evaluated the usefulness of this treatment. All of the patients were evaluated with emergency MRI and MRA before treatment. Intracranial tandem arterial occlusion due to distal embolism was observed in nine patients, and contralateral carotid stenosis (> 70%) was observed in seven. The mean NIHSS score of the patients was 15.4 +/- 7.4 (mean +/- SD) before treatment. Treatment modality included local intraarterial fibrinolysis (LIF), percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), and carotid artery stenting (CAS). A protective balloon was successfully placed in the distal carotid artery through the plaque before recanalization in seven patients. Three patients were treated with LIF+PTA, five with PTA+CAS, six with LIF+PTA+CAS, and one with PTA only. Successful recanalization of the carotid artery was obtained in 14 of the 15 patients, and distal tandem middle cerebral artery occlusion was also successfully recanalized in eight of the nine patients. GOS was four or five in eight patients (good outcome group) and 1-3 in seven patients (poor outcome group). Mean NIHSS score of the 15 patients was (6.9 +/- 7.4) after treatment. Preoperative NIHSS score (10.3 +/- 7.4) in the good outcome group was significantly lower than that (21.3 +/- 5.4) in the poor outcome group. The protective balloon technique, PTA with stenting, seems to be useful for acute revascularization of urgent carotid occlusion. Simultaneous treatment of the intracranial tandem occlusive lesion is essential to achieve good clini-cal results. Patients with acute carotid occlusion with NIHSS scores of less than 16 could be good candidates for this advanced treatment.
