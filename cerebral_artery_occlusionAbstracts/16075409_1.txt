We compared cerebral blood flow (CBF) parameters obtained by dynamic susceptibility contrast magnetic resonance imaging (DSC-MRI) with those obtained by flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) in brain regions with different perfusion levels in rats with permanent middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. MCA occlusion was performed in 19 rats. T2-weighted MRI, FAIR and DSC-MRI were performed within 48 h after occlusion. CBF parameters were analyzed in regions of interest with either prolonged or less prolonged mean transit time (MTT). Ratios of ipsi- vs contralateral CBF values were calculated and tested for correlation and differences between FAIR and DSC-MRI. FAIR-aCBF ratios correlated significantly with DSC-rCBF ratios. The mean FAIR-aCBF ratio was significantly lower than mean DSC-rCBF ratio in the area with prolonged MTT. In the area with less prolonged MTT, the mean FAIR-aCBF ratio and mean DSC-rCBF values did not differ significantly. We conclude that FAIR correlates with DSC-MRI if perfusion is preserved. FAIR provides lower CBF values than DSC-MRI if perfusion is reduced and MTT is prolonged. This probable underestimation of perfusion may be caused by transit delays. Care should be taken when quantifying CBF with FAIR and when comparing the results of FAIR- and DSC-MRI in areas with hypoperfusion.
