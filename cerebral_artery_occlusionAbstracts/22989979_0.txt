Modification of the liposomal surface with a targeting molecule is a promising approach for the targeted delivery of therapeutics. Asialo-erythropoietin (AEPO) is a potent tool for targeting an ischemic region by binding to the EPO receptors on neuronal cells. Additionally, it shows a strong cytoprotective effect against programed cell death. Hence, AEPO-modified liposomes appear likely to have both a neuronal-targeting character and a neuroprotective effect on cerebral ischemic injury. In this study, we assessed the targeting ability of AEPO-modified PEGylated liposomes (AEPO-liposomes) to ischemic region and their improvement effect on neurological deficits induced by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (t-MCAO) rats. Immunohistological analysis showed that the AEPO-liposomes given immediately after reperfusion extravasated into the ischemic region and attached strongly to neuronal cells. Also, neuronal nuclei (NeuN) staining was clearly visible only in the AEPO-liposome-treated group, suggesting that AEPO-liposomes protected neuronal cells from ischemia/reperfusion-induced damage. Moreover, a single administration of low-dose AEPO-liposomes significantly improved the neurological deficit compared to vehicle and free-AEPO treatment at 7 days after injection. In conclusion, AEPO-liposomes have clear potential as a neuroprotectant after stroke and as a DDS device targeting ischemic regions.
