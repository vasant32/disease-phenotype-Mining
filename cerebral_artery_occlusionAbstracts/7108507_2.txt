Following right middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat, striatal dopaminergic system alterations were studied. Dopamine turnover was assessed by measuring 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid concentrations and dopamine receptor function, by measuring (3H)-Spiroperidol binding. There was a transient decrease in 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and permanent damage to dopamine receptors, as indicated by a time-dependent progressive reduction in the number of (3H)-Spiroperidol binding sites. The receptor deficit also manifested as turning behaviour towards the lesioned side 4 weeks after the lesion following subcutaneous apomorphine. Long-term changes of dopaminergic receptor activity in this experimental model of cerebral infarction may be secondary to cortical degeneration following middle cerebral artery occlusion.
