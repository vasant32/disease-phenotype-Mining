Angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor blockers (ARBs) are known to prevent the onset of stroke and to attenuate neural damage. Additional beneficial effects of ARBs, independent of AT(1) receptor blockade, have been highlighted. Irbesartan is reported to act as an antagonist of the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) receptor, C-C chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2), due to its molecular structure. We examined the possible synergistic effects of co-administration of irbesartan with propagermanium, a CCR2 antagonist, on ischemic brain damage. Administration of propagermanium decreased ischemic brain area after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). To study the possible synergistic effects of propagermanium with ARBs, we employed non-effective lower doses of irbesartan and losartan. Administration of irbesartan with propagermanium decreased the ischemic brain area more markedly compared with propagermanium alone, but co-administration of losartan did not. MCP-1 mRNA level was significantly increased on the ipsilateral side after MCAO, and administration of irbesartan with propagermanium decreased the MCP-1 level, whereas co-administration of losartan did not. Similar results were obtained for MCP-1 protein level. CCR2 mRNA expression was significantly elevated on the ipsilateral side; however, no significant difference was observed between each group. mRNA levels of other inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β also significantly increased on the ipsilateral side, but the expression levels were not changed by each drug treatment. Taking these findings together, irbesartan exerts more beneficial effects on ischemic brain damage with an MCP-1 receptor blocker, at least due to its inhibitory effects on MCP-1/CCR2 signaling beyond AT(1) receptor blockade.
