AIM: To examine the detailed mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of tetramethylpyrazine (TMPZ) in inflammatory and apoptotic responses induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. METHODS: MCAO-induced focal cerebral ischemia in rats was used in this study. The hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha(HIF-1alpha), activation of caspase-3, and TNF-alpha mRNA transcription in ischemic regions were detected by immunoblotting and RT-PCR, respectively. Anti-oxidative activity was investigated using a thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) test in rat brain homogenate preparations. RESULTS: We showed the statistical results of the infarct areas of solvent- and TMPZ (20 mg/kg)-treated groups at various distances from the frontal pole in MCAO-induced focal cerebral ischemia in rats. Treatment with TMPZ (20 mg/kg) markedly reduced the infarct area in all regions, especially in the third to fifth sections. MCAO-induced focal cerebral ischemia was associated with increases in HIF-1alpha and the activation of caspase-3, as well as TNF-alpha transcription in ischemic regions. These expressions were markedly inhibited by treatment with TMPZ (20 mg/kg). However, TMPZ (0.5-5 mmol/L) did not significantly inhibit TBARS reaction in rat brain homogenates. CONCLUSION: The neuroprotective effect of TMPZ may be mediated at least by a portion of the inhibition of HIF-1alpha and TNF-alpha activations, followed by the inhibition of apoptosis formation (active caspase-3), resulting in a reduction in the infarct volume in ischemia-reperfusion brain injury. Thus, TMPZ treatment may represent an ideal approach to lowering the risk of or improving function in ischemia- reperfusion brain injury-related disorders.
