The efficacy of hemodilution therapy, to ameliorate cerebral ischemia, is limited by an accompanying decrease in oxygen content. We assessed the effect of hemodilution, with diaspirin cross-linked hemoglobin (DCLHb), on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and infarct after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Rats (n = 36) were alloted to a control group in which hematocrit (Hct) was not manipulated, or reduced with DCLHb to 30% (30/DCLHb), 16% (16/DCLHb), or 9% (9/DCLHb). After MCAo, the brain area with a CBF of 0-10 ml.100g-1.min-1 was determined. This area was decreased in the 30/DCLHb and 16/DCLHb groups vs the Control group; and was less in the 9/DCLHb group vs the other groups. Different rats (n = 49) were hemodiluted with DCLHb or Albumin (Alb): Control, 30/Alb, 30/DCLHb, 16/DCLHb, or 9/DCLHb. After 3-hr of MCAo and 2-hr of reperfusion, infarct area was determined. Brain infarct was less in the 30/DCLHb and 16/DCLHb groups vs the Control and 30/Alb groups; and was less in the 9/DCLHb group vs the other groups. The results of this study support the hypothesis that hemodilution with DCLHb decreases cerebral ischemia in a dose-dependent manner, and in terms of brain ischemia is a more proficient hemodiluting fluid than albumin.
