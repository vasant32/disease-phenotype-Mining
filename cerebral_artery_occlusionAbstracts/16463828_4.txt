Previous studies have demonstrated that a brief period of ischemia protect against subsequent severe ischemic insults to the brain, i.e. preconditioning. We evaluated the effects of ischemic preconditioning, produced by 2 min proximal temporary artery occlusion, on brain tissue gases and acidity during clipping of cerebral aneurysm. Twelve patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were recruited. All patients received standard anesthetics. After craniotomy, a calibrated multiparameter catheter was inserted to measure oxygen (PtO2) tension, carbon dioxide (PtCO2) tension and pH (pHt) in tissue at risk of ischemia during temporary artery occlusion. In patients assigned to the preconditioning group, proximal artery was occluded initially for 2 min and was allowed to reperfuse for 30 min. All patients underwent cerebral artery occlusion for clipping of aneurysm. The rate of change in PtO2, PtCO2 and pHt after artery occlusion were compared between groups using unpaired t test. Baseline brain tissue gases and pHt were similar between groups. Following artery occlusion, the decline in PtO2 and pHt were significantly slower in the preconditioning group compared with the routine care group. These results suggested that ischemic preconditioning attenuates tissue hypoxia during subsequent artery occlusion. Brief occlusion of the proximal artery may be a simple maneuver for brain protection during complex cerebrovascular surgery.
