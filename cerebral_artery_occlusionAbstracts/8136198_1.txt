The products resulting from arachidonic acid metabolism of the both cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways possess strong physiological activities, such as vasoconstriction and the enhancement of vascular permeability. Therefore, it is likely that these metabolites are involved in cerebral circulatory disturbance and the formation of brain edema in cerebral ischemia. It is reported that intracerebral injection of leukotriene B4, C4, and E4 increased blood-brain barrier permeability. Thus, it is suggested that leukotrienes may induce vasogenic cerebral edema. We examined role of the products resulting from arachidonic acid of the cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways on the formation of ischemic cerebral edema in rats with focal cerebral ischemia. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by the occlusion of right middle cerebral artery. Acyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (4mg/kg), was given intravenously 30 minutes before the occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Also, azerastine hydrochloride (8mg/kg), which has an inhibitory effect on the production and release of leukotrienes from human neutrophil as well as an antagonistic action on leukotrienes and another inhibitory effect on the production of superoxide anion, was given intravenously 5 minutes prior to occlusion. Concentrations of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), thromboxane B2 (TxB2), 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) and leukotriene C4 (LTC4) measured by radioimmunoassay. The percent water content of a cerebral hemisphere was determined by the wet-dry weight method. In the occluded hemisphere, PGE2, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, TxB2 and LTC4 significantly increased at 2, 6, 12 hours respectively, following the MCA occlusion as compared to the control levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
