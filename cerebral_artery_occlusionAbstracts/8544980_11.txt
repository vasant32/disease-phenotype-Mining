We have developed a stroke model involving middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat which elicits changes in cardiac and autonomic variables that are similar to those observed clinically. It is likely that these neurogenic autonomic responses are mediated by changes in neurotransmitter systems subsequent to the stroke. This possibility was investigated by examining changes in immunohistochemical staining for tyrosine hydroxylase, neuropeptide Y, leu-enkephalin, neurotoxins and dynorphin following middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat. Computerized image analysis was used to provide semi-quantitative measurements of the changes. The ischemic region was centered primarily in the insular cortex. The results indicate that there are significant increases in immunostaining for tyrosine hydroxylase and neuropeptide Y in the insular cortex within the peri-infarct region. Neuropeptide Y staining was also significantly increased in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala, ipsilateral to the middle cerebral artery occlusion, which did not appear to be included in the infarct. Leu-enkephalin, neurotensin and dynorphin staining was significantly elevated in the central nucleus of the amygdala ipsilateral to the occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. These neurochemical changes are discussed as possible mechanisms mediating the cardiac and autonomic consequences of stroke or as part of a process to provide neuro-protection following focal cerebral ischemia.
