We previously demonstrated that the progesterone (PROG) metabolite allopregnanolone (AP) is more potent than PROG in the treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stroke, but the mechanisms for this differential effect are little understood. The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mtPTP) appears to be a key player in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis-induced loss of neurons. Its activation is accompanied by the release of cytochrome c (cyt c) from the intermembrane gap and subsequent cell death. We investigated whether mtPTP is implicated in the mechanisms of PROG and AP neuroprotection following traumatic and ischemic brain injury. To assess the neurosteroids' direct effects on mtPTP activity at the single-channel level, recordings from the inner mitochondrial membrane were obtained by a patch-clamp approach in rat liver mitoplasts. AP but not PROG strongly inhibited mtPTP currents. Interaction of AP with the PTP was further supported by a swelling assay demonstrating that AP inhibited Ca(2+)-triggered swelling in functionally intact rat liver and brain mitochondria. If AP inhibits the mtPTP, it should prevent the mitochondrial cyt c release seen in stroke and TBI. To test this idea, we subjected one group of rats to cortical contusion injury (CCI) and another to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). AP-treated animals showed substantially decreased cyt c release and AP was more potent than PROG in inhibiting mitochondrial cyt c release at 24 h post-CCI and -MCAO. Our results demonstrate that AP inhibits the mtPTP current. This may help to explain its more potent anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective effects compared to PROG.
