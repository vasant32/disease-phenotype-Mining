A case of Neuro-Beh√ßet's disease with the right cerebral artery occlusion on cerebral angiogram was reported. A 63 years old man complained of headache and slight fever without exacerbations of ocular and mucocutaneous lesions, 16 years after he had suffered from recurrent oral aphthous ulcers, genital ulcers, uveitis and erythema nodosum. Laboratory examination demonstrated pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid, a low density area with contrast enhancement in right temporal and parietal lobes in brain CT, a high signal intensity in the same area in T2-weighted image in brain MRI and the occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery on cerebral angiogram. After admission, left homonymous hemianopsia and hemiparesis appeared. With steroid therapy, these symptoms diminished and abnormal findings in brain CT and MRI disappeared, but psychiatric symptoms were exacerbated gradually. Finally he died of agranulocytosis and pneumonia. Neuropathologic findings showed panarteritis of branches of the right middle cerebral artery and infarction of its territories in addition to perivascular infiltrations and foci of demyelination which were prominent in the cerebral basal regions.
