We tested the hypothesis that mild and severe ischemic cell damage are reflected in neurological and functional recovery after stroke. Rats were subjected to either 30 min or 120 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion or sham operation. Neurological and functional tests including, gross neurological score, and rotarod and adhesive removal tests were performed at various time points up to 21 days after stroke. Significant differences between groups of animals were detected using the rotarod and adhesive removal test. A significant correlation between lesion volume and adhesive removal test was detected in rats subjected to 30 min of ischemia. Our data indicate that quantitative rotarod and adhesive removal tests measure different aspects of functional recovery after stroke, and both are useful in characterizing functional recovery from an ischemic insult.
