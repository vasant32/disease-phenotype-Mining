Visual recognition disturbances are caused by lesions that affect visual cortex as well as white matter connections between visual cortex and temporal and parietal cortex. Homonymous visual field defects are often present but do not explain the recognition difficulty. In "alexia without agraphia" (pure alexia), the intact right visual cortex is disconnected from the left parietal language center by a lesion in the splenium. In "prosopagnosia," visual cortex is disconnected bilaterally from temporal cortex. In simultanagnosia, visual association cortex is damaged. The first condition is most commonly caused by left posterior cerebral artery occlusion, the second by bilateral posterior cerebral artery occlusion or head trauma, and the third by watershed infarction, tumors, abscesses, head trauma, leukoencephalopathies and Alzheimer's disease. When such disorders are suspected, the examiner should supplement the routine visual examination with suggested screening maneuvers.
