Behavioral changes in the chronic phase of permanent occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) in rats were investigated. One month after MCA occlusion, 23 rats were unable and 7 rats were able to solve a radial 8-arm maze task during a 1-month period. Three months after occlusion, 19 MCA-occluded rats failed to solve the task successfully again during at least a 1-month period (the cognitively impaired rats), and 11 MCA-occluded rats were able to solve it (the cognitively unimpaired rats). When a delay of 60 min was imposed for this task, five cognitively unimpaired rats failed to solve it. The locomotor activity of the cognitively impaired rats increased significantly 2 months after occlusion, and this increase showed good correlation with spatial cognitive deficit. However, the mean time a rat spent at each arm remained unchanged among the cognitively impaired, unimpaired, and sham-operated rats. There was no significant difference in the ratio between the cognitively impaired and unimpaired rats for disturbed motor coordination. These results suggest that MCA occlusion is capable of producing long-term spatial cognitive disturbance in rats. In addition, this spatial cognitive deficit does not seem to be primarily due to hypermotility or a disturbance in motor coordination.
