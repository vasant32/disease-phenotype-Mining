Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a unique growth factor associated with angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and neuroprotection. The aim of this study was to observe the effects of early intraarterial infusion of low-dose VEGF on ischemia/reperfusion injury after transient focal cerebral ischemia in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 2 h of focal ischemia by middle cerebral artery occlusion. After the 2 h ischemia, the rats were infused with 0.3 microg/kg of VEGF (n = 15), or the vehicle as a control (n = 15), via the reperfused internal carotid artery. The brains were collected after a 1 h, 6 h, or 72 h reperfused period. Severity of ischemic cellular injury, serum extravasation, hemorrhagic transformation, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 expressions were compared between the VEGF-treated and control groups. No significant difference in the extent of ischemic cellular injury and serum extravasation was observed between the two groups. However, vessel numbers with hemorrhagic transformation were significantly greater in the VEGF-treated group than in the control group after the 72 h reperfusion (9.4 +/- 1.6 versus 2.6 +/- 1.5; P = 0.028). The severity of hemorrhagic transformation was not correlated with the extent of ischemic cellular injury or serum extravasation. MMP-2 and -9 expressions were not enhanced in the VEGF-treated group compared with the control group. These results suggest that exogenous VEGF administered intravascularly at a very early point in reperfusion aggravates hemorrhagic transformation. The aggravated hemorrhagic transformation does not seem to depend on the enlargement of ischemic cellular injury, serum extravasation, or overexpressions of MMP-2 and -9.
