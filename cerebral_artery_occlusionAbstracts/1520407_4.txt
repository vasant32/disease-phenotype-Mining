Protein kinase C (PKC) activity was investigated in a model of focal stroke in the rat. Following 6 h of left middle cerebral artery occlusion, rat brains were frozen in situ. In the peripheral ischemic zone, total PKC activity declined by close to two-thirds (1.07 +/- 0.35 vs 2.77 +/- 0.12 nmol/min/mg protein; p less than 0.05, n = 4), and the proportion of total activity associated with the particulate fraction decreased from 33.3 +/- 1.5% to 16.2 +/- 1.4% (p less than 0.01, n = 4). Thus, overall particulate PKC activity in the ischemic zone was less than 20% of control. The cerebral energy metabolite profile of tissue from the ipsilateral hemisphere, corresponding to the region where samples were obtained for PKC activity assay, suggests that this tissue may have been part of the ischemic penumbra before further deterioration.
