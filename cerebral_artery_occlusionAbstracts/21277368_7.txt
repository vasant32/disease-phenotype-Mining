17Î²-estradiol (E) and progesterone (P) are neuroprotective factors in the brain preventing neuronal death under different injury paradigms. Our previous work demonstrates that both steroids compensate neuronal damage and activate distinct neuroprotective strategies such as improving local energy metabolism and abating pro-inflammatory responses. The current study explored steroid hormone-mediated protection from brain damage and restoration of behavioral function after 1h transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Male and ovariectomized female rats were studied 24h after stroke. Both steroid hormones reduced the cortical infarct area in males and females to a similar extent. A maximum effect of ~60-70% reduction of the infarct size was evident after P and a combined treatment with both hormones. No infarct protection was seen in the basal ganglia. Testing of motor and sensory behavioral revealed an equal high degree of functional recovery in all three hormone groups. Gene expression studies in the delineated penumbra revealed that estrogen receptor (ER) alpha and beta are locally up-regulated. tMCAO-mediated induction of the pro-inflammatory chemokines CCL2, CCL5 and interleukin 6 was attenuated by E and P, whereas the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was fortified. Local expression of microglia/macrophage/lymphocyte markers, i.e. Iba1, CD68 and CD3, were significantly reduced in the penumbra after hormone treatment suggesting attenuation of microglia and lymphocyte attraction. These results demonstrate the neuroprotective potency of a combined treatment with E and P under ischemic conditions in both sexes and point at the regulation of chemokine-microglia/lymphocyte interactions as a supposable mechanism implicated in cell protection.
