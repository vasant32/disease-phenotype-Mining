Ischemic stroke stimulates neurogenesis in the adult rodent brain. The molecules that mediate stroke-induced neurogenesis have not been fully investigated. Using a microarray containing 113 known genes associated with angiogenesis, we analyzed transcriptional profiles in subventricular zone (SVZ) tissue and in cultured neural progenitor cells isolated from the SVZ of adult mice subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Among the genes most robustly up-regulated by MCAo were chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10). Consistent with the mRNA data, immunofluorescent staining revealed that MCAo substantially increased the number of CCL2-positive cells in the ipsilateral SVZ and that CCL2-positive cells were positive for both glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and nestin. In vitro studies showed that incubation of neural progenitor cells with recombinant human CCL2 substantially increased the number of Tuj1-positive cells dose dependently compared with the number in the control group, indicating that CCL2 promotes neuronal differentiation. Blockage of CCL2 with a neutralized antibody against CCL2 abolished the effects of CCL2 on neural progenitor cell migration and differentiation. Treatment of neural progenitor cells with CCL2 did not alter the number of BrdU cells and the number of apoptotic cells compared with those in the control group, suggesting that CCL2 does not affect neural progenitor cell proliferation and cell survival. These data demonstrate that in addition to its role in cell motility, CCL2 plays an important role in neuronal differentiation.
