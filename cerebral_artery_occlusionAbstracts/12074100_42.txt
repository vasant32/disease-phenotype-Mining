Melatonin is a potent scavenger of free radicals and an indirect antioxidant. Recent studies have shown that melatonin possesses beneficial effects in experimental models of brain trauma and global cerebral ischemia. The effects of pretreatment with melatonin on volume of cerebral infarction were investigated in the present study. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital to undergo right-sided endovascular middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 3 hr. A single dose of melatonin (1.5, 5, 15, or 50 mg/kg in 1 mL normal saline) or its vehicle was given via an intraperitoneal injection at 0.5 hr before MCAO. Relative infarction volumes on day 3 after MCAO were significantly reduced in the groups treated with melatonin at 5 (mean +/- S.E.M., 15.7 +/- 2.5%) or 15 (21.4 +/- 3.1 %) mg/kg but not at 1.5 (30.6 +/- 3.5%) or 50 (26.7 +/- 2.8%) mg/ kg when compared with the vehicle group (33.9 +/- 3.5%). There was no significant difference in the arterial blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and relative cerebral blood flow among the experimental groups. These results indicate that pretreatment with melatonin at a dose between 5 and 15 mg/kg protects against focal cerebral ischemia.
