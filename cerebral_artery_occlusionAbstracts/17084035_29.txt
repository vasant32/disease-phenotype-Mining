We investigated the molecular mechanisms of the anti-apoptotic properties of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) on neurons and whether G-CSF affects glial cell survival following focal cerebral ischemia in rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a transient 90 min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) by the intraluminal occlusion technique. Rats were treated with either a single dose of G-CSF (50 microg/kg, s.c.) at the onset of reperfusion or G-CSF (50 microg/kg body weight, s.c.) was administered starting at the onset of reperfusion and followed by the administration of the same dose per day for an additional 2 days. Brains were harvested either 24 h, 72 h or 2 weeks after reperfusion for assays of infarct volume, immunohistological studies and Western blot analysis for phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3), Pim-1, bcl-2, Bax, cytochrome c, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2 (cIAP2), and cleaved caspase-3 levels. G-CSF significantly reduced infarct volume and ameliorated the early neurological outcome. G-CSF treatment significantly up-regulated pSTAT3, Pim-1, bcl-2 expression, and down-regulated cytochrome c release to the cytosol, Bax translocation to the mitochondria, and cleaved caspase-3 levels in neurons. The activation of the STAT3 pathway was accompanied by increased cIAP2 expression in glial cells. After MCAO, G-CSF treatment increased both neuronal and glial survival by effecting different anti-apoptotic pathways which reflects the multifactorial actions of this drug. These changes were associated with remarkable improvement in tissue preservation and behavioral outcome.
