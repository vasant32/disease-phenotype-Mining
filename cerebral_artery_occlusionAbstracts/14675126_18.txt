Melatonin, a pineal secretory product synthesized from tryptophan, has been found to be effective against neurotoxicity. The present study was aimed at demonstrating the effectiveness of melatonin in vivo in reducing ischemia-induced cerebral edema using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion/reperfusion surgery. Melatonin was administered twice (6.0 mg/kg, p.o.) just prior to 1 hr of MCA occlusion and 1 day after the surgery. T2-weighted multislice spin-echo images were acquired 1 day after the surgery. In the saline-treated control rats, increases in T2-weighted signals (water content) were clearly observed in the striatum and in the cerebral cortex. In the melatonin-treated group, total volume of edema was reduced by 51.6% compared with control group (P < 0.01). The protective effect of melatonin against edema was more clearly observed in the cerebral cortex (reduced by 59.8%, P < 0.01) than in the striatum (reduced by 34.2%, P < 0.05). Edema volume in a coronal slice was the greatest at the level of the bregma. Suppression of cerebral edema by melatonin was more effective posterior than anterior to the bregma. Melatonin appeared to reduce the volume of the edematous sites rather than to shift the signal intensity distribution. The present MRI study clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of melatonin against cerebral edema formation in ischemic animals in vivo, especially in the cerebral cortex. Melatonin may be highly useful in preventing cortical dysfunctions such as motor, sensory, memory, and psychological impairments associated with ischemic stroke.
