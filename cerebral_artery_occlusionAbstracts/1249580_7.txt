Cortical tissue oxygen measured by a platinum cathode, and cerebral blood flow recorded by a hydrogen clearance technique, were measured in 13 baboons before, during and after temporary occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Mean control pO2 was 23.8 +/- 14 mm Hg and mean flow 51.3 +/- 12 ml/100g/min. During the occlusion, there was a gradation in pO2 from values in the opercular area of 3.6 +/- 5.9 mm Hg, to values in the high parietal area of 11.9 +/- 11.7, these being statistically different (P less than 0.05) from each other. The corresponding flow values were 5.5 +/- 7.5 (opercular) and 22.3 +/- 21.7 ml/100 g/min parietal (P less than 0.01). Following removal of the MCA clip, between 20% and 30% of the electrodes registered an early hyperoxia and hyperaemia, which lasted up to 5 min. A late and prolonged hyperoxia, with less evidence of hyperaemia, was also noted in about 20%. The mean tissue pO2, however, at 5-min intervals up to 40 min following the removal of the clip only reached 60-80% of control values in the most ischaemic areas. Only the parietal region showed a mean pO2 above control levels. The mean flow data were uniformly reduced in all regions to about 80% of control values. During and after a second occlusion in 6 animals, similar changes were noted but with even fewer instances of hyperoxia. The mean oxygen and flow results were lower than with the first occlusion, but the reduction was not significant. There was no overall effect of hypercapnia on cortical tissue pO2 during the control period, but there was a significant (P less than 0.05) reduction during the same procedure after the period of ischaemia. An increase in pO2 during hypercapnia could be observed if there were arousal responses of blood pressure "spikes".
