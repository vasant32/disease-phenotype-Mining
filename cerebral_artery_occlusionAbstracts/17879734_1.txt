OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of allicin on the changes of hemorheology in focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats. METHOD: Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was used to make focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion model by intravascular nylon filament occlusion. The protective effects of allicin at different doses were evaluated by investigating neurological function score, infarction volume and water content of brain. The changes of blood rheology were detected. RESULT: Compared with model group, allicin (15, 25 mg x kg(-1)) increased the neurological function score and decreased the water content and infarction volume of brain in rats. Allicin (15, 25 mg x kg(-1)) inhibited the increasing of the blood viscosity, high shear rate reduced viscosity, high shear relative reduced viscosity and low shear relative reduced viscosity. CONCLUSION: Allicin has protective effects on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injuries. The mechanism may be related to inhibit the increasing of hemorheology.
