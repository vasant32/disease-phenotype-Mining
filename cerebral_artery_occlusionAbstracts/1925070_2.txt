This investigation was designed to study the dynamics of energy-related metabolites (i.e., lactate, pyruvate, inosine, and hypoxanthine) in the extracellular fluid (ECF) of the striatum and in cisternal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during the first 6 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) using microdialysis. Ischemia induced a dramatic increase in the ECF levels of lactate, inosine, and hypoxanthine, while pyruvate did not change significantly. The major part of these changes occurred during the first 10 min after MCAO. Inosine tended to normalize towards the end, while lactate and hypoxanthine remained elevated throughout the experiment. There was no increase of the energy-related metabolites in CSF during the experiment. It was concluded that lactate, inosine, and hypoxanthine appear to be useful ECF markers of the compromised energy state of the brain during ischemia. Because the metabolites did not appear in CSF during the first 6 h after MCAO, such measurements seem not to be useful for early detection of a disturbance in energy metabolism.
