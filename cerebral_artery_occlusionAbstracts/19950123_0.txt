Immediate and certain determination of the treatable area is important for choosing risky treatments such as thrombolysis for brain ischemia, especially in the super-acute phase. Although it has been suggested that the mismatch between regions displaying 'large abnormal perfusion' and 'small abnormal diffusion' indicates a treatable area on an MRI, it has also been reported that the mismatch region is an imperfect approximation of the treatable region named the 'penumbra'. Manganese accumulation reflecting calcium influx into cells was reported previously in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model using activity-induced manganese-enhanced (AIM) MRI. However, in the super-acute phase, there have been no reports about mismatches between areas showing changes to the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and regions that are enhanced in AIM MRI. It is expected that the AIM signal can be enhanced immediately after cerebral ischemia in the necrotic core region due to calcium influx. In this study, a remote embolic rat model, created using titanium-oxide macrospheres, was used to observe necrotic neural responses in the super-acute phase after ischemia. In addition, images were evaluated by comparison between ADC, AIM MRI, and histology. The signal enhancement in AIM MRI was detected at 2 min after the cerebral infarction using a remote embolic method. The enhanced area on the AIM MRI was significantly smaller than that on the ADC map. The tissue degeneration highlighted by histological analysis corresponded more closely to the enhanced area on the AIM MRI than that on the ADC map. Thus, the manganese-enhanced region in brain ischemia might indicate 'necrotic' irreversible tissue that underwent calcium influx.
