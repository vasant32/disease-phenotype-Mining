The powerful vasoconstrictor peptide endothelin-1 (ET1) has been shown to reduce local cerebral blood flow in brain areas supplied by the middle cerebral artery (MCA) to a pathologically low level upon intracerebral injection adjacent to the MCA. This reduction manifests itself as an ischemic infarct, that is fully developed within 3 days after ET1 injection. The aim of the present study is to examine the effect of ET1 on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. ET1 was microinjected unilaterally at a dose of 60 pmol in 3 microl of saline to the MCA in conscious rats. EEG signals were recorded from the frontoparietal cortical area, supplied by MCA, from the first up to the fourteenth day after ET1 injection. EEG activity was analyzed by the fast Fourier transformation. A significant shift to a lower EEG frequency, i.e., augmentation of slow waves and a reduction of alpha-like and faster EEG waves was found post-ET1. This effect was maximal after 3-7 days when the most severe destruction of neurons in this cortical area occurs, as has been previously demonstrated. The results suggest that the quantitative EEG analysis may provide useful additional information about the functional disturbances associated with focal cerebral ischemia.
