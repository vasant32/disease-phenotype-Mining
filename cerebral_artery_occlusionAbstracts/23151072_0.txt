Recent studies suggest that intermittent normobaric hyperoxia (HO) results in ischemic tolerance to reduce ischemic brain injury. In this research, we attempted to see changes the expression of metabotropic glutamate receptors I and II (mGluR I and II) following intermittent hyperoxia preconditioning. Rats were divided into two experimental groups. The first group was exposed to 95% inspired HO for 4 h/day for 6 consecutive days. The second group acted as control, and was exposed to 21% oxygen in the same chamber. Each main group was subdivided to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO-operated) and intact (without any surgery) subgroups. After 48 hours from pretreatment, MCAO-operated subgroups were subjected to 60 min of right MCAO. After 24 hours reperfusion, neurologic deficit score (NDS) and infarct volume (IV) were measured in MCAO-operated subgroups. The expression of mGluR I and II and glutathione levels of core, penumbra and subcortex regions were assessed in sham-operated and intact subgroups. Preconditioning with intermittent HO decreased NDS and IV, increased GSH levels in subcortex, and upregulated mGluRs I and II significantly. Although further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms of ischemic tolerance, the intermittent HO seems to partly exert their effects via upregulation of mGluR I and II.
