An energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence analysis was applied for determining the spatial (two-dimensional) distribution of elemental concentrations in rat brain sections. Freeze-dried brain sections prepared from normal and ischemic rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion were scanned with a collimated X-ray beam (0.18 mm in diameter, 50-kV acceleration voltage). The fluorescent Kalpha X-rays of P, S, Cl, and K were detectable, so that the two-dimensional distribution of fluorescent X-ray intensities could be determined for these elements. Furthermore, quantitative determination was possible for P and K by using the fundamental parameter technique. However, the accurate determination of Na and Ca was difficult, because of the low energy of Kalpha X-ray of Na, and the interference of K-Kbeta with Ca-Kalpha. The change in elemental concentrations in ischemic tissue, including the decrease in K concentration and increase in Cl concentration, was demonstrated by this method as a two-dimensional contour map. Since it is possible to obtain a pictorial representation of the elemental concentration in tissue sections, this method may be useful to evaluate the ionic changes in injured brain tissue in relation to histological or autoradiographical observations.
