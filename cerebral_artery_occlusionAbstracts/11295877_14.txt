Previous work in primary cell culture has shown that TNF-alpha and ceramide are involved in the signaling that induces tolerance to brain ischemia (Ginis et al., 1999; Liu et al., 2000). To validate the in vitro studies, the authors administered cell permeable analogs of ceramides intracisternally or intravenously to examine their effect on neuroprotection after focal cerebral ischemia. Permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was performed in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Infarct volumes were assessed at 24 hours after surgery. D-erythro-N-acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide) or its vehicle was infused intracisternally for 1 hour before MCAO. In a second set of studies, D-erythro-N-octanoylsphingosine (C8-ceramide) or its vehicle was injected intravenously 48 or 24 hours before MCAO to mimic preconditioning (PC) and was also injected 5 minutes after MCAO. C2-ceramide infusion significantly reduced infarct volumes by approximately 14% (P < 0.05). C8-ceramide injection reduced infarct volumes approximately 17% compared with controls. This effect was constant and significant compared with controls over the time periods examined (P < 0.01). This work supports findings in primary brain cell cultures that implicate ceramide as a downstream signal that is proximate to development of tolerance to brain ischemia. Because the degree of protection represents approximately 50% of the maximal infarct reduction observed in this model, there are probably additional signaling pathways that subserve tolerance.
