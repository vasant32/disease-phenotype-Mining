PURPOSE: We evaluated the effect of the adenosine triphosphate dependent K channel opener KRN2391 (N-cyano-N' -(2-nitroxyethyl)-3-pyridinecarboximidamide methanesulfonate) (Kirin Brewery Co., Gunma, Japan) on bladder overactivity induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: At 7 days after implantation of a bladder catheter in male Sprague-Dawley rats a cannula for intracerebroventricular administration was implanted and the left middle cerebral artery was occluded with 4-zero monofilament nylon thread. At 22 hours after the induction of cerebral ischemia saline was infused into the bladder at a constant rate (200 microl. per minute) and a cystometrogram was obtained with the rat in the conscious state. KRN2391 (5 microl.) was administered in intracerebroventricular fashion at graded doses (0.15 to 15 microg.). RESULTS: Bladder capacity in conscious rats was significantly reduced after left middle cerebral artery occlusion. Intracerebroventricular administration of KRN2391 significantly increased bladder capacity in cerebral infarcted but not in sham operated rats. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that a adenosine triphosphate dependent K channel opener may be useful for neurogenic bladder overactivity after cerebral infarction via action on the central nervous system.
