The purpose of this study was to ascertain the relative contribution of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) of the subventricular zone (SVZ) to lineages that repopulate the injured striatum following focal ischemia. We utilized a tamoxifen-inducible Cre/loxP system under control of the nestin promoter, which provides permanent YFP labeling of multipotent nestin(+) SVZ-NSPCs prior to ischemic injury and continued YFP expression in all subsequent progeny following stroke. YFP reporter expression was induced in adult male nestin-CreER(T2):R26R-YFP mice by tamoxifen administration (180 mg kg(-1), daily for 5 days). Fourteen days later, mice were subjected to 60-min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and sacrificed at 2 days, 2 weeks, or 6 weeks post-MCAO for phenotypic fate mapping of YFP(+) cells using lineage-specific markers. Migration of YFP(+) cells from SVZ into the injured striatal parenchyma was apparent at 2 and 6 weeks, but not 2 days, post-MCAO. At 2 weeks post-MCAO, the average percent distribution of YFP(+) cells within the injured striatal parenchyma was as follows: 10% Dcx(+) neuroblasts, 15-20% oligodendrocyte progenitors, 59% GFAP(+) astrocytes, and only rare NeuN(+) postmitotic neurons. A similar phenotypic distribution was observed at 6 weeks, except for an increased average percentage of YFP(+) cells that expressed Dcx(+) (20%) or NeuN (5%). YFP(+) cells did not express endothelial markers, but displayed unique anatomical relationships with striatal vasculature. These results indicate that nestin(+) NSPCs within the SVZ mount a multilineage response to stroke that includes a gliogenic component more predominant than previously appreciated.
