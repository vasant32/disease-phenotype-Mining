K(+) currents of activated glial cells surrounding ischemic infarcts are investigated using acutely dissociated cells from the periinfarct area after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats. Inwardly rectifying K(+) currents (K(IR)) were markedly reduced in cells neighboring infarcts with maximal alteration at day 3 after infarct followed by a partial recovery. This reduction of glial K(IR) currents may contribute to the functional disturbances in the periinfarct area.
