The purpose of this study is to investigate the possible mechanism and the neuroprotective effect of human urinary kallidinogenase (HUK) in cerebral ischemia. The mouse middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was used. Mice were treated with HUK (20 PNAU/g per day, intravenous) or saline as control, from the beginning of reperfusion to 72 h. Neurological deficits, infarct size, and BWC were measured at 6, 24, 48, and 72 h after MCAO, respectively. Pathological changes of brain were observed by TUNEL assay. Inflammatory factors were measured by real-time PCR and western blotting. Activation of MAPKs, Akt, and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) was detected by western blotting. Our results indicated that HUK significantly improved neurofunction, decreased infarct size, and suppressed edema, as well as inflammatory mediators as compared with the vehicle group. Furthermore, HUK inhibited the NF-kappaB pathway and activated the MAPK/ERK pathway in this neuroprotection.
