Schizencephaly is a brain-destructive lesion relating to clefts in the fetal brain that usually communicate with the ventricular system, subarachnoid space, or both. It presents as two types: Type I (closed) and Type II (open). During pregnancy, it may be suspected in the course of ultrasonography, which highlights ventricular dilatation and brain abnormalities. Usually, the diagnosis is confirmed postnatally using trans-fontanel ultrasonography. The etiology of schizencephaly is still unknown, but it may be derived from a primary disorder of brain development or from bilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion. Many causative agents including vascular insult, infections, toxins, and medications have been associated with this malformation. We present a pictorial essay of six cases of schizencephaly that were suspected on prenatal ultrasound scans and confirmed postnatally by trans-fontanel, two-dimensional and three-dimensional ultrasonography.
