Formation of the lipid peroxidation product 8-epi-prostaglandin2alpha (8-epi-PGF2alpha) a bioactive marker of oxidative stress, was quantified in in vitro and in vivo models of neuronal death. In culture media of primary rat cortical neurones exposed to hypoxia followed by reoxygenation, a 3.7-fold increase of 8-epi-PGF2alpha concentration was observed in comparison to control cells. In rats submitted to 2h middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by a 22h reperfusion period, a 27-fold increase of 8-epi-PGF2alpha was observed in the ischaemic hemisphere compared with the corresponding hemisphere of sham-operated rats. Treatment with the neuroprotective agent BN 80933 significantly reduced both 8-epi-PGF2alpha elevations in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that 8-epi-PGF2alpha elevations might reflect the damaging free radical overproduction and subsequent lipid peroxidation during neuronal injury induced by hypoxia and ischaemia. Inhibition of 8-epi-PGF2alpha elevations participates to the neuroprotective effects of BN 80933.
