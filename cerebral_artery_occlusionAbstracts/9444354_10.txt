Six cases of middle cerebral artery occlusion are presented in which the cellular changes accompanying descending degeneration of the lateral corticospinal tract were studied at different time points (5 days-10 years) following the insult. Microglia and perivascular cells were found to ingest large amounts of myelin degradation products, while expressing high levels of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. Activation of perivascular macrophages, as indicated by increased class II expression, lasted for many years and appeared to follow down-regulation of both phagocytic activity and class II expression on parenchymal microglia. TUNEL labeling was absent from both microglia and perivascular cells at all time points investigated. Indirect evidence is presented that microglia may transfer myelin degradation products to the perivascular space. Perivascular cells which express MHC class II molecules constitutively do not appear to leave the perivascular compartment in large numbers and could release myelin degradation products into the cerebrospinal fluid. The possible immunological consequences of these findings are discussed with respect to their possible relevance for antigen presentation and autoimmune central nervous system disease.
