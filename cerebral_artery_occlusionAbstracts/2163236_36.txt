Pharmacological inhibition of cell excitation during focal ischemia was studied in the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion model. The potent and selective N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist CGS 19755, administered 5 minutes prior to or 5 minutes following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion, caused a substantial decrease in infarct size, which was associated with reduction of postischemic cerebral glucose hypermetabolism. These data support a role for excitation-induced hypermetabolism in the pathogenesis of infarction following focal cerebrovascular occlusion.
