This study examined the effect of glycine recognition site antagonism (ACEA 1021) on the incidence of spontaneous depolarizations in the penumbra of a focal ischemic lesion. Rats were administered either vehicle (n = 7), ACEA 1021 (n = 7) or dizocilpine (n = 5) and then underwent 90 min middle cerebral artery occlusion. The cortical direct current (DC) potential was recorded. During ischemia, 7 +/- 3 DC shifts occurred in the vehicle group. ACEA 1021 did not reduce this frequency (7 +/- 2 DC shifts) although dizocilpine did (1 +/- 1 DC shifts; p = 0.02). The previously demonstrated neuroprotective property of ACEA 1021 during focal cerebral ischemia cannot be attributed to reduction of spontaneous depolarization in the ischemic penumbra.
