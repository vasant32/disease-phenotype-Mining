 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the protective effects of Ginkgolide B on inflammation induced by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in rats. METHODS: Rats were pretreated with Ginkgolide B at the dose of 2. 5, 5, 10 mg/kg for 3 days and then subjected to cerebral ischemia/reperfusion induced by a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The infarct volume and the neurological deficit were determined by the method of TTC (2,3,5-triphenylterazolium chloride) staining and Longa's score. The permeability of blood-brain barrier (BBB) was evaluated by measurement of the evans blue (EB) content in the brain with spectrophotometer. The content of interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6 (IL-6, IL-1beta) in serum and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), The content of E-selectin and ICAM 1 in brain were determined by radio-immunoassay and ELISA assay. RESULTS: Ginkgolide B reduced infarct volume, ameliorated the neurological deficit and the permeability of BBB, the content of IL-6, IL-1beta in serum and TNF-alpha, expressions of E-selectin and ICAM 1 in brain tissue also were significantly decreased. CONCLUSION: Ginkgolide B has protective effects on cerebral injury by inhibiting the inflammation induced by ischemia/reperfusion injury.
