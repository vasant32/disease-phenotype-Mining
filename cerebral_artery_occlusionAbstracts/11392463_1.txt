Leukocytes play a key role in ischemia-reperfusion-induced tissue injuries. It has been suggested that blocking the Na+/H+ exchanger improves ischemic injuries such as stroke. In this study, we investigated the effect of the Na+/H+ exchanger inhibitor SM-20220 (N-[aminoiminomethyl]- 1-methyl-1H-indole-2-carboxamide methanesulfonate) on leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions during ischemia-reperfusion. SM-20220 (0.3-1.0 mg/kg i.v.) given after ischemia significantly attenuated the leukocyte adhesion in the mesenteric postcapillary venules that was induced by transient superior mesenteric artery occlusion. At 60 min after reperfusion, the numbers of adherent leukocytes in groups treated with vehicle or SM-20220 (0.3 mg/kg) were 15.1+/-2.9 cells/100 microm/3 min and 3.0+/-0.7 cells/100 microm/3 min (p < 0.01), respectively. In a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model, i.v. infusion of SM-20220 (0.4 mg/kg per hour) for 1 h, beginning 1 h after the start of occlusion, significantly reduced both the infarct size and the increase in brain myeloperoxidase activity, compared with the vehicle group (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). In summary, this is the first evidence that the leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium that is induced by ischemia-reperfusion is attenuated by the inhibition of Na+/H+ exchanger activity in vivo. Our results suggest that Na+/H+ exchanger inhibitors may prevent ischemia-reperfusion injuries such as stroke partly through the attenuation of leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions.
