We previously reported that propofol (20 mg/kg/h) post-conditioning provided acute (up to 24 h) neuroprotection in rats with transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. In this study, we extend these data by examining long-term protection and exploring underlying mechanisms involving AMPA receptor GluR2 subunit internalization. Rats were treated with propofol 20 mg/kg/h after 60 min of occlusion (beginning of reperfusion for 4 h). Propofol post-conditioning reduced infarct volume and improved spatial memory deficiencies (up to 28 days) induced by ischemia/reperfusion injury. Additionally, Propofol post-conditioning promoted neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of hippocampus, as measured by bromodeoxyuridine and neuron-specific nuclear protein immunofluorescence-double staining at day 28 after reperfusion. Finally, propofol post-conditioning increased the surface expression of AMPA receptor GluR2 subunit, thus inhibited the internalization of this part until 28 days after stroke. In conclusion, our data suggest that propofol post-conditioning provides long-term protection against focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats. Furthermore, we found that the inhibition of AMPA receptor GluR2 subunit internalization may contributed to this long-term neuroprotection.
