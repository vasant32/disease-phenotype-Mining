Previous studies have found that rats subjected to 15-min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) show neurodegeneration in the dorsolateral striatum only, and the resulting striatal lesion is associated with increased T1-weighted (T1W) signal intensity (SI) and decreased T2-weighted (T2W) SI at 2-8 weeks after the initial ischemia. It has been shown that the delayed increase in T1W SI in the ischemic region is associated with deposition of paramagnetic manganese ions. However, it has been suggested that other mechanisms, such as tissue calcification and lipid accumulation, also contribute to the relaxation time changes. To clarify this issue, we measured changes in relaxation times, lipid accumulation, and elemental distributions in the brain of rats subjected to 15-min MCAO using MRI, in vivo 1H MR spectroscopy (MRS), and synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (SRXRF). The results show that a delayed (2 weeks after ischemia) increase in T1W SI in the ischemic striatum is associated with significant increases in manganese, calcium, and iron, but without evident accumulation of MRS-visible lipids or hydroxyapatite precipitation. It was also found that 15-min MCAO results in acutely reduced N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) ratio in the ipsilateral striatum, which recovers to the control level at 2 weeks after ischemia.
