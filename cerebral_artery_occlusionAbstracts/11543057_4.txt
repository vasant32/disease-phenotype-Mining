OBJECTIVE: To validate near-infrared cerebral topography (NCT) as a practical tool in tracing the regional hemodynamic changes during normal ischemic stroke model of rat. METHOD: Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and photosensitizer induced intracranial infarction model of rat were established. The geometric shape and infarction area were measured by NCT, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and TTC stained anatomical imaging techniques. RESULT: In photosensitizer induced infarction model, the correlation between anatomical infarct area and NCT image area for infarct focus were r = 0.897 for 24 h group (P < 0.05) and r = 0.906 for 2 months group (P < 0.01), respectively. The correlation between anatomical infarction area and NCT image area for infarct focus were r = 0.820 for normothermia group (P < 0.05) and r = 0.851 for hypothermia group (P < 0.05), respectively. The correlation between fMRI and NCT image area for infarction focus were r = 0.874 for normothermia group (P < 0.05) and r = 0.782 for hypothermia group (P < 0. 05), respectively. CONCLUSION: Measurement with NCT for infarction focus matched well with fMRI and anatomic sample in rats. NCT technique might be a practical tool for short-term prediction of stroke and the rehabilitation after stroke in real time.
