The possible ability of nicotinamide and ketamine to decrease infarction volume and DNA fragmentation was investigated in a middle cerebral artery occlusion rat model. DNA fragmentation was measured with an enzyme linked immunoassay. Control infarct volume was 223.8 +/- 10.6 mm(3). Ketamine alone did not alter infarct volume, 233.2 +/- 61.8 mm(3). Nicotinamide alone did not alter infarct volume, 235.2 +/- 62.8 mm(3). The combination of ketamine and nicotinamide decreased infarct volume to 83.8 +/- 35.2 mm(3). Ketamine produced hypothermia. Nicotinamide and ketamine decreased brain swelling and DNA fragmentation in the cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus in rats perfused for 6 or 24 h. Ketamine may synergize the actions of nicotinamide and partially prevent brain damage from ischemia and reperfusion.
