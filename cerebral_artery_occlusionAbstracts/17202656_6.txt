The preventive effect of Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bunge (Liliaceae), a traditional Chinese medicine, on ischemia-reperfusion-induced brain injury was evaluated in the rat brain. Ischemia was induced by intraluminal occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery for 2 h and reperfusion was continued for 22 h. Water extract of Anemarrhena asphodeloides (WEAA) was orally administered promptly prior to and 2 h after reperfusion. Total infarct volume and edema in the ipsilateral hemispheres of ischemia-reperfusion rats were significantly reduced by treatment with WEAA in a dose-dependent manner (p<0.05). The therapeutic time window of WEAA was 3 h in this ischemia-reperfusion rat model. WEAA also significantly inhibited increased neutrophil infiltration of ischemic brain tissue as estimated by myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and immunohistochemical analysis. MPO-positive cells were markedly reduced by WEAA administration in striatal and cortical areas. These findings suggest that WEAA plays a crucial protective role in ischemia-induced brain injury, and suggest that WEAA could serve as a lead medicinal herb for the development of neuroprotective agents following transient focal ischemic brain injury.
