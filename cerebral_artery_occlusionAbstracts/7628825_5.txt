We have studied the effects of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in rats on polyamine efflux in the parietal cortex using the microdialysis technique. Dialysis probe implantation itself provoked a delayed, prolonged and vigorous release of spermidine and putrescine. Spermidine release returned to stable baseline levels within 48 hours. Putrescine release also returned to lower levels within this time period but putrescine levels in the dialysate fluctuated dramatically in individual animals. Because of the underlying effects of the dialysis probe (likely a reflection of traumatic cerebral damage and stimulation of polyamine metabolism and release within the immediate vicinity of the dialysis probe), MCA occlusion was performed 48 hours after probe implantation. MCA occlusion persistently (5/5 animals) resulted in a significant increase in cortical spermidine efflux, although the onset, magnitude and duration of this increased release was variable. Putrescine efflux was significantly increased in 2/5 animals with MCA occlusion but the increase in release was similar to the spontaneous fluctuations observed in control animals. Spermine was not detectable in cortical dialysates of control or MCA occluded groups. Spermidine, but not spermine or putrescine is consistently released from the parietal cortex following permanent focal ischaemia and may contribute to ischaemic neuropathology either through its effects at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor or via direct, and as yet uncharacterised, neurotoxic effects.
