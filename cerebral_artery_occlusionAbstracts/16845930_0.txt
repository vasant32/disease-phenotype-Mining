The ability of afobazole, a selective anxiolytic to prevent the brain local ischemia-induced anxiety has been studied in experiments on rats. It is established that middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) is accompanied by the development of anxiety, the degree of which increases with the duration of occlusion. Afobazole in a doze of 1 mg/kg administrated during 6 days after MCAO prevents the development of anxiety. The effect is manifested by positive changes in the parameters describing the behavior of animals in elevated plus maze test. No tolerance to the drug is developed during continuous afobazole injection within 12 days after MCAO. The experimental data indicate that the well-known anxiolytic action of afobazole is also well pronounced under the conditions of a local cerebrtal ischemia.
