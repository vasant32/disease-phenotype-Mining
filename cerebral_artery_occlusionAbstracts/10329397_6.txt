We investigated the distribution of glutaredoxin (GRX, thioltransferase) in the rat brain using the in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical methods. GRX mRNA and GRX were expressed widely in the rat brain. The endothelial cell, tanycyte and ependymal cell expressed GRX mRNA and GRX protein. Neurons in various regions also showed GRX mRNA and GRX. Among them, pyramidal neurons in hippocampal CA3 region expressed a higher level of GRX mRNA. In addition, GRX mRNA signals were reduced after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Immunohistochemical analysis for GRX also revealed that GRX was reduced after ischemia. Northern blot analysis also showed that GRX mRNA from ischemic hemispheres decreased after ischemia. This reduction was parallel with the neuronal damage. This observation indicated that the maintenance of GRX and the redox regulating system was important for neuronal survival against oxidative stress.
