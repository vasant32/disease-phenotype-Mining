 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with stroke unsuitable for IV thrombolysis may be considered for endovascular revascularization, particularly when baseline imaging suggests proximal cerebral vessel occlusion associated with minimal established infarction. This retrospective review describes the use of a self-expanding retrievable intracranial stent (Solitaire AB) for thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-six consecutive patients with stroke treated endovascularly by using the Solitaire stent were identified, followed by detailed review of data extracted from their imaging and clinical records. RESULTS: Recanalization (TIMI grade ≥2) was achieved with Solitaire thrombectomy as the single treatment technique in 16 patients and in combination with urokinase or the Penumbra device in 9 of the remaining 10 patients. Two patients had symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. A favorable clinical outcome (mRS score of ≤2) was seen in 3 of 5 patients with MCA occlusion, 6 of 11 (55%) patients with ICA occlusion, and 2 of 10 patients with BA occlusion. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical thrombectomy by using the Solitaire stent appears to be safe and is capable of achieving a high rate of recanalization and favorable clinical outcomes in patients presenting with proximal cerebral vessel occlusion.
