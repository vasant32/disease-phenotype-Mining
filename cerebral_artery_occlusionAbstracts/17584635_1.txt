OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of ligustrazine on cell proliferation in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and dentate gyrus (DG) and nNOS expression in rat brain after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. METHODS: Male SD rats were randomly divided into normal control group, sham operation group, model group and ligustrazine treatment group. The latter two groups were further divided into 5 subgroups for observation at 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21 days after reperfusion following a 2-hour middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The cells in S phase were labeled with BrdU, and immunohistochemistry was employed to detect BrdU- and nNOS-positive cells. The numbers of BrdU-positive cells in the SVZ and DG were measured. The expression of nNOS was detected by Western blotting. RESULTS: nNOS expression increased significantly in the model group as compared to the sham operation group (P<0.05), and ligustrazine treatment significantly lowered the expression level in comparison with the model group (P<0.05). Compared with the model group, a significant increase in BrdU-positive cells occurred in the SVZ of rats 1 and 3 days after igustrazine treatment (P<0.05), along with an increase of DG BrdU-positive cells. CONCLUSION: Ligustrazine significantly restrains ischemia-reperfusion injury-induced nNOS activity enhancement and promotes cell proliferation in the SVZ and DG of adult rats after ischemia-reperfusion injury.
