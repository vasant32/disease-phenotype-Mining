Extract of danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge.) has been clinically prescribed in China to treat patients with stroke. The novel compound designated ND-309, namely isopropyl-beta-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-alpha-hydroxypropanoate is a new metabolite of danshen in rat brain. The present study was conducted to investigate whether ND-309 has a protective effect on brain injury after focal cerebral ischemia, and to determine the possible mechanism. Adult male SD rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) by bipolar electro-coagulation. Behavioral tests were used to evaluate the damage to central nervous system. The cerebral infarct volume and edema were assessed to evaluate the brain patho-physiological changes. Spectrophotometric or spectrofluorometric assay methods were used to determine the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione-peroxidase (GSH-Px), contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), as well as respiratory control ratio of the brain mitochondria. The results showed that treatment with ND-309 significantly decreased neurological deficit scores, reduced infarct volume and the edema compared with the model group. Meanwhile, ND-309 significantly increased the brain ATP content, improved mitochondrial energy metabolism, attenuated the elevation of MDA content, the decrease in SOD, GSH-Px activity and the generation of ROS in brain mitochondria. All of these findings indicate that ND-309 has the protective potential against cerebral ischemia injury and its protective effects may be due to the amelioration of cerebral energy metabolism and its antioxidant property.
