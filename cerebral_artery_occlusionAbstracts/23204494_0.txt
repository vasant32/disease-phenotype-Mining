 UNLABELLED: This study aimed to assess whether (18)F-FDG PET could serially monitor the beneficial effects of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) on cerebral glucose metabolism when transplanted into the infarct brain of rats. METHODS: The BMSC from green fluorescent protein transgenic rats or vehicle was stereotactically transplanted into the ipsilateral striatum at 7 d after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion of rats. Local glucose metabolism was semiquantitatively measured at 6 and 35 d after ischemia using (18)F-FDG PET. Motor function was serially evaluated throughout the experiments. At 35 d after ischemia, immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the phenotype of BMSC and their effects on the expression of brain-type glucose transporters. RESULTS: BMSC transplantation not only enhanced functional recovery but also promoted the recovery of glucose utilization in the periinfarct area when stereotactically transplanted at 1 wk after ischemia. The engrafted cells were widely distributed, and most expressed a neuron-specific protein, NeuN. BMSC transplantation also prevented the pathologic upregulation of glucose transporters in the periinfarct neocortex. CONCLUSION: The present findings strongly suggest that the BMSC may enhance functional recovery by promoting the recovery of local glucose metabolism in the periinfarct area when directly transplanted into the infarct brain at clinically relevant timing. The BMSC also inhibit the pathologic upregulation of brain-isoform glucose transporters type 1 and 3. (18)F-FDG PET may be a valuable modality to scientifically prove the beneficial effects of BMSC transplantation on the host brain in clinical situations.
