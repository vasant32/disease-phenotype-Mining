The purpose of this study was to ascertain if the signal intensity ratio and the lesion area determined by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging during brief focal ischemia and early reperfusion predict outcome determined by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and T2-magnetic resonance imaging at 24 h. Seventeen rats were imaged before and during 30 min of endovascular middle cerebral artery occlusion and at 15 min, and 23.5 h after the onset of reperfusion. Both hemisphere and basal ganglia signal intensity ratio increased significantly from baseline during ischemia, decreased significantly from ischemic levels during early reperfusion, and increased again at 24 h. However, signal intensity ratio during ischemia or after 45 min of reperfusion did not correlate statistically with diffusion-weighted-signal intensity ratio at 24 h. Both hemisphere signal intensity ratio and basal ganglia signal intensity ratio at 15 min of reperfusion correlated, but only moderately, with diffusion-weighted-signal intensity ratio at 24 h (r = 0.52, p < or = 0.05). Although lesion areas during ischemia were comparable to those observed at 24 h, lesion areas at both 15 and 45 min of reperfusion were significantly smaller than those observed during ischemia and at 24 hr. Thus, sequential imagining demonstrated partial resolution and delayed recurrence of magnetic resonance-defined ischemic lesions during reperfusion after brief focal ischemia.
