Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to assess the effect of an astrocytic Na+2Cl-K+ cotransporter inhibitor, a novel torasemide derivative, on the time course and spatial evolution of a focal cerebral ischemia in the rat. The drug (1 mg/ kg, i.p.) was injected 30 min before middle cerebral artery occlusion and diffusion-weighted images were acquired at various times thereafter. The results showed that the drug reduced the size of the hyperintensity during the first hours, but did not affect the time constant of growth or the final size. The temporary reduction of the cytotoxic oedema induced by the torasemide derivative, demonstrates an antioedematous activity.
