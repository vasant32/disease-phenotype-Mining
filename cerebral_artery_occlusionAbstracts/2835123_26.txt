Seven days after unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats, peripheral type benzodiazepine binding sites (PTBBS), using [3H]PK 11195 as a specific radioligand, were greatly increased in the cortical and striatal regions surrounding the focus of infarction with smaller increases in the ventrolateral and posterior thalamic complexes and in the substantia nigra, all ipsilateral to the occlusion. Similarly, PTBBS increases were observed in the caudate nucleus and entorhinal cortex of cats likewise subjected to prior unilateral occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Intrastriatal administration of N-methyl-D-aspartate (250 nmol) in the rat resulted in a dramatic ipsilateral increase in PTBBS levels in the striatum and in the deeper laminae of the ipsilateral frontoparietal cortex. Intrastriatal kainic acid administration (12 nmol) also elicited PTBBS increases ipsilaterally in rat striatum and cortex; a bilateral elevation of PTBBS levels was observed in the hippocampus. With all these interventions there existed a good spatial correlation between the PTBBS increase and neuronal loss as assessed either histologically or by the autoradiographic detection of the putative neuronal marker [3H]SCH 23390 (a D1 dopamine receptor ligand). Moreover, a glial proliferation of non-neuronal cells (macrophage and glial cells) was observed in brain regions noted to have increased PTBBS levels. PTBBS autoradiography thus constitutes a suitable technique for the localization of damaged areas in several experimental models of brain injury. PTBBS label not only the primary lesions but also functionally related areas and could further our understanding of phenomena such as partial neuronal loss and diaschisis. The study of PTBBS could be envisaged for the detection, localization and quantification of all neuropathological situations which engender a glial reaction or macrophage invasion and is potentially applicable to both experimental and human subjects, in which both autoradiographic and tomographic approaches could be undertaken.
