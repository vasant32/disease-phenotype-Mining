Ginkgolide K, a natural platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist, was isolated from the leaves of Ginkgo biloba. However, little is known about its neuroprotective effect in ischemia-reperfusion (I/R)-induced cerebral injury. Hence, the present study was carried out to investigate the effect of ginkgolide K on neuroprotection and the potential mechanisms in the rat I/R model induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The rats were pretreated with ginkgolide K 2, 4 and 8 mg/kg (i.v.) once a day for 5 days before MCAO. Neurological deficit score (NDS), brain water content, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and pathology of brain tissue, as well as indexes of oxidative stress [superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS)] were measured at 24 h after ischemia. The results indicated that pretreatment with ginkgolide K significantly diminished the volume of infarction and brain water content, and improved NDS. Moreover, ginkgolide K markedly reversed the level of MDA, NO, NOS and SOD to their normal state in serum or cerebral ischemic section. In addition, hematoxylin and eosin staining showed the neuronal injury was significantly improved after being pretreated with ginkgolide K. These findings demonstrate that ginkgolide K exhibits neuroprotective properties through its antioxidative action in MCAO rats.
