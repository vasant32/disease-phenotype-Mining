OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of Ligustrazine on cells proliferation in cortex and striatum after focal cerebral ischemia in adult rats. METHODS: Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by left middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with suture method. Two hours later, injection of Ligustrazine (80 mg/kg, 1 time/d) was performed peritoneally. Four hours after the ischemia, 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) (50 mg/kg, 1 time/d) was injected peritoneally. At 7d, 14d and 21d after ischemia, BrdU-Labeled cells in the cortex and striatum were observed by immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: In ischemia model group, at 7 day, BrdU-labeled cells were observed in the ipsilateral cortex and striatum. With the prolongation of ischemia, the number of BrdU-labeled cells increased, reached the peak at 21d. In Ligustrazine group, BrdU-labeded cells were observed with an intense distribution in ischemic penumbra of the cortex and striatum. With the prolongation of ischemia, the number of BrdU-labeled cells increased significantly at 14d, and reached the peak at 21d. The numbers of BrdU-labeled cells at 7d, 14d and 21d were more than those in ischemia model group respectively. CONCLUSION: Ligustrazine increase the proliferated cells in the cortex and striatum after focal cerebral ischemia in adult rats. The results suggest that it may be useful for promoting self-repair after ischemia.
