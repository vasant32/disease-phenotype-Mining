We have shown that hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) reduced cerebral infarction in rat middle cerebral artery occlusion model (MCAO). The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of HBO on ischemic striatal metabolites at different times after MCAO and reperfusion. A rat MCAO model was produced via the intraluminal filament method. After 2 h of occlusion the suture was removed and reperfusion was allowed. The rats were sacrificed at 24 h after reperfusion. HBO treatment was administered by putting rats in the HBO chamber at 3 atmospheres absolute (ATA) HBO for 1 h. Glucose, lactate, pyruvate, and glutamate in striatal extracellular fluid were collected and measured by a microdialysis system at 7, 10, and 24 h after reperfusion. Glucose, pyruvate and glutamate concentrations were increased after reperfusion. HBO treatment decreased glucose, pyruvate, and glutamate almost to the control level (preocclusion level). The lactate concentration remained unchanged after ischemic/reperfusion and after HBO treatment. This study suggested that altered brain energy metabolites and excitatory amino acids occurred during cerebral ischemia and and HBO regulated these striatal metabolites, which might contribute to the protective effect of HBO in cerebral ischemia.
