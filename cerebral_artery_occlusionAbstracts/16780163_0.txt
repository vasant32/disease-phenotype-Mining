OBJECTIVE: To research the protective effect of pueraria flavonoid on the cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury. METHOD: Using the middle cerebral artery occlusion model (MCAO) in rats, we investigated the influence of pueraria flavonoid on the brain water content, the infarct volume, the activities of SOD, and the content of MDA. RESULT: Pueraria Flavonoid could obviously reduce the brain water content and the infract volume in MCAO, increase the activities of SOD, and decrease the content of MDA in the cerebral ischemia- reinfusion model of rats. CONCLUSION: Pueraria has the function of scavenging free radicals and the protective effect on ischemic brain tissue.
