This study examines the effect of Propentofylline (PPF) on reactive microglia in the lumbar spinal cord in rats following focal cerebral ischaemia produced by permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Our results showed that daily treatment of PPF beginning at 24 h after MCA occlusion for 2 or 4 consecutive days markedly suppressed the microglial response as detected immunohistochemically with OX-42. The most dramatic effect was the prevention of transformation of ramified microglia into amoeboidic form as well as formation of perineuronal microglia in close association with the soma of motoneurons. This has greatly amplified the potentiality of PPF used as a neuroprotective drug against microglia-related neuron damage induced by cerebral ischaemia.
