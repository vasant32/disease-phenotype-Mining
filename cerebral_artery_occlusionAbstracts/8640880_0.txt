Vascular disease and focal cerebral ischemia still represent the major cause of neurological morbidity and mortality. Mechanisms of hypoxic changes are associated with energy depletion and impairment of biological membranes. Reperfusion after the stroke plays an important role in the development of morphological and functional changes of the nervous tissue. In experiments, different models of focal cerebral ischemia based on the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) are used. Four main categories of such models are most frequently employed: 1. Temporary intraluminal occlusion of part of the circle of Willis (via internal carotid artery), 2. Abluminal application of the vasoconstrictor peptide (endothelin-1) to the MCA, 3. Tromboembolic models, 4. Microclips. Reliable quantification of morphological changes is also possible. Discussed models are used for testing different types of treatment of the cerebral ischemia, including pharmacological stimulation and blocking of individual membrane receptor systems.
