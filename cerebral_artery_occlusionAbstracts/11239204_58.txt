BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Estrogen is a known neuroprotective and vasoprotective agent in experimental cerebral ischemia. Preischemic steroid treatment protects animals of both sexes from focal cerebral ischemia. This study determined whether intravenous estrogen acts as a vasodilator when administered on reperfusion and whether the resulting increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF) provides tissue protection from middle cerebral artery occlusion. METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats were treated with reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (2 hours), then infused with intravenous estrogen (Premarin; 1 mg/kg) or vehicle during the first minutes of reperfusion (n=15 per group). Cortical laser-Doppler flowmetry was used to assess adequacy of occlusion. Ischemic lesion volume was determined at 22 hours after occlusion by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and image analysis. Cortical and striatal CBF was measured by (14)[C]iodoantipyrine autoradiography at 10 (n=10) or 90 (n=11) minutes of reperfusion. RESULTS: As expected, supraphysiological plasma estrogen levels were achieved during reperfusion (estrogen, 198+/-45 pg/mL; vehicle, 6+/-5; P:=0.001). Physiological variables were controlled and not different between groups. Total hemispheric infarction was reduced in estrogen-treated rats (estrogen, 49+/-4% of ipsilateral structure; vehicle, 33+/-5%; P:=0.02), which was most pronounced in striatum (estrogen, 40+/-6% of ipsilateral striatum; vehicle, 60+/-3%; P:=0.01). CBF recovery was strikingly increased by estrogen infusion at 10 minutes in frontal (estrogen, 102+/-12 mL/100 g per minute; vehicle, 45+/-15; P:=0.01) and parietal cortex (estrogen, 74+/-15 mL/100 g per minute; vehicle, 22+/-13; P:=0.028) and throughout striatum (estrogen, 87+/-13 mL/100 g per minute; vehicle, 25+/-20; P:=0.02). Hemispheric volume with low CBF recovery (eg, <20 mL/100 g per minute) was smaller in estrogen-treated animals (estrogen, 73+/-18 mm(3); vehicle, 257+/-46; P:=0.002). However, differences in CBF recovery could not be appreciated between groups by 90 minutes of reperfusion. CONCLUSIONS: Acute estrogen therapy during reperfusion improves tissue outcome from experimental stroke. The steroid rapidly promotes CBF recovery and reduces hemispheric no-reflow zones. This beneficial effect appears only during early reperfusion and likely complements other known mechanisms by which estrogen salvages brain from focal necrosis.
