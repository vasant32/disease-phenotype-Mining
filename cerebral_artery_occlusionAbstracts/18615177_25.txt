Endocannabinoids are released following brain injury and may protect against excitotoxic damage during the acute stage of injury. Brain injury also activates microglia in a secondary inflammatory phase of more widespread damage. Most drugs targeting the acute stage are not effective if administered more than 6 hours after injury. Therefore, drugs targeting microglia later in the neurodegenerative cascade are desirable. We have found that cannabinoid CB2 receptors are up-regulated during the activation of microglia following brain injury. Specifically, CB2-positive cells appear in the rat brain following both hypoxia-ischemia (HI) and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). This may regulate post-injury microglial activation and inflammatory functions. In this paper we review in vivo and in vitro studies of CB2 receptors in microglia, including our results on CB2 expression post-injury. Taken together, studies show that CB2 is up-regulated during a process in which microglia become primed to proliferate, and then become fully reactive. In addition, CB2 activation appears to prevent or decrease microglial activation. In a rodent model of Alzheimer's disease microglial activation was completely prevented by administration of a selective CB2 agonist. The presence of CB2 receptors in microglia in the human Alzheimer's diseased brain suggests that CB2 may provide a novel target for a range of neuropathologies. We conclude that the administration of CB2 agonists and antagonists may differentially alter microglia-dependent neuroinflammation. CB2 specific compounds have considerable therapeutic appeal over CB1 compounds, as the exclusive expression of CB2 on immune cells within the brain provides a highly specialised target, without the psychoactivity that plagues CB1 directed therapies.
