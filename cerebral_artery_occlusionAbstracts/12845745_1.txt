To investigate the effect of magnesium on nitric oxide synthase (NOS) of neurons in cortex during early cerebral ischemic period, a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was established. The results showed that the NOS activity of neurons in cortex was increased significantly at 15 min after MCAO, reached its peak at 30 min after MCAO and returned to normal levels at 60 min after MCAO. The NOS activity of neurons in the magnesium-treated group was decreased significantly as compared with that in the ischemic group at 15 min and 30 min after MCAO respectively. The results suggested that magnesium could inhibit the elevated NOS activity of neurons in cortex induced by cerebral ischemia.
