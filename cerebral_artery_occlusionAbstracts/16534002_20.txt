Kallikrein cleaves low molecular weight kininogen to generate vasoactive kinins, which bind to the kinin B2 receptor, triggering a host of biological effects. Kallikrein gene delivery has been shown previously to reduce ischemia/reperfusion-induced cerebral infarction. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the kinin B2 receptor plays a protective role in ischemic brain injury using kinin B2 receptor gene knockout (B2R-KO) mice subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The mortality rate and neurological deficit scores of B2R-KO mice (n=48) after MCAO were significantly increased compared with wild-type (WT) mice (n=40) when examined over a 14-day period. In addition, the infarct volume in B2R-KO mice was significantly larger than in WT mice at days 1 and 3 after MCAO. Similarly, apoptotic cells, detected by TUNEL labeling counterstained with propidium iodide, and caspase-3 activity in the ischemic brain increased significantly in B2R-KO mice at days 1 and 3 after MCAO. Furthermore, the accumulation of neutrophils in the ischemic brain of B2R-KO mice after MCAO increased when compared with WT mice and was associated with elevated tumor necrosis factor alpha expression. These alterations in B2R-KO mice correlated with decreased NO levels, Akt, and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta phosphorylation and increased nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide oxidase activity. These results indicate that the kinin B2 receptor promotes survival and protects against brain injury by suppression of apoptosis and inflammation induced by ischemic stroke.
