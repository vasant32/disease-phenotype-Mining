Recently the authors have shown that female stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSPs) in proestrus (high endogenous estrogen), sustain more than 20% smaller infarcts after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) compared with SHRSPs in metestrus (low endogenous estrogen). Because estrogen has vasodilator properties, the authors investigated whether the estrous state influences cerebral blood flow (CBF) after MCAO. CBF was measured 2.5 hours after a distal MCAO by [14C]iodo-antipyrine autoradiography in conscious SHRSPs either in metestrus or in proestrus. There were no significant differences in CBF when analyzed either at predetermined anatomic regions or by cumulative distribution analysis of areas with flow <25 mL/100 g/min. As a positive internal control, the authors compared results in SHRSPs with those in their normotensive reference strain, Wistar Kyoto rat. SHRSPs displayed more severe and widespread ischemia than Wistar Kyoto rats. Thus, the absence of demonstrable CBF differences between estrous states appears to be unrelated to the CBF measurement paradigm. In conclusion, the smaller infarct size afforded in proestrus in SHRSPs is unlikely to be due to an influence on CBF.
