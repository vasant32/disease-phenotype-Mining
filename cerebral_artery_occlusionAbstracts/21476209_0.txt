The present study aimed to investigate the protective effects of injectable caltrop fruit saponin preparation (ICFSP) on ischemia-reperfusion injury in rat brain. Rats were injected with ICFSP and then subjected to cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Then the neurological deficit score was evaluated by Bederson's method. The infarct size was assessed by TTC staining. The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO), and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in rat cerebrum were measured with kits, and the content of 6 K prostaglandin F1α (6-K-PGF 1α), thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and endothelin (ET) in blood plasma was measured by radioimmunoassay. The results demonstrated that ICFSP led to a decrease in infarct size (p < 0.01), neurological deficit score (p < 0.05) and plasma content of TXB2 and ET (p < 0.05), and an increase of the plasma level of 6-K-PGF 1α (p < 0.05) and SOD activity in cerebrum, where the MDA and NO content were decreased. The treatment improved forelimb function. ICFSP showed a similar potency compared to that of Ligustrazine hydrochloride parenteral solution (LHPS) and nimodipine (Nim). We concluded that ICFSP protects the brain damage caused by ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats, and this may be closely related to the regulation of reactive oxygen species (MDA and SOD activity) and NO levels in the rat cerebrum, as well as vasoactive factors in the plasma (6-K-PGF 1α, TXB2 and ET).
