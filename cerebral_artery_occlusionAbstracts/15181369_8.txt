After 24-hour middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in spontaneously hypertensive rats, brain ceramide level increased from baseline reached 595% (ischemic core) and 460% (perifocal/penumbral areas); brain glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) activities in these areas simultaneously decreased by 70% and 50%, respectively. Ten-minute MCAO preconditioning significantly attenuated 24-hour MCAO-induced ceramide accumulation by 40% to 60% in ischemic core and perifocal areas, and GCS activities improved by 60% to 70% in both areas. Thus, potentially toxic levels of brain ceramide induced by MCAO were attenuated to intermediate levels in preconditioned animals; brain GCS activity was relatively preserved. In ischemic tolerance, GCS appears to modulate otherwise high levels of brain ceramide.
