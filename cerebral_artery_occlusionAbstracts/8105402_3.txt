One hour after middle cerebral artery occlusion, the regional blood to brain transfer coefficient of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid was determined in eight barbiturate anaesthetized rats. The transfer coefficient (microliter/min-1/g-1) was significantly higher in the ischaemic cortex (10.6 +/- 2.3) than in the contralateral cortex (6.5 +/- 1.0). Cerebral regional capillary surface area was determined in another group of twelve rats using an alkaline phosphatase stain for the total capillary bed and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran to visualize the perfused capillaries. Perfused capillary surface area (cm2/cm3) was lower in the ischaemic cortex (141 +/- 31) than in the contralateral cortex (426 +/- 32). Using these values for the transfer coefficient, surface area and our previously published data of regional cerebral blood flow after middle cerebral artery occlusion, we calculated the extraction fraction of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid, the permeability-surface area product and the permeability of cerebral regional capillary beds. Although, there are numerous reports of permeability-surface area product of brain capillaries, to our knowledge, the permeability has never been determined before. The calculated extraction fraction ratio for alpha-aminoisobutyric acid for ischaemic cortex/contralateral cortex was 3.1. Similar ratios for permeability-surface area product and capillary permeability were 1.6 and 4.4, respectively. Thus, there was a more than four fold increase in capillary permeability to small molecules in the ischaemic cortex one hour after middle cerebral artery occlusion.
