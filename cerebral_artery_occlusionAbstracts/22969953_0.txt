In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of Korean red ginseng (KRG) following focal brain ischemia/reperfusion injury, in relation to its antioxidant activities. The middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model in rats was employed. The KRG extract (100 mg/kg, perorally) was administered once daily for 7 days following MCAO/R. The elevated levels of lipid peroxidation in the MCAO/R group were attenuated significantly in the KRG-administered group. The significantly depleted activity of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase was prevented in the KRG-administered group. In the neurobehavioral evaluation expressed as the modified neurological severity score and corner-turn test, the daily intake of KRG showed consistent and significant improvement in the neurological deficits for 7 days following MCAO/R injury. These results indicate that KRG has a neuroprotective effect against ischemia/reperfusion brain injury by reducing the level of lipid peroxidation and increasing the endogenous antioxidant enzymatic activity.
