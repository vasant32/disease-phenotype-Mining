Experiments were conducted to determine whether a potent, reversible calpain inhibitor could reduce the cortical ischemic brain damage associated with focal ischemia in the rat. AK275 (Z-Leu-Abu-CONH-CH2CH3), the active isomer of the diastereomeric mixture, CX275, was employed in conjunction with a novel method of perfusing drug directly onto the infarcted cortical surface. This protocol reduced or eliminated numerous, nonspecific pharmacokinetic, hemodynamic, and other potentially confounding variables that might complicate interpretation of any drug effect. Focal ischemia was induced using a variation of the middle cerebral artery occlusion method. These studies demonstrated a reliable and robust neuroprotective effect of AK275 over the concentration range of 10 to 200 microM (perfused supracortically at 4 microliters/h for 21 h). Moreover, a 75% reduction in infarct volume was observed when initiation of drug treatment was delayed for 3 h postocclusion. Our data further support an important role of calpain in ischemia-induced neuropathology and suggest that calpain inhibitors may provide a unique and potentially powerful means of treating stroke and other ischemic brain incidents.
