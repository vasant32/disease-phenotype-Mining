The spatiotemporal dynamics of postischemic hyperperfusion (HP) remains incompletely understood. Diffusion, perfusion, T2, T1, angiographic, dynamic susceptibility-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography were acquired longitudinally at multiple time points up to 7 days after stroke in rats subjected to 30-, 60-, and 90-minutes middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The spatiotemporal dynamics of postischemic HP was analyzed and compared with T1, T2 and blood-brain barrier (BBB) changes. No early HP within 3 hours after recanalization was observed. Late (12 hours) HP was present in all animals of the 30-minute MCAO group (N=20), half of the animals in the 60-minute MCAO group (N=8), and absent in the 90-minute MCAO group (N=9). Dynamic susceptibility-contrast MRI and magnetic resonance angiography corroborated HP. Hyperperfusion preceded T2 increase in some animals, but HP and T2 changes temporally coincided in others. T2 peaked first at 24 hours whereas HP peaked at 48 hours after occlusion, and HP resolved by day 7 in most animals at which point the arteries became tortuous. Pixel-by-pixel tracking analysis showed that tissue did not infarct (migrated from core or mismatch at 30 minutes to normal at 48 hours) showed normal cerebral blood flow (CBF), whereas infarct tissue (migrated from core or mismatch at 30 minutes to infarct at 48 hours) showed exaggerated CBF, indicating that HP was associated with poor outcome.
