Although apoptotic pathways play important roles in ischemic neuronal injury, exact mechanism of apoptotic enzyme cascade has not been fully studied. Immunohistochemical stainings for cytochrome c and caspase-3, and histochemical staining for a terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling method (TUNEL) were examined in a rat model of permanent middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. Cytochrome c was strongly induced in neurons of the ischemic penumbra from 3 h after MCA occlusion, and caspase-3 began to be induced in the same area from 3 h with a peak at 8 h. Neuronal cells in MCA area became TUNEL positive at delayed time, reaching a peak at 24 h. Thus, the peak of induction of cytochrome c preceded that of caspase-3, and these two peaks were also precedence of the peak of DNA-fragmentation. Western blot analysis showed cytosolic expression of cytochrome c from mitochondria. This study demonstrated 1. Rapid release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol, mainly in neurons of the cortex at 3 h after ischemia. 2. Subsequent peaks of caspase-3 and TUNEL in this order. These temporal profiles suggest a serial cascadic activation of apoptotic pathways in neuronal death after permanent MCA occlusion of rats.
