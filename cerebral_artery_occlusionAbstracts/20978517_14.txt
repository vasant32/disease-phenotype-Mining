Valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, is known to protect against cerebral ischemia. The effects of VPA on blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption were investigated in rats subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Postischemic VPA treatment remarkably attenuated MCAO-induced BBB disruption and brain edema. Meanwhile, VPA significantly reduced MCAO-induced elevation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), degradation of tight junction proteins, and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Sodium butyrate, another HDAC inhibitor, mimicked these effects of VPA. Our findings suggest that BBB protection by VPA involves HDAC inhibition-mediated suppression of NF-κB activation, MMP-9 induction, and tight junction degradation.
