Adenoviruses have been proposed as potential vectors for gene therapy in the central nervous system, but there are no reports of their use in the treatment of a brain disease. Because central administration of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein (IL-1ra) reduces ischemic brain damage, we determined whether a recombinant adenovirus vector carrying the human IL-1ra cDNA (Ad.RSVIL-1ra) could be used to ameliorate brain injury in permanent focal ischemia. Groups of six rats received intraventricular injections of Ad.RSVIL-1ra or a control adenovirus containing the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase gene (Ad.RSVlacZ). Histochemical staining for beta-galactosidase 5 days after virus injection indicated that transgene expression was confined primarily to the cells lining the ventricle. The concentrations of IL-1ra injected animals, achieving levels of 9.1 +/- 3.3 ng/g in brain and 23.7 +/- 22.5 ng/ml in CSF. In these animals, cerebral infarct volume resulting from 24 h of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion was reduced 64%. These studies demonstrate that adenoviral vectors can be used to deliver genes that attenuate brain injury.
