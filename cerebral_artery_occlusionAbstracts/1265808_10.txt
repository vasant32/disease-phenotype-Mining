The degree of recovery of the somatosensory cortical evoked response following a period (15 to 65 minutes) of partial ischemia, produced by temporary occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), was assessed in baboons and related to the local tissue blood flow and PO2 before, during and after the occlusion. Flow was measured using the technique of two-minute hydrogen clearance. Failure of complete recovery of the evoked response was associated with significantly greater depths of ischemia and tissue hypoxia during occlusion, and with significantly greater and persisting tissue hypoxia after occlusion, than complete recovery. Complete recovery of the evoked response also was associated with tissue hyperoxia after occlusion. The reduced postocclusive PO2 levels associated with incomplete recovery of the evoked response suggest that reduced perfusion during ischemia was sufficiently severe to cause some degree of irreversible anoxic damage. The effect of a brief (three to ten minutes) period of ventilation with air (instead of oxygen) under such low-flow conditions was to depress the evoked response significantly further; normally perfused brain, however, was unaffected by this procedure. This finding has clinical implications in regard to normobaric oxygen therapy.
