Selective estrogen receptor (ER) agonists can indicate which receptor subtypes are implicated in neuroprotection. This study investigated the contribution of ERbeta, using the selective agonist diarylpropiolnitrile (DPN), in a rat model of stroke. Lister Hooded rats were ovariectomized and implanted with mini-pumps containing either DPN (8 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) (n=7) or vehicle (n=5). Sensorimotor function was assessed using a neurological score and the spontaneous forelimb use asymmetry (cylinder) test. One week later the animals received a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and T(2)-weighted MRI at 48 h post-MCAO quantified ischemic damage. Functional recovery was tested for 7 days post-MCAO and brains processed for histological verification of infarct size. The MRI images revealed no significant differences in hemispheric lesion volumes between vehicle- and DPN-treated groups (35.6+/-3.5% and 30.8+/-1.7%, respectively [mean+/-SEM]; Student's unpaired t-test df=10, t=-1.357, p=0.453); this was confirmed histologically at 7 days. MCAO induced significant decline in neurological score performance (from 22 to 11 at 2 h post-MCAO) in the vehicle-treated animals, which was not significantly influenced by DPN. MCAO also induced significant changes in forelimb use in the cylinder test (10% reduction in contralateral, 20% reduction in both, and 30% increase in ipsilateral forelimb use) but this response was not significantly different between groups [F(1,1)=2.929, p=0.118, repeated-measures ANOVA]. In conclusion, pretreatment with the ERbeta agonist DPN did not influence infarct size or sensorimotor function in rats exposed to MCAO.
