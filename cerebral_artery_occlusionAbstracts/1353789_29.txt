Unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesion of the substantia nigra reduced the volume of striatal necrosis and suppressed the increase in extracellular glutamate concentration in the striatum induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats. These results indicate that the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway is highly involved in the vulnerability of the striatum to ischemia and suggest that glutamate-dopamine interactions may play a key role in the striatal ischemic insult.
