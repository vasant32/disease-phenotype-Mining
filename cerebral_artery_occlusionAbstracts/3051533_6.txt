We evaluated the effect of a stable synthetic prostacyclin analogue, TRK-100, on the microcirculatory derangement occurring in feline pial vessels with endothelial damage after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Fifteen adult cats were divided into an untreated group (Group 1, n = 8) and a treated group (Group 2, n = 7). Thirty minutes after 10 minutes of ultraviolet irradiation, which selectively damaged endothelium in the pial vessels, the middle cerebral artery was occluded in both groups and maintained for 30 minutes. In Group 2, 50 ng/kg/min TRK-100 was continuously infused intravenously following ultraviolet irradiation. In both the pial arteries and veins, platelet aggregate adhesion to the endothelium with subsequent thrombus formation was significantly (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05, respectively) inhibited during middle cerebral artery occlusion in Group 2 compared with Group 1. Similarly, blood flow stasis in the pial veins was effectively prevented in Group 2 during occlusion. Furthermore, the pial artery diameter returned to the control level during the late period of occlusion, whereas in Group 1 the pial artery remained constricted. Our data suggest that TRK-100 can prevent microcirculatory derangement in the acute stage of ischemic stroke.
