BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acute ischemia in the territory of the carotid artery can lead to massive cerebral edema with raised intracranial pressure and progression to coma and death due to uncal, cingulate, or tonsillar herniation. Thus far, only anecdotal experience with supratentorial ischemia treated by decompressive craniectomy has been reported; and there are no published experimental data dealing with this kind of therapy in acute supratentorial stroke. In this study, we present our results on the effect of decompressive craniectomy in an endovascular model of cerebral infarction in rats. METHODS: Focal cerebral ischemia was induced in 50 rats using an endovascular occlusion technique of the middle cerebral artery. Decompressive craniectomy was performed in 30 animals: in 15 animals after 1 hour and in the remaining 15 animals 24 hours after vessel occlusion. Twenty animals were not treated by decompressive craniectomy (control group). RESULTS: Mortality in the nontreated group was 35%, whereas none of the animals treated by decompressive craniectomy died. Neurological behavior, weight loss, and infarction size were all significantly better in the animals treated by decompressive craniectomy, regardless of whether they had been treated after 1 or 24 hours (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that decompressive craniectomy for cerebral ischemia not only reduces mortality but also significantly improves outcome and reduces infarction size, probably because of increased perfusion pressure through leptomeningeal collaterals. This experimental study suggests that a controlled study of decompressive craniectomy in patients with acute internal carotid or middle cerebral artery occlusion would be worthwhile. By performing decompressive craniectomy in a small, selected group of patients, neurosurgeons may play an important role in the management of these patients.
