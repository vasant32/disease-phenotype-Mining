Free radicals have been implicated in neuronal injury during ischemia reperfusion in stroke. Trans resveratrol, a potent antioxidant, polyphenolic compound found in grapes and wines has recently been shown to have neuroprotective activity against oxidative stress in in vitro studies. In the present study the effect of chronic treatment of trans resveratrol was evaluated in focal ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery [MCA] occlusion in rats. Male Wistar rats were pretreated with trans resveratrol 20 mg/kg i.p. for 21 days and were subjected to focal ischemia by occlusion of MCA using intraluminal thread. After two hours of MCA occlusion reperfusion was allowed by retracting the thread. Animals were assessed for motor performance after 24 hours and subsequently rats were sacrificed for estimation of markers of oxidative stress [malondialdehyde [MDA] and reduced glutathione] and for evaluation of volume of infarction. Control group received vehicle and similar protocol was followed. Significant motor impairment, with elevated levels of MDA and reduced glutathione was observed in the vehicle treated MCA occluded rats. Treatment with trans resveratrol prevented motor impairment, rise in levels of MDA and reduced glutathione and also significantly decreased the volume of infarct as compared to control. The study provides first evidence of effectiveness of trans resveratrol in focal ischemia most probably by virtue of its antioxidant property.
