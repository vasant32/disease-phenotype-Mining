We have previously demonstrated that neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) is upregulated and is neuroprotective in ischemic brain injury, however the expression and localization of its receptors during ischemia has not been investigated. Therefore, we used a rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model to examine the distribution of erbB receptors following ischemic stroke. Like neuregulin-1, we observed a dramatic induction of erbB4 in the peri-infarct regions of the ipsilateral cortex 24 h following MCAO. Using Fluoro-Jade B (FJB) staining as a marker of neurodegeneration, erbB4 was upregulated in FJB-positive cells, suggesting that erbB receptors are induced in injured neurons. The increase in erbB receptors was seen in neurons and a subpopulation of macrophages/microglia. There was no erbB co-localization with GFAP-positive astrocytes. These results demonstrate that erbB receptors are upregulated in neurons and macrophages/microglia following ischemic stroke and may be involved in neuroprotection and repair.
