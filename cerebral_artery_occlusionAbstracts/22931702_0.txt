 BACKGROUND: The current study explored the effects of treadmill exercise intensity on functional recovery and hippocampal phospho-NR2B (p-NR2B) expression in cerebral ischemic rats, induced by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery. METHOD: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups, including sham, no exercise (NE), low intensity training (LIT, v = 15 m/min), and moderate intensity training groups (MIT, v = 20 m/min). At different time points, the hippocampal expressions of p-NR2B and total NR2B were examined. In addition, neurological deficit score (NDS), body weight, and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining were used to evaluate brain infarct volume as assessments of post-stroke functional recovery. In order to investigate the effect of exercise on survival, the mortality rate was also recorded. RESULTS: The results showed that treadmill exercise significantly decreased hippocampal expression of p-NR2B but didn't change the total NR2B, compared to the NE group on the 3rd, 7th, and 14th days following MCAO surgery. The effect on changes in p-NR2B levels, body weight, and brain infarct volume were more significant in the LIT compared to the MIT group. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The current findings demonstrate that physical exercise can produce neuroprotective effects, in part by down-regulating p-NR2B expression. Furthermore, the appropriate intensity of physical exercise is critical for post-stroke rehabilitation.
