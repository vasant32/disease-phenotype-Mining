A series of new piperidinyl- and 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridinyl-pyrimidine derivatives were synthesized. Among these compounds, 4-methyl-2-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)pyrimidine derivative 23 (SUN N5147) exhibited sub-nanomolar affinity for 5-HT1A receptor with 1000-fold selectivity over both dopamine D2 and alpha1-adrenergic receptors and remarkable neuroprotective activity in a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (t-MCAO) model.
