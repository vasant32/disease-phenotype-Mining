We previously reported the involvement of conventional protein kinase C (cPKC) βII, γ, novel PKC (nPKC) ε and their interacting proteins in hypoxic pre-conditioning (HPC)-induced neuroprotection. In this study, the large-scale miRNA microarrays and bioinformatics analysis were used to determine the differentially expressed miRNAs and their PKC-isoform specific gene network in mouse brain after HPC and 6 h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). We found 4 up-regulated and 13 down-regulated miRNAs in the cortex of HPC mice, 26 increased and 39 decreased gene expressions of miRNAs in the peri-infarct region of 6 h MCAO mice, and 11 up-regulated and 22 down-regulated miRNAs in the peri-infarct region of HPC and 6 h MCAO mice. Based on Diff Score, 19 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in HPC and 6 h MCAO mouse brain. Then the miRNA-gene-network of 19 specified miRNAs target genes of cPKCβII, γ and nPKCε-interacting protein was predicted by using bioinformatics analysis of genome databases. Furthermore, the down-regulated miR-615-3p during HPC had a detrimental effect on the oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced N2A cell injury. These results suggested that the identified 19 miRNAs, notably miR-615-3p, might target these genes of cPKCβII, γ and nPKCε-interacting proteins involved in HPC-induced neuroprotection.
