The effects of etomidate on focal cerebral ischaemia following transorbital occlusion of the cat middle cerebral artery were investigated. Etomidate had no effect on CBF before or after onset of ischaemia by comparison with controls, but caused a greater fall in CBF in cats with high preocclusion or initial ischaemic CBF than in those in which CBF was lower. There were more sustained rises in Kp on SG. The established flow threshold for water accumulation was lost; more gyri with CBF above and fewer gyri with CBF below the flow threshold accumulated water. The relationship between mean occlusion CBF and in vitro GABA uptake was lost; uptakes from MG were lower and from SG and EG higher than expected. In the ischaemic penumbra there was a trend towards reduction in CBF, disruption of ion homeostasis and cerebral oedema formation, whilst in areas of lower flow there was some recovery of GABA uptake and less cerebral oedema following administration of etomidate.
