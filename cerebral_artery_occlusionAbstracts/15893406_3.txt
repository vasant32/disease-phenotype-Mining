The aim of this study was to examine the role of the hypothalamic hypocretin/orexin system in complications of delayed ischemic neuronal deficit (DIND) resulting from symptomatic vasospasm in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). CSF hypocretin-1/orexin-A levels were measured in 15 SAH patients. DIND complications occurred in seven patients with symptomatic vasospasm. Hypocretin-1/orexin-A levels were low in SAH patients during the 10 days following the SAH event. CSF hypocretin-1/orexin-A levels were lower in patients with DIND complications than in those who did not develop DIND. A significant transient decline in CSF hypocretin-1/orexin-A levels was also observed at the onset of DIND in all patients with symptomatic vasospasm. The reduced hypocretin/orexin production observed in SAH patients may reflect reduced brain function due to the decrease in cerebral blood flow. These results, taken together with recent experimental findings in rats that indicate hypocretin receptor 1 (orexin 1 receptor) mRNA and protein are elevated following middle cerebral artery occlusion, suggest that a reduction in hypocretin/orexin production in SAH and DIND patients is associated with alterations in brain hypocretin/orexin signaling in response to ischemia.
