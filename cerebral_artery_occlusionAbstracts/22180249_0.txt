 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The intraluminal suture technique for producing middle cerebral artery occlusion in rodents is the most commonly used method for modeling focal cerebral ischemia associated with clinical ischemic stroke. Synchrotron radiation angiography may provide a novel solution to directly monitor the success of middle cerebral artery occlusion. METHODS: Twenty adult Sprague-Dawley rats for middle cerebral artery occlusion models were prepared randomly with different suture head silicone coating. In vivo imaging was performed at beam line BL13W1, Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Shanghai, China. RESULTS: Silicone-coated suture was superior to uncoated suture for producing consistent brain infarction. Additionally, silicone coating length was an important variable controlling the extent of the ischemic lesion: infarcts affected predominantly the caudate-putamen with large variability (<2 mm), both the cortex and caudate-putamen (2-3.3 mm), and most of the hemisphere, including the hypothalamus (>3.3 mm). CONCLUSIONS: Synchrotron radiation angiography provides a useful tool to observe hemodynamic changes after middle cerebral artery occlusion, and the physical properties of suture are critical to the success of the middle cerebral artery occlusion model.
