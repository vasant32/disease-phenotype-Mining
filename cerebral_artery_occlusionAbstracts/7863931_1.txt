 PURPOSE: To compare and contrast the physical characteristics of balloon catheter systems used for temporary cerebrovascular occlusion. METHOD: Commonly used temporary occlusion systems were evaluated to determine: (a) balloon compliance; (b) balloon diameter versus volume; (c) balloon pressure versus volume; (d) simulated vessel wall pressure versus volume; (e) balloon failure volume; and (f) balloon deflation rate. Observations were made concerning construction differences that affect the potential safety of a balloon system or the way it is used. RESULTS: The nondetachable balloon system demonstrating the best compliance characteristics and lowest radial pressure generation was the nondetachable silicone balloon (Interventional Therapeutics Corporation, San Francisco, Calif). Diameter versus volume curves for all systems reveal an initial nonlinear expansion that could contribute to vessel overexpansion during occlusion. CONCLUSION: Balloon systems vary in construction, method of introduction, and compliance. Knowledge of these characteristics, as well as of nonlinear balloon expansion, should aid balloon selection and appropriate use while helping to minimize complications.
