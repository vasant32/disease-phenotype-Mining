The effects of ozagrel (CAS 82571-53-7), a thromboxane A2-synthetase inhibitor, and norphenazone (CAS 89-25-8), a free-radical scavenger, on cerebral infarction were assessed using the suture-induced middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model and a microthrombosis model. In the former model, the middle cerebral artery was occluded for 2 h, and the infarction area and volume were evaluated 24 h after the start of reperfusion. In the latter model, microthrombosis were induced by two injections of sodium laurate (interval, 2 days) into the internal carotid artery, and the neurologic deficits were evaluated on the day afer the 2nd injection. Ozagrel at 3 mg/kg decreased both the area and volume of the cortical infarction after ischemia-reperfusion of the middle cerebral artery. Ozagrel also had suppressive effects on the neurologic deficits in the microthrombosis model. Norphenazone at 1 and 3 mg/kg had no clear effects in either model. Since the suture-induced MCAO model and the microthrombosis model are models for occlusion-reperfusion of the major cerebral arteries and lacunar infarction, respectively, these results suggest a highly beneficial effect of ozagrel in the clinical therapy for stroke.
