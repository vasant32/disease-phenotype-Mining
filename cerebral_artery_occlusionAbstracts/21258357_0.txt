 AIM: To examine the effects of a mixed formulation composed of prostaglandin E1 and lithium (PGE1+Li mixture) on brain damage after cerebral ischemia. The effects of the mixture on protein expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs), p53, and Bcl-2 were also determined. METHODS: Brain ischemia was induced with a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) in rats. Rats were treated with a single intravenous administration of PGE1, lithium or a PGE1+Li mixture immediately after the ischemic insult. The infarct volume and motor behavior deficits were analyzed 24 h after the ischemic insult. The protein levels of HSP70, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), HSP60, Bcl-2, and p53 in the striatum of the ipsilateral hemisphere were examined using immunoblotting. RESULTS: The mixture (PGE1 22.6 nmol/kg+Li 0.5 mmol/kg) reduced infarct volume and neurological deficits induced by focal cerebral ischemia. Moreover, the mixture had a greater neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemia compared with PGE1 or lithium alone. The mixture was effective even if it was administered 3 h after ischemia. PGE1+Li also significantly upregulated cytoprotective HSP70, GRP78, HSP60, and Bcl-2 protein levels, while decreasing p53 expression. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated a PGE1+Li mixture with a therapeutic window of up to 3 h for clinical treatment of cerebral ischemia. The PGE1+Li mixture potentially exerts a protective effect after stroke through the induction of HSPs and Bcl-2 proteins.
