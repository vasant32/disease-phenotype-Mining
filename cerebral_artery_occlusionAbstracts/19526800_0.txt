OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy of combined application of deproteinised calf serum injection (DCSI) and acupuncture in treating cerebral ischemia (CI) in rats. METHODS: Ninety Wistar rats were randomly divided into control, CI model, Acupunct (acupuncture), DCSI, Acupunct + DCSI groups, with 18 cases in each group. CI model was duplicated by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). DCSI (80 mg/kg) was given via the rat's tail vein, once daily for 7 days. Acupuncture was applied to "Baihui" (GV 20), "Shuigou" (GV 26), "Neiguan" (PC 6), "Hegu" (LI 4), "Taichong" (LR 3) and "Zusanli" (ST 36), once daily for 7 days. The neurological deficit score (NDS), cerebral infarct volume (CIV), water and lactic acid (LA) contents in cerebral tissues were measured. RESULTS: In comparison with control group, NDS, CIV, cerebral water content and LA in model group increased significantly (P<0.05); while compared with model group, NDS, CIV, cerebral water content and LA in Acupunct, DCSI and Acupunct + DCSI groups decreased significantly (P<0.05). Comparison among DCSI group, Acupunct group and DCSI + Acupunct group showed that NDS, CIV, cerebral water and LA contents of Acupunct + DCSI group were significantly lower than those of the former two groups (P<0.05). No significant differences were found between DCSI and Acupunct groups in the above-mentioned 4 indexes (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Combined application of DCSI and acupuncture has a definite effect in improving cerebral ischemia and is superior to that of simple acupuncture or DCSI alone.
