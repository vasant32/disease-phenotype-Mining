The incidence of infection among stroke patients is alarmingly high and both acute and delayed infections increase morbidity and mortality. Experimental studies support the acute clinical data, but little attention has focused on delayed systemic infections. Here, we investigated the effects of prolonged systemic inflammation either before or 24-h after ischemia. Systemic inflammation was induced by injecting rats with three separate doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 50 mug/kg, i.p.) with core temperature monitoring for 48-h after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Lipopolysaccharide injected before MCAo increased injury by approximately 30%, whereas delayed injection increased injury by approximately 85% (30-day survival). Proinflammatory cytokines assessed repeatedly for 72 h were significantly and persistently elevated with inflammation. This was accompanied by increases in microglia/macrophage and infiltrating leukocyte numbers in delayed LPS-treated animals. Behavioral assessments at 7 and 30 days revealed approximately 15% deficit in hindlimb function in animals treated with LPS 24-h after ischemia. Clearly, delayed and prolonged postischemic systemic inflammation has devastating effects on stroke outcome, in the absence of a prolonged febrile response. These findings, together with corroborative clinical data, emphasize the importance of early intervention to counteract the deleterious consequences of stroke-associated inflammation and infection.
