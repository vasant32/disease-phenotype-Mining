 ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Radix Astragali has been commonly used as traditional herbal medicine in China for reinforcing vital energy, strengthening superficial resistance and promoting the discharge of pus and the growth of new tissue. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was to investigate the neuroprotective effect of calycosin isolated from the roots of Radix Astragali on cerebral ischemic/reperfusion injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After 24h of reperfusion following ischemia for 2h induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), Sprague-Dawley rats were intragastrically administered different doses of calycosin (7.5, 15, 30 mg/kg, respectively). Neurological deficit, infarct volume, histopathology changes and some oxidative stress markers were evaluated after 24h of reperfusion. RESULTS: Treatment with calycosin significantly ameliorated neurologic deficit and infarct volume after cerebral ischemia reperfusion. Calycosin also reduced the content of malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and up-regulated the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, calycosin can also inhibit the expression of 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that calycosin has a neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. The mechanism might be attributed to its antioxidant effects.
