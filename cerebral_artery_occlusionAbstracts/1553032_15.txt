To identify regional vasodilatory capacity and its sequential change, we evaluated prospectively a total of 78 acetazolamide tests in 51 patients with occlusion or greater than 75% stenosis of the carotid or middle cerebral arteries. The relative distribution of cerebral blood flow was determined by single photon emission computed tomography using N-isopropyl-p-[123I]-iodoamphetamine before and after intravenous injection of acetazolamide. Reduced vasodilatory capacity was demonstrated in 20 patients (38%), including 5 patients with hemodynamic transient ischemic attacks or infarction. Follow-up acetazolamide tests revealed asymptomatic progression of the arterial lesion (from stenosis to occlusion) in 1 patient and almost complete improvement of vasodilatory capacity in 5 patients, including 3 without surgical intervention. During an average follow-up period of 18.5 months, 4 patients died from cardiac causes or neoplasm; no neurovascular events occurred. Much larger numbers of patients with longer observation periods will be necessary to clarify the contribution of chronic hemodynamic failure to subsequent stroke. However, the present data indicate that the acetazolamide test is useful for assessing the course of high grade stenosis or occlusion of major cerebral arteries.
