The temporal profiles of MRI parameters which use quantitative estimates of magnetization transfer were measured in 22 male Wistar rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion, with and without therapeutic intervention with an anti-ICAM-1 monoclonal antibody. Two measures were used: the value of a magnetization transfer-related parameter in a predetermined region of interest, and the area of damage, as measured by changes in this parameter. In both groups, the value and area of damage of the inverse of the apparent forward transfer rate for magnetization transfer (1/k(fa)) significantly increased from the preischemic values (P < 0.05), as did T1 under an off-resonance partial saturation of the macromolecular pool (T1sat), and T1 (P < 0.05). Moreover, the increase in the value and total area of damage, as measured by 1/k(fa), T1, and T1sat in the treated group, was smaller compared to that of the untreated group, with significant differences detected between groups at 5, 24, and 48 hours. Our data suggest that a quantitative measure of MT may provide a sensitive and early method to detect the efficacy of therapeutic intervention in experimental stroke.
