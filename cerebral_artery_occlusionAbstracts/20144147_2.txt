BACKGROUND: Increased levels of lactate are observed by (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) in rat brains after stroke. However, it is not known whether the changes in lactate levels are predictive of the degree of neuronal damage. PURPOSE: To investigate the correlation between changes in lactate and lipid levels measured by (1)H-MRS and neuronal cell damage in the rat brain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was used to evaluate focal ischemia in rats (n=36). After MCAO for 90 min T2-weighted images (T2WIs), diffusion-weighted images (DWIs), and (1)H-MRS data were obtained from brains immediately, 6 hours, 9 hours, 12 hours, 18 hours, 24 hours, 3 days, and 7 days after reperfusion. Infarct volumes were measured in T2WIs obtained 4 weeks after reperfusion. The degree of neuronal damage was measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining in three rats from each group at the same time as brain images were collected. RESULTS: Creatine (Cr)-normalized lactate + lipid levels ([Lac+Lip]/Cr) were negatively correlated with Cr-normalized N-acetyl-L-aspartate levels (NAA/Cr) and positively correlated with TUNEL-positive cell numbers up to 24 hours after reperfusion. (Lac+Lip)/Cr at 6 hours and 9 hours was significantly correlated with NAA/Cr at 7 days, but there was no significant correlation between (Lac+Lip)/Cr during the first 24 hours and infarct volume at 4 weeks. CONCLUSION: Up to 24 hours after reperfusion, (Lac+Lip)/Cr was strongly negatively correlated with NAA/Cr, and was a good predictor of neuronal damage at 7 days; however, it was not predictive of final infarct volume at 4 weeks.
