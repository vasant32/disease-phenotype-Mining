OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of ligustrazine on cell proliferation in subventricular zone (SVZ) in rat brain with focal cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury. METHODS: Male SD rats were randomly divided into a normal group,a sham operation group,a ligustrazine treatment group, and a control group. The ligustrazine treatment group and the control group were further divided into 5 subgroups: 1d, 3d, 7d, 14d, and 21d reperfusion after 2h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion model was made by MCAO. S phase cells were labelled with BrdU. Immunohistochemistry method was conducted to detect the BrdU positive cells. The total number of BrdU positive cells in the SVZ was measured. The expression of neuro nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) was detected with Western blot method. RESULTS: There was a significant increase of BrdU positive cells in SVZ of ligustrazine treatment in the 1d and 3d group compared with that of the control group (P<0.01). The total number of BrdU positive cells reached a peak in 7d group and declined afterwards. Cells proliferated also in SVZ on the contralateral side, and peaked at 7d. The nNOS expression of ligustrazine administration after the focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion decreased at 1d and 3d after the reperfusion compared with that of the control group (P<0.05), and increased at 7d, but with no significant difference compared with that of the control group. CONCLUSION: Ligustrazine may promote the cell proliferation in SVZ of adult rats with ischemia-reperfusion injury by decreasing the nNOS expression.
