BACKGROUND: Endovascular stroke therapy is used for patients with ischemic stroke after failed intravenous thrombolysis or in patients not eligible for thrombolytics. With increasing experience, acute reocclusion has been described and likely worsens clinical outcomes. We assessed the rates and outcomes of delayed symptomatic reocclusion after endovascular therapy for acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: Patients with acute ischemic stroke undergoing endovascular procedures at out institutions from January 2008 to August 2008 were reviewed. In all, 107 consecutive acute stroke interventions were performed. Four patients (3.5%) experienced delayed symptomatic reocclusion detectable by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). RESULTS: The 4 patients (age 45-79 years) had baseline NIHSS score ranging from 8 to 24. Three had right middle cerebral artery occlusions and one had a left middle cerebral artery occlusion. Successful recanalization (thrombolysis in myocardial infarction score 2-3) occurred in all cases after initial treatment. All patients improved postprocedure (NIHSS score 5-10). Clinical deterioration (NIHSS score 14-22) occurred 12 to 18 hours postprocedure. Successful recanalization was achieved in each patient, with improvement in NIHSS score (range 6-13) but not to a lower level compared with after the initial intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed symptomatic reocclusion after initial endovascular stroke therapy can lead to sudden clinical deterioration and impact outcomes. The entity may be missed as many patients present with large clinical deficits at presentation thus requiring careful assessments of patients treated via endovascular methods.
