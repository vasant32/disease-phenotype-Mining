Following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion, extracellular penumbral glutamate levels, measured by a real-time glutamate electrode, increased in two different patterns. In 7/11 rats, glutamate increased from baseline levels of 19+/-4 (mean+/-SEM) to 208+/-29 microM and then declined towards baseline levels. Blood flow in the penumbral area declined to 30% of pre-ischemic levels with recovery to 60 and 70% of baseline values by 3 and 6 h, respectively. Four of 11 rats in the study also exhibited late peaks of glutamate release (120+/-40 microM ) 2 h after the onset of ischemia. There were no changes in the EEG recordings or cerebral blood flow during these late glutamate peaks.
