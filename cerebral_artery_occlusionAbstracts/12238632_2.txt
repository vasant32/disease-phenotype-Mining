We examined the effects of mild to moderate hypothermia and the influence of rewarming on electrophysiological function using somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in transient focal ischemia in the brain. Nineteen cats underwent 60 min of left middle cerebral artery occlusion under normothermic (36 degrees-37 degrees C, n = 6) or hypothermic (30 degrees -31 degrees C, n = 13) conditions followed by 300 min of reperfusion with slow (120 min, n = 6) or rapid (30 min, n = 7) rewarming. Whole-body hypothermia was induced during ischemia and the first 180 min of reperfusion. SEPs and regional cerebral blood flow were measured before and during ischemia and during reperfusion. The specific gravity of gray and white matter was examined as the indicator of edema. During rewarming, SEP amplitudes recovered gradually. After rewarming, SEPs in the normothermic and rapid rewarming groups remained depressed (20%-40% of pre-occlusion values); however, recovery of SEPs was significantly enhanced in the slow rewarming group (p < 0.05). Hypothermia followed by slow rewarming reduced edema in gray and white matter. Rapid rewarming did not reduce edema in the white matter. The recovery of SEPs correlated with the extent of brain edema in transient focal ischemia. Rapid rewarming reduced the protective effect of hypothermia.
