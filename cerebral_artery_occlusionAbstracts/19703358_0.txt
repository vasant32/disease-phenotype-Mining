 OBJECTIVE: To observe the expression of Nav1.1 and the effect of electroacupuncture therapy (ET) on it after acute cerebral ischemia. METHODS: Focal acute cerebral ischemic model was established by occluding right middle cerebral artery. One hundred and forty-five male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: sham operation group, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group, ET group and riluzole group. Double immunofluorescence and real-time PCR were used to observe Nav1.1 expression, and TTC staining was used to detect infarct volume at 6 hours, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days and 7 days after ischemia. RESULTS: The expression of Nav1.1 in sham operation group had no change. After ischemia, the expression of Nav1.1 was up-regulated evidently at 6 hours compared with sham operation group, down-regulated at 1 day and up-regulated again from 2 to 7 days after ischemia; the expression at 7 days was lower than that at 6 hours. In ET group and riluzole group, Nav1.1 expression were down-regulated compared with that in MCAO group after ischemia, the infarct volume was smaller than that in MCAO group at the same time point, and the difference is significant (p<0.05); however, the difference between ET group and riluzole group is not significant (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: ET and riluzole could regulate the expression of Nav1.1 after ischemia, decrease the infarction volume and reduce cerebral ischemic injury. One of the important mechanisms for ET's cerebral protective function may be that it could regulate the expression of Nav1.1 after ischemia.
