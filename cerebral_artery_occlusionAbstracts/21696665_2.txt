We report the immediate technical and clinical outcome of a new self-expanding fully retrievable stent in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Eleven consecutive patients with acute intracerebral artery occlusions were treated with a self-expandable fully retrievable intracranial stent (Solitaire AB). Four patients had an occlusion of the basilar artery, five had a middle cerebral artery occlusion and two had terminal carotid artery occlusions. Recanalization results were assessed by follow-up angiography immediately after the procedure. Neurologic status was evaluated before and after treatment (90-day follow-up) according to the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin scales (mRS).Successful revascularization (TICI 2a/b and 3) was achieved in 11 of 11 (100%) patients, a TICI 3 state was accomplished in two (18%) patients, and partial recanalization or slow distal branch filling with filling of more than two-thirds of the vessel territory (TICI 2a/2b) was achieved in nine (82%) patients. The stent was removed in all patients. The mean time from stroke symptom onset to recanalization was 339 minutes (+/- 114.3 minutes). NIHSS on admission was 16.09 (+/- 4.7). Almost two-thirds of the patients (61.2%) improved by >6 points on the NIHSS at discharge, and 30% showed a mRS of <2 at 90 days. Mortality was 9%. One patient with a BA occlusion had a massive brain stem infarction and died two days after the procedure. There were no intracranial hemorrhages.The use of the Solitaire in ischemic stroke patients shows encouraging results. However, further prospective large randomized trials are mandatory to confirm these early results.
