Incidence of cerebral vascular disease (CVD) is higher in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) than that in individuals without DM, and neuronal apoptosis determines the severity of cerebral infarction. However, there is no effective therapy for CVD. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), a potent hematopoietic factor, could inhibit apoptosis of hematopoietic progenitor cells. However, its effect on neuronal cells is still unclear. In this study, we investigated the anti-apoptosis properties of G-CSF in neurons following focal cerebral ischemia in diabetic rats. The diabetic condition was generated in rats by intravenous injection of streptozotocin. After 6 weeks, diabetic rats underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and received subcutaneous administration of G-CSF (50 microg/kg) daily for 7, 14 or 21 days. We analyzed the changes in neurological severity scores, infarct volume, number of apoptotic neurons, and the expression of G-CSF receptor, phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3), cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2 (cIAP2), Bcl-2, and Bax in the brain tissue. Bax is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family. The DM rats treated with G-CSF not only showed the reduced infarct volume and decreased apoptosis cell number, but also presented improved neurological scores. The G-CSF also increased the expression of pSTAT3, Bcl-2, and cIAP2 proteins as well as Bcl-2 mRNA, but inhibited Bax protein expression in the brain. These results indicate that G-CSF partially increases neuronal survival by affecting apoptosis pathways. G-CSF provides a potential treatment for stroke and other neurological dysfunction accompanied by neuronal apoptosis.
