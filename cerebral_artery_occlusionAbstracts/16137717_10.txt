In the present study, the effects of paeoniflorin (PF), a characteristic monoterpene glucoside isolated from Paeoniae Radix, on cerebral infarction, neurological symptoms, tongue protrusion (TP) and performance in the water maze were examined at the chronic stage (4 weeks) of transient cerebral ischemia using a rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. One-day (10 mg/kg, twice, s.c.) or seven-day (2.5-10 mg/kg, twice a day, s.c.) injection of PF significantly reduced the infarct volume as well as ameliorated the deficits in neurological symptoms caused by transient MCAO at chronic stage. Transient MCAO also induced impairments in TP and performance in the water maze. Treatment with PF was able to reverse or alleviate these impairments. These results indicate that PF may be effective for treatment of stroke.
