Summary: We reviewed retrospectively our experience in treating 10 patients with acute vertebrobasilar occlusion. Nine patients were treated with interventional reperfusion therapy and the remaining one patient with top of the basilar embolism was treated conservatively because of deep coma and decerebrate rigidity with severely reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the brain stem. Among 9 patients with reperfusion therapy, 8 patients underwent intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy and the other one patient had direct percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). Eight patients had basilar artery occlusion, 1 patient treated with direct PTA had bilateral intracranial vertebral artery occlusion and the other patient had left posterior cerebral artery occlusion presumably preceding top of the basilar embolism. In 4 of 10 patients, residual CBF was evaluated by single photon emission computed tomograpy (SPECT). Successful recanalization with clinical improvement was achieved in 6 of 9 patients (66.7%) treated with reperfusion therapy. In patients with progression or fluctuation of incomplete brain stem syndrome, SPECT revealed preserved residual CBF and successful recanalization with clinical improvement was achieved by interventional reperfusion therapy. On the other hand, in patients with persistent deep coma and decerebrate rigidity, SPECT revealed marked reduction of residual CBF in the brain stem and recanalization could not improve clinical outcome. Preoperative SPECT may be useful to make a decision whether rep er fusion therapy should be performed or not in case of vertebrobasilar occlusion.
