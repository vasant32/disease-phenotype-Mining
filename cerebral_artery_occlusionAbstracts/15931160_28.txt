After stroke, the blood-brain barrier is transiently disrupted, allowing leukocytes to enter the brain and brain antigens to enter the peripheral circulation. This encounter of normally sequestered brain antigens by the systemic immune system could therefore present an opportunity for an autoimmune response to brain to occur after stroke. In this study, we assessed the immune response to myelin basic protein (MBP) in animals subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Some animals received an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 mg/kg) at reperfusion to stimulate a systemic inflammatory response. At 1 month after MCAO, animals exposed to LPS were more likely to be sensitized to MBP (66.7% versus 22.2%; P=0.007) and had more profound and persistent neurologic deficits than non-LPS-treated animals. Exposure to LPS was associated with increased expression of the costimulatory molecule B7.1 early after stroke onset (P=0.009) and increased brain atrophy 1 month after MCAO (P=0.03). These data suggest that animals subjected to a systemic inflammatory insult at the time of stroke are predisposed to develop an autoimmune response to brain, and that this response is associated with worse outcome. These data may partially explain why patients who become infected after stroke experience increased morbidity.
