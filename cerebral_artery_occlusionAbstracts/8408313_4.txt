Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a key enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis, is induced in ischemic tissue and may mediate vasogenic edema and delayed neuronal death. We determined the effects of alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a specific inhibitor of ODC, on infarct size and ODC activity in a rat model of transient focal ischemia. DFMO blocked the ischemia-induced increase in ODC and significantly reduced infarct volumes by 57-45%, depending upon the treatment regimen. These studies suggest that polyamine metabolism plays a role in the development of cerebral infarction after focal ischemia and that DFMO may be useful in limiting injury after a stroke.
