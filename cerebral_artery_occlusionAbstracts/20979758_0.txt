 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanism of protective effect of Xingnaojing and Xuesaitong injections on cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury in rats. METHODS: The focal cerebral ischemia & reperfusion model was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). A total of 152 male SD rats were randomly assigned into 19 groups: sham operated group, Xingnaojing group, Xingnaojing plus Xuesaitong group and control group according to different reperfusion durations: 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 72 h. Each group had 8 rats. Rats in Xingnaojing group received the ip injections of Xingnaojing (1 ml x 100 (-1) x d(-1)) until an onset of ischemia; Xingnaojing plus Xuesaitong group received the ip injections of Xingnaojing (1 ml x 100 g(-1) x d(-1)) and Xuesaitong (1 ml x 100 g(-1) x d(-1)) until an onset of ischemia; In the meantime, rats in control group received the same ip dose of saline. The levels of SOD and MDA were detected. The number of apoptotic neurons was detected by terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase medicated nick end labeling (TUNEL). RESULTS: During ischemic reperfusion, the MDA content of brain homogenate increased while the SOD activity decreased (P < 0.05). Xingnaojing could significantly inhibit the increase of MDA after cerebral ischemic reperfusion (P < 0.05) and the decrease of SOD activity in rats. The changes of SOD and MDA were smaller in the Xingnaojing plus Xuesaitong group than those in the Xinnaojing group (P < 0.01). The number of apoptotic neurons in the Xingnaojing group was significantly lower than that in control group (P < 0.05). And the number of apoptotic neurons in the Xingnaojing plus Xuesaitong group was even lower than that in the Xingnaojing group(4,8 h: P < 0.05, 24, 48, 72 h: P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The Xingnaojing plus Xuesaitong injection has protective function after cerebral ischemic reperfusion.
