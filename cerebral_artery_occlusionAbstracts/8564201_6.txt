1. Changes in the peripheral type benzodiazepine binding site density following middle cerebral artery occlusion in the mouse, have been used as a marker of neuronal damage. These sites can be identified using the selective ligand [3H]-PK 11195 located on non neuronal cells, macrophages and astroglia, within the CNS. Glial cell proliferation and macrophage invasion is an unvoidable sequelae to cerebral ischaemic injury, secondary to neuronal loss. Following occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (left MCA) a reproducible lesion was found in the parietal cortex within 7 days which gave rise to a significant increase in [3H]-PK 11195 binding. 2. Treatment of animals with the sodium channel blocker, lifarizine, significantly reduced the ischaemia-induced increase in [3H]-PK 11195 binding when given either 30 min pre-ischaemia and three times daily for 7 days at 0.5 mg kg-1, i.p. (P < 0.01) or delayed until 15 min post-ischaemia and three times daily for 7 days at 0.5 mg kg-1, i.p. (P < 0.001). Lifarizine was an effective neuroprotective agent in this model of focal ischaemia in the mouse. 3. Lifarizine also showed a dose-related protection against the ischaemia-induced increase in [3H]-PK 11195 binding with significant protection at doses of 0.1 mg kg-1, i.p. (P < 0.05), 0.25 mg kg-1, i.p. (P < 0.01) or 0.5 mg kg-1, i.p. (P < 0.01) 15 min post-ischaemia and b.i.d. for 7 days. No significant change is seen in the Kd for [3H]-PK 11195. The first dose could be delayed for up to 4 h after cerebralartery cauterization and protection was maintained.4. Phenytoin (28 mg kg-1, i.v. 15 min and 24 h post-ischaemia) was also neuroprotective in this model(P<0.01). This agent is thought to interact with voltage-dependent sodium channels to effect its anticonvulsantactions and this mechanism may also underlie its neuroprotective actions in focal cerebralischaemia.5. Agents with other mechanisms of action were also shown to have significant neuroprotection in this model. The non-competitive NMDA antagonist, MK 801, showed significant neuroprotection in the model when given at 0.5 mg kg-1, i.p. 30 min pre-ischaemia with t.i.d. dosing for 7 days (P< 0.001). The dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, nimodipine was not protective when given using the same dosing protocol as MK 801, 0.5 mg kg-1 30 min pre-occlusion and three times daily for 7 days but showed significant protection when given at 0.05 mg kg-1 15 min post-ischaemia and three times daily for 7days. The lipid peroxidation inhibitor, tirilazad (single dose 1 mg kg-1, i.v.) showed significant neuroprotection when given 5 min post-ischaemia but not when the first dose was delayed for 4 h.
