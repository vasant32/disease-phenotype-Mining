Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a potent pleiotrophic peptide which has a trophic role for neuronal cells. As it exerts its effect only after a conversion to its heterodimeric active form, the activation step, which is catalyzed by an enzyme serine protease named HGF activator (HGFA), is of great importance. HGF activated by HGFA may act as a protecting agent in injured brain. In the present study, we investigated expression of immunoreactive HGF and HGFA in rat brain after permanent middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. By immunohistochemical analysis, HGF and HGFA were normally expressed only in ependymal cells and choroid plexus. At 1 h after MCA occlusion, neurons in the ischemic penumbra region of the cerebral cortex slightly expressed immunoreactive HGFA. HGF was not induced at that time. At 3 h of ischemia, however, immunoreactive HGF as well as HGFA became detectable in neurons of the ischemic cerebral cortex and caudate. Immunoreactivity for HGF continued to increase until 24 h, while that for HGFA remained almost constant from 3 to 24 h. No glial or vascular endothelial cells expressed HGF nor HGFA. By Western blot analysis for HGF, a single band of molecular weight (MW) 34 kDa became apparent at 24 h, corresponding to the light chain of the active form HGF. The present study suggests that HGF and HGFA were induced in neurons under permanent ischemia with slightly different temporal profiles. Through activation by HGFA, the active form of HGF could serve as a neurotrophic factor in ischemic brain.
