Ischemic stroke is among the leading causes of mortality and long-term disability in the western world. Despite enormous research activities in the last decades, current therapeutic options for acute stroke patients are still very limited. Reliable and realistic in vivo animal models represent sine qua non for -successful translation from bench to bedside. To date, several animal models of focal and global cerebral ischemia have been developed to mimic the clinical situation in humans as accurately as possible. This chapter focuses on models of focal cerebral ischemia, in particular on the most commonly used model: the intraluminal filament model of middle cerebral artery occlusion. The main objective is to provide a detailed instruction manual for researchers interested in learning this technique.
