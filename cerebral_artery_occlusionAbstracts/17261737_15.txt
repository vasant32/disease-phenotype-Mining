The ability of the central nervous system to cope with stressful conditions was shown to be dependent on proper T-cell-mediated immune response. Because the therapeutic window for neuroprotection after acute insults such as stroke is relatively narrow, we searched for a procedure that would allow the relevant T cells to be recruited rapidly. Permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion was induced in adult rats. To facilitate a rapid poststroke T cell activity, rats were treated with poly-YE using different regimens. Control and poly-YE-treated rats were assessed for functional recovery using neurological severity score and Morris water maze. Neuroprotection, neurogenesis, growth factor expression, and microglial phenotype were assessed using histological and immunofluorescence methods. Administration of poly-YE as late as 24 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion yielded a beneficial effect manifested by better neurological performance, reduced neuronal loss, attenuation of behavioral deficits, and increased hippocampal and cortical neurogenesis. This compound affected the subacute phase by modulating microglial response and by increasing local production of insulin-like growth factor-I, known to be a key player in neuronal survival and neurogenesis. The relative wide therapeutic window, coupled with its efficacy in attenuating further degeneration and enhancing restoration, makes poly-YE a promising immune-based candidate for stroke therapy.
