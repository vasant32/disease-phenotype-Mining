OBJECTIVE: To observe the protective effects of total glycosides Rubus parviflolius (TGRP) on local cerebral ischemic. METHOD: The local cerebral ischemia in rat was made by middle cerebral artery occlusion(MACO). The infraction weight was determined by TTC stain. SOD, MDA, GSH and apoptotis were determined with different method respectively. RESULT: TGRP 20, 10 mg x kg(-1) ig markedly improved the abnormal nervous symptoms, incredsed the SOD, GSH activity and reduced contentes of MDA in brain of MACO rat, TGRP 20 mg x kg(-1) ig significantly decreased the numbers of apoptotic cells in ischemic cortex. CONCLUSION: TGRP has protective effects against cerebral infraction, and its mechanism may be related to anti-apoptotis and free radical.
