BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Both NO and superoxide cytotoxicity are important in experimental stroke; however, it is unclear whether these molecules act within parallel pathological pathways or as coreagents in a common reaction. We examined these alternatives by comparing outcomes after middle cerebral artery occlusion in male and female neuronal NO synthase (nNOS)-deficient (nNOS-/-) or human CuZn superoxide dismutase-overexpressing (hSOD1+/-) mice and a novel strain with both mutations. METHODS: Permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion was performed by use of the intraluminal filament technique (18 hours). Neurological status was scored, and tissue infarction volume was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium staining and image analysis. RESULTS: Hemispheric infarction volume was reduced in each transgenic strain relative to the genetically matched, wild-type, control cohorts (WT mice): nNOS-/- (80+/-6 mm(3)) and double-mutant (49+/-6 mm(3)) mice versus WT mice (114+/-7 mm(3)) and hSOD1+/- mice (52+/-7 mm(3)) versus WT mice (95+/-5 mm(3)). Human CuZn superoxide dismutase had a larger effect on mean infarction volume (30% of contralateral hemisphere) than did nNOS deficiency (46%). Although infarction volume was less in double-mutant mice compared with nNOS-/- mice, injury was not improved relative to hSOD1+/- mice. There was no difference in histological damage by sex within each strain; however, female nNOS-/- mice were not protected from ischemic injury, unlike male mutants. CONCLUSIONS: Superoxide generation contributes to severe ischemic brain injury in vivo to a greater extent than does neuronally derived NO. In vivo, significant superoxide scavenging by CuZn superoxide dismutase occurs within cellular compartments or through biochemical pathways that are not restricted to, and may be distinct from, neuronal NO/superoxide reaction and peroxynitrite synthesis.
