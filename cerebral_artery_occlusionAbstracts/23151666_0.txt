Microglia are the major immune cells in the central nervous system and play             a key role in brain injury pathology. However, the role of activated microglia             after subacute cerebral ischemia (SCI) remains unknown. To address this issue,             we established a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) rat model             and treated pMCAO rats with N-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydro-phenanthridin-2-yl)-N,N-dimethylacetamide             (PJ34) (an inhibitor of microglial activation), or with vehicle alone. Finally,             we determined the differences between the PJ34-and vehicle-treated rats with respect             to neurological deficits, infarct volume, neuronal loss and the expression of             CD11b (a marker of microglial activation), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic             factor (GDNF) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) at 1, 3 and 7 days after treatment.             We found that the PJ34-treated rats had more severe neurological deficits and             a larger infarct volume and exhibited a decreased CD11b expression, more neuronal             loss, decreased expression of GDNF mRNA and protein but increased expression of             TNF-α mRNA and protein compared with the vehicle-treated rats at 3 and 7 days             after treatment. These results indicate that activated microglia provide a neuroprotective             role through balancing GDNF and TNF-α expression following SCI.
