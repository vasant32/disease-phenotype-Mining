Internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection with tandem internal carotid and middle cerebral artery occlusion may carry a poor prognosis even if intravenous recombinant-tissular plasminogen activator is administered. A better outcome may be expected with the combination of intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular methods (stenting and thromboaspiration). This procedure was performed in 3 patients who had concurrent ICA dissection and intracerebral occlusion. Endovascular treatment was feasible and safe. All our patients had a good clinical outcome. This potential effective approach may need further validation.
