 OBJECTIVES: Modified Bo-Yang-Hwan-O-Tang (mBHT) is an improved herbal formula of BHT, which has been widely used to treat ischaemic stroke in East Asia, by the addition of five herbs having anti-ischaemic properties. In this study, we investigated whether mBHT would reduce cerebral ischaemic injury in rats. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a 90-min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and subsequent 22-h reperfusion. mBHT was administered either intraperitoneally twice 15 min before and 15 min after, or orally once 30 min or 120 min after the onset of MCAO (50 or 200 mg/kg each). KEY FINDINGS: Intraperitoneal administration of mBHT markedly reduced the cerebral infarct size and neurological deficit caused by MCAO/reperfusion. mBHT treatment also significantly improved long-term survival rate after cerebral ischaemic injury. Oral administration of mBHT 30 min after ischaemia also markedly reduced the infarct size after cerebral ischaemia. The anti-ischaemic effect of mBHT was significantly, but not fully, reduced when mBHT-induced hypothermia was abolished. In cultured cortical neurons, we further found that mBHT decreased oxygen-glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation-evoked neuronal injury by inhibiting production of reactive oxygen species, decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and activation of caspase-3. However, mBHT did not inhibit N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated excitotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data suggest that mBHT has multiple anti-ischaemic properties and would be a good therapeutic herbal prescription for the treatment of cerebral ischaemic stroke.
