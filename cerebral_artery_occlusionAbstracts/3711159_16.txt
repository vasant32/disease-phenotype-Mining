The effect of the administration of nimodipine (1 microgram kg-1 min-1), initiated 5 min after occlusion of a middle cerebral artery (MCA), upon cerebral haemodynamics ([14C]iodoantipyrine autoradiography) and neuropathological outcome (volume of histologically ischaemic tissue) was investigated in anaesthetized rats. Measurements were made of the level of local CBF (LCBF) in a total of 37 neuroanatomically defined areas, either ipsilateral or contralateral to the occluded vessel, and the autoradiograms were examined using a new approach to quantitative densitometry that employed a frequency distribution analysis of the CBF in sections of the brain at different coronal planes. Both methods of analysis showed that nimodipine, administered after the ischemic event, did not modify the pattern of CBF distribution after MCA occlusion. The extent of ischaemic brain damage was determined by histological examination. There was no evidence that the extent of ischaemic damage, either in sections at eight different coronal planes or in overall volume, was significantly different in animals that received nimodipine from that observed in animals that received only the vehicle used to dissolve the drug. The lack of cerebral circulatory and neuropathological alterations when nimodipine administration is initiated after occlusion of the MCA is contrasted with the higher levels of LCBF and the reductions in the volume of ischaemic tissue that were found when nimodipine was administered before occlusion of the artery.
