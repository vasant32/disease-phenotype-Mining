This study examined the effects of permanent, unilateral cerebral artery occlusion on the somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) recorded from the ipsilateral cortex in the anaesthetised rat. Ten days after artery occlusion the SEP was absent in the majority of rats tested and in the remainder the wave amplitude was reduced compared to the potential recorded from the normal hemisphere but latency was unaffected. Histochemical staining with Tetrazolium for infarct size has shown that loss of the SEP correlated with ischaemic damage to the cortex. SEP recording can be used to assess the extent of cortical ischaemia in this small animal model.
