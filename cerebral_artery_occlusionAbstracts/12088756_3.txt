This work aimed to define the spatial expression of endothelin A (ET(A)) and B (ET(B)) receptors in the cerebral cortex after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and to identify the phenotype of cells expressing ET(A) and ET(B) receptors. Cortical expression of ET(A) and ET(B) receptors was determined at the mRNA level by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and at the protein level by immunofluorescence staining, 12, 24 and 72 h after MCAO. Cells expressing endothelin receptors were phenotyped by double labelling with antibodies, anti-protein gene product (PGP9.5) and anti-ED1, towards neurons and activated microglia/macrophages, respectively. Both ET(A) and ET(B) receptor mRNA expressions increased significantly in the ipsilateral cortex in a time-dependent manner after MCAO. Robust expression of ET(A) receptors was noted in most neurons of the ischemic core and in several neurons in laminae 3 and 4 of the peri-infarct region 24 and 72 h after MCAO. ET(B) receptor immunoreactivity was observed in activated microglia/macrophages, beginning 24 h after MCAO. These results provide the first evidence that the action of endothelin during ischemia may be mediated by neuronal ET(A) receptors and activated microglia/macrophage ET(B) receptors. This differential localization of ET(A) and ET(B) receptors suggests that endothelin is involved in some complex neuron-glial interactions in addition to its vascular modulatory activity during ischemia.
