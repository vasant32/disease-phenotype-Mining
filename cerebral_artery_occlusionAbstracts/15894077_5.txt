In the present study, we evaluated delayed treatment effects of the proteasome inhibitor and anti-inflammatory agent MLN519 (initiated 10 h post-injury) to improve recovery following ischemic brain injury in rodents. Male rats were exposed to 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) and treated with MLN519 (1.0 mg/kg, i.v. @ 10, 24, and 48 h post-occlusion) or vehicle. By 2 weeks post-injury, 60% (6/10) of vehicle animals survived, which was improved (although non-significantly) to 78% (7/9) following MLN519 treatment. The percent loss of tissue in the ipsilateral brain hemisphere (at 2 weeks) was significantly reduced from 27+/-4% (vehicle) to 15+/-4% (MLN519). MLN519 treated animals also lost significantly less body weight (39%) and showed significant improvement in overall neurological function across the 2-week recovery period. However, no significant treatment effects were observed to reduce foot-fault deficits (balance beam) or improve recovery of operant performance (active avoidance test). Overall, delayed treatment with MLN519 provided significant improvement in 3 of 6 test metrics (histopathology, body weight, and neurological dysfunction) supporting improved outcome for brain-injured subjects.
