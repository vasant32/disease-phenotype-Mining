Previous results demonstrated that after 2-hour middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the rat, 1- to 2-hour recirculation temporarily restored the bioenergetic state and mitochondrial function, but secondary deterioration took place after 4 hours. The authors measured the activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, citrate synthase, and glutamate dehydrogenase as possible targets of secondary damage. Focal and penumbral tissues were sampled in the control condition, after 2 hours of MCAO, and after 1, 2, or 4 hours of postischemic recirculation; two groups were treated with alpha-phenyl-N-tert-butyl-nitrone (PBN). Complex IV activity transiently decreased after MCAO, but after recirculation all measured activities returned to control values.
