Honokiol, a constituent of Magnolia obovata, has various pharmacological effects, including protection against cerebral ischemia. However, few studies have been conducted to evaluate the possible neuroprotective effects of honokiol against cerebral ischemia. We recently reported that cerebral ischemic neuronal damage could be triggered by glucose intolerance that develops after the onset of ischemic stress (i.e., post-ischemic glucose intolerance). In addition, suppression of post-ischemic glucose intolerance significantly ameliorated ischemic neuronal damage. Here, we investigated the effects of honokiol on the development of post-ischemic glucose intolerance and neuronal damage. Mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2 h. The development of post-ischemic glucose intolerance on day 1 and neuronal damage on day 3 after MCAO were significantly reduced by intraperitoneal administration of honokiol (10 mg/kg) compared with the vehicle-treated group. Honokiol did not affect serum insulin or adiponectin levels. However, honokiol significantly decreased the expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and increased the expression of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) on day 1 after MCAO, compared with the vehicle-treated MCAO group. The results of this study suggest that honokiol could prevent post-ischemic glucose intolerance in an AMPK-dependent manner, which may be involved in the neuroprotective effects of honokiol against cerebral ischemia.
