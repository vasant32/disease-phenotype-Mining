Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) have significantly reduced infarct size in animal studies but they have not been effective in clinical trials, probably because they were administered after ischemic injury had become irreversible. The present study was designed to explore the temporal characteristics of the LMWH enoxaparin with the objective of determining the duration of the treatment window in a rat model of temporary focal ischemia. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by the intraluminal suture, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) method. Enoxaparin (10 mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously twice; the first dose was administered to different groups of animals either 1 h before or 1.5, 3, or 5 h after MCAO, and the second 4, 6, 9, or 25 h after the first dose. At 48 h animals were tested for motor coordination and brains were removed for determination of infarct size. Results showed that infarct size and degree of motor impairment were a function of time of the first and the second treatments. If the first treatment was given 1 h prior to MCAO, significant reductions in infarct size were obtained when the second treatment was given up to 6 h after the first (5 h after MCAO), but not when the second dose was given at longer intervals. If the first treatment was given 1.5 h after stroke onset, reduced infarct size was observed only in the group treated for the second time 4 h after the first injection. If the first treatment was given 3 h after MCAO, infarct size was not reduced in any group. However, if enoxaparin was administered intravenously rather than subcutaneously, significant reductions in infarct size were obtained when the first dose was given as long as 5 h after MCAO. These findings indicate that enoxaparin can reduce infarct size in rats when administered prior to stroke onset and suggest that the drug might be considered for prophylactic treatment in a phase 3 clinical trial.
