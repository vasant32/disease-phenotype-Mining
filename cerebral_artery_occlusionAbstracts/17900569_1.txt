Argininosuccinate-synthetase (ASS), argininosuccinate-lyase (ASL) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) act in the l-arginine-NO-l-citrulline cycle. In the rat brain, ASS is expressed in neurons, ASL in neurons and astroglia in the striatum, both are co-expressed with nNOS in medium-sized neurons. Microglia cells express iNOS and ASS after activation but no information is available on ASL and on ASS/ASL/iNOS co-expression in this glial population. The present aim was to ascertain, by immunohistochemistry, whether the microglia cells of the rat striatum and fronto-parietal cortex express ASL and ASS in control conditions and after transient ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion, and whether ASL and ASS are co-expressed with iNOS. The study was conducted 24, 72 and 144 h after reperfusion in two groups of ischemic rats with different tissue damage and survival. ASS and ASL are not expressed by microglia cells in controls while are present in most of the activated microglia cells in the ischemic rats. In those animals with longer survival, ASS and ASL were no more detectable at 144 h, while, in the animals with shorter survival, they were co-expressed with iNOS, but only at 72 h. In the cortex, at variance with the striatum, almost all of nNOS-positive neurons co-expressed ASS and ASL. In conclusion, only activated microglia cells express ASS and ASL, this expression precedes that of iNOS and does not necessarily imply its appearance. Therefore, local factors such as the NO produced by nNOS/ASS/ASL-positive neurons, could influence ASS/ASL-positive microglia cells avoiding or allowing the induction, in these cells, of iNOS.
