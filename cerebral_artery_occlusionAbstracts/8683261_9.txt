Leukocytes play an important role in the development of ischemia-reperfusion injury. This study was conducted to ascertain whether synthetic peptides corresponding to the cell- and heparin-binding sequences of fibronectin that disturb leukocyte adhesion molecules were effective in neuronal protection after transient focal cerebral ischemia in rats. The authors evaluated the efficacy of peptides on infarction size, leukocyte infiltration in the ischemic tissue, and neurological outcome in rats subjected to 1 hour of cerebral ischemia and 48 hours of reperfusion. Twenty-one animals were divided into three groups: transient ischemia without treatment (Group I), transient ischemia with administration of vehicle (Group II), and transient ischemia with administration of fibronectin peptides (Group III). The mean myeloperoxidase activity (U/g wet wt) in the ischemic area was as follows: Group I, 0.19% +/- 0.05; Group II, 0.21% +/- 0.03; and Group III, 0.08% +/- 0.02. The mean size of the infarction as a percentage of the total hemispheric volume was as follows: Group I, 38.35% +/- 1.34%; Group II, 39.21% +/- 2.42%; and Group III, 25.81% +/- 4.87%. Group III showed a significant decrease in myeloperoxidase activity in the lesion and the infarction size was smaller when compared to Groups I and II (p < 0.05). The neurological grade in Group III was significantly better than in Groups I and II at 48 hours after reperfusion (p < 0.01). This study is the first to explore the therapeutic potential of synthetic fibronectin peptides in brain protection after transient focal ischemia, and the results also serve as a basis for studies of important cellular and molecular events that contribute to tissue damage.
