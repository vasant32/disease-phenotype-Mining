We carried out a time course study of cerebral superoxide scavenging activity using a modified microdialysis technique. Twelve cats were divided into two groups; six were the reperfusion injury models, and six were cold injury models. In the reperfusion injury model, dialysates were collected during 60 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion and at 300 minutes during reperfusion. In the cold injury model, dialysates were collected 240 minutes after the injury. Regional cerebral blood flow on the injured side decreased during occlusion in the reperfusion injury model and 60 minutes after injury in the cold injury model. In the reperfusion model, superoxide scavenging activity, as determined with electron spin resonance, increased in the first 30 minutes and decreased 300 and 330 minutes after occlusion. In the dialysate, albumin increased 180 minutes after cold injury, which may show the progress of vasogenic edema. An increase in water content was observed on the injured side of both models, and a correlation between water content and superoxide scavenging activity was found in the reperfusion injury model. By this technique, a method of detecting the alteration of superoxide scavenging activity in the extracellular space of the brain was established.
