Transgenic mouse lines expressing the active form Akt gene under the control of the damage-induced neuronal endopeptidase (DINE) promoter were made from three different founder mice, and its neuroprotective potential against ischemic brain damage was investigated. Twenty-four hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion, two DINE-Akt-transgenic mouse lines displayed reductions of the infarcted area by 35% compared to the wild-type littermate. RT-PCR assays showed a high level of transgene in response to ischemic brain damage in these lines. These results suggest that the DINE promoter is a useful promoter, which responds to neuronal insults and that the Akt-induced neuroprotective effect against ischemic damage is potent in vivo.
