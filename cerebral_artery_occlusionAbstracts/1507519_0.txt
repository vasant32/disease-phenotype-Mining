The effects of oxiracetam on the reduction of brain metabolism induced by focal cerebral ischemia were investigated by measuring local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) in rats 24 hr after left middle cerebral artery occlusion. Focal cerebral ischemia reduced LCGU in the entire ipsilateral cortex, the greatest reduction being in the lateral parts of the frontoparietal cortex. LCGU was slightly reduced in the contralateral cortex; this reduction was considered to be caused by diaschisis. Oxiracetam was administered intraperitoneally for 3 days prior to middle cerebral artery occlusion. In the ipsilateral cortex, LCGU reduction was minimized in the ischemic center areas by oxiracetam at a dose of 400 mg/kg and in more extensive areas, by a dose of 800 mg/kg. Moreover, oxiracetam at a dose of 800 mg/kg enhanced metabolism impaired by diaschisis in the caudal areas of the contralateral cortex. These findings suggest that oxiracetam minimizes the reduction of brain function induced by ischemia and may therefore be useful in the treatment of cerebrovascular disease.
