Ischemic brain damage is believed to involve the drastic increase in extracellular glutamate levels after reperfusion and subsequent overactivation of both N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) and non-NMDAR channels for delayed neuronal cell death mediated by Ca2+ overload. In this study, we evaluated expression profiles of mRNA and corresponding proteins for different subunits of NMDAR and non-NMDAR in brains of rats with transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Cellular vitality was markedly reduced in proportion to increasing durations of MCAO for 1 to 8 h when determined 1 day after reperfusion. Within 7 days after reperfusion, MCAO for 2 h led to a gradual decrease in the neuronal marker microtubules-associated protein-2 (MAP2) level in the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere, in addition to inducing a transient increase in the microglial marker CD11b expression without affecting the astroglial marker protein levels. MCAO for 2 h significantly decreased the expression of both mRNA and corresponding proteins for NR1, NR2A and NR2B subunits of NMDAR, but not for non-NMDAR subunits, in the ipsilateral hemisphere. These results suggest that NMDAR may be preferentially down-regulated in response to ischemic signal inputs amongst three different subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptors in rats with MCAO.
