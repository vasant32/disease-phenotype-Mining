The present study concerns the vulnerability of striatal interneurons immunopositive for the Ca(2+)-binding protein calretinin to ischemic neuronal injury. An immunohistochemical study was carried out on the striata of rats which had undergone transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Two weeks after the ischemia, there was a marked reduction in the number of calretinin-positive neurons in the ipsilateral ischemic lesion, although the striatal interneurons positive for parvalbumin, which are a neuronal population distinct from the calretinin-immunoreactive cells in the striatum, were spared in the insulted areas. The present data indicate that the striatal calretinin-positive neurons are less resistant to transient ischemia, suggesting that there may exist vulnerability differences among the striatal interneurons in ischemia-induced neuronal injury.
