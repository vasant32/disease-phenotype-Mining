Forty-two stroke patients successively underwent perfusion CT (PCT)/CT angiography (CTA) and MRI examinations within 3 to 9 hours following symptom onset; 14 would have been suitable candidates for reperfusion treatment based on MRI findings. Correlation between PCT/CTA and MRI was excellent for infarct size, cortical involvement, and internal cerebral artery occlusion and substantial for penumbra/infarct ratio. Relying on MRI or PCT/CTA would have led to the same treatment decisions in all cases but one.
