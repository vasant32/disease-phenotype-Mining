Twenty-four cats had an intravenous infusion of either Fluosol or saline and then were subjected to 2 hours of middle cerebral artery occlusion. All the animals infused with Fluosol and one-half the animals infused with saline were ventilated with 100% O2. Tissue oxygen availability and regional cerebral blood flow were measured by platinum electrodes using direct voltage recordings for oxygen measurements and hydrogen clearance curves for measurements of cerebral blood flow. With 100% oxygenation tissue oxygen availability increased significantly in the Fluosol treated animals, however, during the time of ischemia oxygen availability decreased below baseline values to about an equal level whether the animals were treated with Fluosol or saline. Regional cerebral blood flow fell to a similar value in all groups during the time of occlusion. One hour after reperfusion blood flow increased considerably above baseline values in all groups and oxygen availability also increased in all groups but particularly in the Fluosol treated animals. Overall mortality and the size of infarction 1 week after the ischemic insult were not significantly different in the three groups. Mortality was directly related to the size of the infarct which, in turn, was related to the degree of ischemia during the time of occlusion.
