INTRODUCTION: To determine the contribution of tissue factor (TF) to focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, we investigated the changes in TF in rat brains with transient focal cerebral ischemia and also assessed the effect of TF pathway inhibitor (TFPI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Spontaneous hypertensive rats were subjected to 90-min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and then were reperfused for up to 24 h. Immediately after MCAO, recombinant human TFPI (rhTFPI) (50 or 20 microg/kg/min) was administered by means of a continuous intravenous injection for 4.5 h. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: TF immunoreactivity decreased or scattered in the ischemic area after reperfusion, however, an increased TF expression was observed in the microvasculature with the surrounding brain parenchyma and it peaked at 3 to 6 h, which coincided with the start of fibrin formation. On the other hand, total TF protein in ischemic area continued to exist and did not remarkably change until 24 h after reperfusion. At 24 h after reperfusion, the total infarct volume in the group treated with 50 microg/kg/min rhTFPI was significantly smaller than that in the controls (saline). Western blotting and immunohistochemical studies showed that rhTFPI treatment resulted in a decrease of fibrin in the ischemic brains and microvasculature. TF-mediated microvascular thrombosis is thus considered to contribute to focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. The continuous infusion of rhTFPI until a peak of TF-mediated microvascular thrombosis therefore attenuates the infarct volume by reducing fibrin deposition in the cerebral microcirculation.
