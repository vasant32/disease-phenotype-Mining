The mechanisms that contribute to inflammatory damage following ischemic stroke are poorly characterized, but studies indicate a role for both complement and P-selectin. In this study, we show that compared with wild-type mice, C3-deficient mice showed significant improvement in survival, neurological deficit, and infarct size at 24 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion. Furthermore, P-selectin protein expression was undetectable in the cerebral microvasculature of C3-deficient mice following reperfusion, and there was reduced neutrophil influx, reduced microthrombus formation, and increased blood flow postreperfusion in C3-deficient mice. We further investigated the use of a novel complement inhibitory protein in a therapeutic paradigm. Complement receptor 2 (CR2)-Crry inhibits complement activation at the C3 stage and targets to sites of complement activation. Treatment of normal mice with CR2-Crry at 30 min postreperfusion resulted in a similar level of protection to that seen in C3-deficient mice in all of the above-measured parameters. The data demonstrate an important role for complement in cerebrovascular thrombosis, inflammation, and injury following ischemic stroke. P-selectin expression in the cerebrovasculature, which is also implicated in cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury, was shown to be distal to and dependent on complement activation. Data also show that a CR2-targeted approach of complement inhibition provides appropriate bioavailability in cerebral injury to enable complement inhibition at a dose that does not significantly affect systemic levels of serum complement activity, a potential benefit for stroke patients where immunosuppression would be undesirable due to significantly increased susceptibility to lung infection.
