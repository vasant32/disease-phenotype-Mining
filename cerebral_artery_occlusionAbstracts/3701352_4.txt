The therapeutic potential of isovolaemic haemodilution and osmotherapy on the sequelae of middle cerebral artery occlusion has been studied in an animal model. The territory of the middle cerebral artery that failed to fill with a carbon black intravascular marker after intracranial occlusion for 30 minutes in the anaesthetised rat was reduced by 50% by isovolaemic haemodilution to a haematocrit of 30%. An intravenous infusion of 10% glycerol prevented swelling of the ischaemic hemisphere, though it did not further improve vascular perfusion. These findings support the use of isovolaemic haemodilution and osmotherapy in the acute aftermath of stroke.
