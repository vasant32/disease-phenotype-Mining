We describe a new test of vibrissae-elicited forelimb placing ability that allows testing of sensorimotor integration across the midline. Rats were given unilateral brain lesions using one of three methods: (1) middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) causing significant damage to the cortex and striatum, (2) aspiration lesions to remove tissue from the sensorimotor cortex, and (3) infusions of the catecholamine neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the medial forebrain bundle, producing a parkinsonian syndrome. Application of the new test to these animals revealed that with some lesion types, the ability of vibrissae on the unimpaired side of the body to trigger placing in the functionally impaired forelimb recovers before vibrissae on the impaired side can elicit placing. This occurs despite the lack of any apparent vibrissae sensory deficit, since the contralesional vibrissae maintained the ability to trigger placing in the unimpaired forelimb in all lesions studied. Chronically, MCAo-lesioned rats do not place the impaired forelimb upon stimulation of the impaired-side vibrissae, but do place if the vibrissae on the good side are stimulated (i.e., when the placing is triggered "across the midline"). This is in contrast to 6-OHDA-lesioned rats which, consistent with parkinsonian akinesia, cannot place the impaired limb regardless of sensory trigger. Also, differences in the pattern of recovery between MCAo- and aspiration-lesioned rats suggest a possible anatomical substrate for cross-midline placing ability and its recovery. Unlike other tests, cross-midline placing methods can readily distinguish between severe stroke and severe parkinsonism in rats.
