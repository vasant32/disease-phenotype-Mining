Five consecutive patients with acute neurological deficits after middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion were given emergency treatment with colloidal volume expansion. In each case, the diagnosis was confirmed promptly by computed tomography and cerebral angiography. Aggressive volume expansion therapy was started 2 to 18 hours (mean, 11 hr) after the onset of the neurological deficit. The mean colloidal volume used was 920 ml/day for an average of 4 days. During volume expansion, the mean cardiac output increased 57% from 4.6 +/- 0.6 to 7.2 +/- 1.9 litres/min (P less than 0.05). The mean hematocrit decreased 19% from 46 +/- 3% to 37 +/- 4% (P less than 0.01). The mean arterial blood pressure remained stable, and the pulmonary artery wedge pressure was maintained at less than 15 mm Hg. Three patients improved dramatically with volume expansion therapy and have returned to their previous life-styles. Two patients made partial recoveries and manage at home with nursing care. The three patients who improved dramatically were young (aged less than 34) and, when compared to the older patients, they had greater increases in cardiac output (67% vs. 19%). No major complications or deaths were attributed to the volume expansion therapy. We propose that intravascular volume expansion and its concomitant augmentation of the cardiovascular dynamics may be effective in the treatment of acute neurological deficits after acute MCA occlusion.
