Previous studies have demonstrated that newborn striatal neurons can functionally integrate with local neural networks in adult rat brain after injury. In the present study, we determined whether these newly generated striatal neurons can develop projections to the substantia nigra, a target of striatal projection neurons. We used 5'-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and a retroviral vector expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) combined with multiple immunostaining labels of newborn striatal neurons, and nigral microinjection of fluorogold (FG) to trace the striatonigral projection in adult rat brain at different weeks following a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). We found that FG positive (FG(+)) cells could be detected in newly generated neurons (BrdU(+)-NeuN(+) and GFP(+)-NeuN(+)) in ipsilateral striatum clearly at 12, but not 2 weeks after MCAO. The data suggest that ischemia-induced newborn striatal projection neurons could form long axons that targeted the substantia nigra (striatonigral projection pathway) and that have intact axonal transport from the nerve terminal to cell body. These new striatal neurons express glutamate NR2 and dopamine D2L receptors, which form the molecular basis for responding to the inputs from cortical glutamatergic and nigral dopaminergic projection neurons. Our data provide the first morphological evidence that newborn neurons in the striatum, a non-neurogenic region, can establish new striatonigral neural circuits, important pathways for the maintenance of motor function. These results help us to understand endogenous cellular mechanisms of brain repair, and suggest that increasing adult neurogenesis could be a practical strategy for enhancing the efficacy of rehabilitative therapy in stroke patients.
