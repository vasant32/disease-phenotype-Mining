Following focal cerebral ischemia, neuronal cell death is detected in remote areas of the brain, including the ipsilateral thalamus and substantia nigra (SN), as well as in the ischemic core. We have investigated protein synthesis in the remote areas of rats exposed to focal ischemia using autoradiography. The proximal portion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) was permanently occluded, and at various periods (6 h, 2, 4 and 7 days and 2 and 4 weeks following ischemia) animals received a single dose of L-[2,3-3H]valine (6.7 mCi/kg). Brain sections containing the thalamus and SN were processed for autoradiography. In the ipsilateral cerebral cortex and striatum, marked impairment of protein synthesis was observed and was never completely recovered during the experiment. No changes in protein synthesis in the ipsilateral thalamus were detected during the experiment. However, a change in protein synthesis was demonstrated in the ipsilateral SN. At 2 days after MCA occlusion, incorporation of [3H]valine into the whole zona reticulata of the ipsilateral SN was slightly enhanced and the increase became evident at 4 days after ischemia. Increased incorporation of [3H]valine began to be localized in the lateral portion of the zona reticulata after 7 days and continued up to 4 weeks following ischemia. Enhanced protein synthesis during the early stage (2 and 4 days after ischemia) may be due to the activated function of the neurons in the zona reticulata and that during the late stage (7 days and 2 and 4 weeks) after ischemia to astroglial proliferation
