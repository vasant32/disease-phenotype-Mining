OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed at examining whether hypothermia is neuroprotective against permanent cerebral ischemia in rats. METHODS: A total of 32 male Sprague--Dawley rats were subjected to a middle cerebral artery occlusion. In the hypothermic group, rats (n=10) underwent selective brain hypothermia for 5 hours with the use of a novel surface coil with coolant circulating inside. In the control (n=13) and sham groups (n=9), the rats were maintained at normothermia. After a period of 168 hours ischemia, animals were killed to measure the infarction volume of the brain stained with hematoxylin-eosin. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in physiological parameters except for the temperature. The present style of hypothermia significantly reduced infarction volume in the cortex and caudoputamen. DISCUSSION: The present results endorse the neuroprotective effect of our method of hypothermia in permanent focal cerebral ischemia at an endpoint of 1 week under the following two conditions: (1) reduction of muscle and caudoputamen temperature to 29 and 31 degrees C, respectively; (2) maintenance of the mean arterial blood pressure above 90 mmHg during hypothermia.
