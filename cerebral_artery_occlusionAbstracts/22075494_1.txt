 AIMS: The role of nitric oxide (NO) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) injury and diabetes. The aim of the study was to investigate the neuroprotective potential of 3-bromo-7-nitroindazole (3-BNI), a potent and selective neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) inhibitor against ER stress and focal cerebral I/R injury associated with comorbid type 2 diabetes in-vivo. MAIN METHODS: Type 2 diabetes was induced by feeding high-fat diet and streptozotocin (35 mg/kg) treatment in rats. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by 2h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by 22 h of reperfusion. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting methods were employed for the detection and expression of ER stress/apoptosis markers [78 kDa glucose regulated protein (GRP78) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP)]. TUNEL assay for DNA fragmentation was also performed. KEY FINDINGS: The diabetic rats subjected to cerebral I/R had prominent neurological damage and functional deficits compared with sham-operated rats. Massive DNA fragmentation was observed in ischemic penumbral region of diabetic brains. Concomitantly, the enhanced immunoreactivity and expression of ER stress/apoptosis markers were noticed. 3-BNI (30 mg/kg, i.p.) treatment significantly inhibited the cerebral infarct, edema volume and improved functional recovery of neurological deficits. The neuroprotection was further evident by lesser DNA fragmentation with a concomitant reduction of GRP78 and CHOP. SIGNIFICANCE: The study demonstrates the neuroprotective potential of 3-BNI in diabetic stroke model which may be partly due to inhibition of ER stress pathway involving CHOP.
