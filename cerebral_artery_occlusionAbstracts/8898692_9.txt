Myo-inositol is one of the major organic osmolytes in the brain. It is accumulated into cells through an Na+/ myo-inositol cotransporter (SMIT) that is regulated by extracellular tonicity. To investigate the role of SMIT in the brain after cerebral ischemia, we examined expression of SMIT mRNA in the rat brain after middle cerebral artery occlusion, which would reflect alteration of extracellular tonicity. The expression of SMIT mRNA was markedly increased 12 h after surgery in the cortex of the affected side and lasted until the second day. Increased expression was also found in the contralateral cingulate cortex. Up-regulated expression was found predominantly in the neurons in remote areas, although nonneuronal cells adjacent to the ischemic core also expressed this mRNA. These results suggest that cerebral ischemia causes extensive osmotic stress in brain and that the neuronal cells respond to this stress by increasing SMIT expression.
