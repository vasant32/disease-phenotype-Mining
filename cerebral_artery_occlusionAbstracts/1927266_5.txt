The distribution patterns of ionic Lanthanum (La3+; mol. wt. 139) were evaluated after 15, 30 and 60 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion in perfused-fixed rats. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability to Evans blue (EB) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP; mol. wt. 40,000) in vivo was also evaluated. Brain tissue specific gravity was measured. An increase in brain water content was found as early as 30 min following occlusion. HRP and EB extravasation was not observed. La3+ crossed the interendothelial clefts of venules and capillaries at 30 and 60 min and was seen in both extracellular and intracellular brain compartments at 60 min. La3+ extravasation was seen in nonedematous areas bordering the regions of water accumulation. Our findings suggest that the early phase of incomplete continuous ischemia is accompanied by changes in BBB permeability and the interendothelial clefts of venules and capillaries seem to represent one of the early sites of ischemic damage.
