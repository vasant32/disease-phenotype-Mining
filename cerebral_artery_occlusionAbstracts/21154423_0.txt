Treatment with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) ameliorates neurological functional deficits after stroke. Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a neurotrophic factor that supports the survival and growth of neural cells. Noggin, an antagonist of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), promotes the differentiation of stem cells into neurons. In this study, we hypothesize that transfection of NGF and Noggin in BMSC treatment of stroke promotes BMSC neuronal differentiation and improves functional outcome after stroke. Adenovirus was used to trasfect NGF and Noggin and the transfection efficiency was measured by Western blot and immunostaining in vitro. The transfected BMSCs with NGF and/or Noggin were administered intravenously at 5 days after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) in rats. The neurological functional outcome and BMSC migration and differentiation in the ischemic brain were measured. The transplantation of BMSCs with NGF or Noggin elicited neurological functional improvement, promoted BMSCs present in the ischemic brain, and also up-regulated neuro-like cell differentiation as well as increased synaptophysin expression in the ischemic brain compared with nontreatment control animals (P< 0.05). Treatment of stroke with a combination of transfection of NGF and Noggin in BMSCs induced a synergistic effect on improved neurological functional outcome, BMSCs present in the ischemic brain, and synaptophysin expression in the ischemic brain compared with BMSCs transfected with an NGF- or Noggin-alone group (P < 0.05). These data demonstrate that increasing NGF or Noggin expression in BMSCs contributes to brain plasticity after stroke and that a synergistic effect is induced on the coexistence of NGF and Noggin in BMSCs treatment of stroke.
