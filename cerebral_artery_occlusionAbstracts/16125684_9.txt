To investigate the effect of 17beta-estradiol (E2) on ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in diabetic ovariectomized female rats. Streptozotocin(STZ)-induced diabetic female rats received E2 treatment for 2 weeks after ovariectomy (OVX). A period of 90 min of temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) was used for the study. Rats were evaluated for physiological data including plasma glucose, E2, MAP, PaCO2 and PaO2 before and after tMCAO. P-selectin expression, myeloperoxidase (MPO) enzyme activity and the cerebral infarct volume were analyzed. RESULTS: The infarct volume in the E2-treated OVX rats is bigger than that in intact and OVX groups. However, there is not a significant different area of cerebral infarct between diabetic OVX and intact rats. Significant upregulation of P-selectin expression and MPO activity of the ischemia-reperfusion hemisphere were observed in E2 + OVX, intact and OVX groups at 8, 24, 72 h in time manner after tMCAO compared with that of the contralateral hemisphere of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. Both P-selectin expression and MPO activity in the E2 + OVX and intact rats are significantly higher than that in the untreated OVX rats. Chronic estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) potentiates the I/R injury in diabetes female rats. This may be related to the increased expression of P-selectin and MPO activity.
