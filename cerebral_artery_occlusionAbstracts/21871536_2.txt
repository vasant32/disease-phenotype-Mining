Stachybotrys microspora triprenyl phenol-7 (SMTP-7) is a novel fibrinolytic agent with anti-inflammatory effect. Previous study demonstrated that SMTP-7 further ameliorated infarction volume in a mouse embolic stroke model compared with tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA), but the reason SMTP-7 has more beneficial effect than tPA has not yet been determined. In the present study, we investigated whether SMTP-7 has an intrinsic neuroprotective effect against transient focal cerebral ischemia (tFCI). Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to tFCI by intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion for 2h. Following induction of tFCI, rats were randomized into two groups based on the agent administered: SMTP-7 group and vehicle group. We examined cerebral infarction volume 24h after reperfusion, and evaluated superoxide production, the expressions of nitrotyrosine and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), which play major roles in secondary brain injury and hemorrhagic transformation. The findings showed that SMTP-7 significantly suppressed superoxide production, the expression of nitrotyrosine and MMP-9 after tFCI, and consequently attenuated ischemic neuronal damage. These results suggest that SMTP-7 has an intrinsic neuroprotective effect on ischemia/reperfusion injury through the suppression of oxidative stress and MMP-9 activation.
