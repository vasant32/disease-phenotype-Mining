OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of electro-acupuncturing DU26 (Renzhong) on cortical excitability and neurofunction after focal cerebral ischemia injury. METHOD: 30 male Wistar rats were divided randomly into control group, MCAo group and MCAo+DU26ES group, 10 in each group. Middle Cerebral Artery occlusion models (MCAo) were created in accordance with Zea Longa method and modified method. DC continuous square-wave electric pulse stimuli (2Hz, 3mA) which was given between DU26 and non-acupoint area in the left shoulder, was applied to MCAo+DU26ES group 10 minutes every time, twice a day, while the control group and MCAo group received no treatment. 3 days later transcranial electrical stimulation motor evoked potential (MEP) was recorded, the onset latency and peak-to-peak amplitude were analyzed and the neurological deficits were evaluated. The effects of electro-acupuncturing DU26 (Renzhong) and MCAo injury on these parameters were analyzed. RESULTS: Given the isointensity suprathreshold stimulus, the latency on the affected side in MCAo group was significantly longer than that in control group (P<0.05), the amplitudes on both sides were significantly reduced (P<0.05, P<0.05); the latencies on both sides in MCAo+DU26ES group tended to become shorter and the amplitudes on both sides tended to increase compared with MCAo group; there were no significant differences on latency and amplitude between the healthy side and the affected side in all groups (P>0.05). The neuro-scores of rats receiving electro-acupuncturing DU26 (Renzhong) were significantly higher than those in MCAo group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Electro-acupuncturing DU26 (Renzhong) can improve the motor cortical excitability, and facilitate the motor function recovery after MCAo injury.
