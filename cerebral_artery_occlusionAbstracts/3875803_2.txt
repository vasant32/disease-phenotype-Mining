Three rare cases of moyamoya-like diseases with moyamoya type vessels caused by spontaneous internal carotid artery occlusion, spontaneous middle cerebral artery occlusion, and internal carotid artery occlusion due to cervical irradiation are presented. They resulted in ventricular hemorrhages. One patient died and two survived. Postoperatively, the collateral circulation of the survivors was evaluated by single photon emission tomography using N-isopropyl-[123I]-p-iodoamphetamine. The effectiveness of reconstructive surgery is shown, and moyamoya-like diseases that have been reported are reviewed.
