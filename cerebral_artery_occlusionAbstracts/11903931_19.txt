Electroencephalography (EEG) has a long history in clinical evaluations of cerebrovascular disease. Distinct EEG abnormalities, such as increased slow delta activity, voltage depression and epileptiform discharge, have been identified in stroke patients. However, preclinical use of EEG analysis of cerebral ischaemia is less documented. We report a new rat model of EEG topographic mapping during permanent and transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Ten EEG electrodes were implanted on the rat skull, symmetrically covering the cortical regions of two hemispheres. Monopolar EEG recordings were acquired from each animal at multiple time points during the initial 24 h, and again once daily for 7 days. Traditional EEG examinations, quantitative EEG (qEEG) spectral analysis and topographic EEG mapping were employed for comprehensive data analyses. Several distinct spatiotemporal EEG abnormalities were identified in the ischaemic rat brain. In the ipsilateral hemisphere, pronounced increase in delta activity was observed in each recorded area within 24 h of injury. While sharp waves and spike complexes dominated the parietal region, a nearly isoelectric EEG state was seen in the temporal region. After 48 h, spontaneous, albeit incomplete, recovery of EEG activities developed in all rats. Reperfusion appeared to promote delta and alpha recovery more efficiently. The contralateral EEG changes were also recorded in two phases: an acute moderate increase in delta activities with intermittent rhythmic activities, followed by a delayed and significant increase in beta activities across the hemisphere. The similarities of rat qEEG profiles identified in this study to that of stroke patients and the application of topographic mapping broaden our research technology for preclinical experimental studies of brain injury.
