Nicotinamide protects cortical neuronal cells against cerebral ischemic injury through activation of various cytoprotective mechanisms. Here, this study confirmed the neuroprotective effects of nicotinamide in focal cerebral ischemic injury and investigated whether nicotinamide modulates a crucial survival pathway, Akt and its downstream targets. Adult male rats were treated with vehicle or nicotinamide (500 mg/kg) 2h after the onset of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Brains were collected 24h after MCAO and infarct volumes were analyzed. Nicotinamide significantly reduced the infarct volume in the cerebral cortex. Potential activation was measured by phosphorylation of PDK1 at Ser(241), Akt at Ser(473), and Bad at Ser(136) using Western blot analysis. Nicotinamide prevented the injury-induced decrease of pPDK1, pAkt, and pBad levels. 14-3-3 levels were not different between vehicle- and nicotinamide-treated animals. However, pBad and 14-3-3 interaction levels decreased during MCAO, but were maintained in the presence of nicotinamide, compared to levels in control animals. These findings suggest that nicotinamide attenuates cell death due to focal cerebral ischemic injury and that neuroprotective effects are mediated through the Akt signaling pathway, thus enhancing neuronal survival.
