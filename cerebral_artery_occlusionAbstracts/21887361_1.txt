 BACKGROUND: Memory impairment is a frequent complication of brain ischemia. Neurogenesis is implicated in learning and memory and is regulated by the transcription factor c-Fos. Preconditioning intermittent hypoxia (IH) attenuates ischemia-related memory impairments, but it is not known whether post-ischemia IH intervention has a similar effect. We investigated the effects of post-ischemia IH on hippocampal neurogenesis and c-Fos expression as well as spatial learning and memory in rats. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Focal cerebral ischemia was induced in some rats by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), while other rats received sham MCAO surgery. Beginning a week later, half of the rats of each group received IH interventions (12% oxygen concentration, 4 hrs/d, for 7 d) and half received sham IH sessions. An additional group of rats received MCAO, IH, and injections of the neurogenesis-impairing agent 3'-AZT. Spatial learning and memory was measured in the Morris water maze, and hippocampal neurogenesis and c-Fos expression were examined. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (pMAPK) were considered as possible mediators of IH-induced changes in neurogenesis and c-Fos expression. IH intervention following MCAO resulted in recovered spatial memory, increased hippocampal neurogenesis, and increased expression of c-Fos in newborn hippocampal cells. These effects were blocked by 3'-AZT. IH intervention following MCAO also was associated with increased hippocampal pMAPK and HIF-1α expression. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: IH intervention following MCAO rescued ischemia-induced spatial learning and memory impairments, likely by inducing hippocampal neurogenesis and c-Fos expression through mediators including pMAPK and HIF-1α.
