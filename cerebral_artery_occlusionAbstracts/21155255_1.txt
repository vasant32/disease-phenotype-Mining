 AIM: To investigate the effects of Angelica sinensis on the expression of Flt-1, Flk-1 mRNA after the ischemic brain injury in rats. METHODS: Wistar rats randomly divided into two groups: group A rats underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2 hours by suture, group B rats underwent MCAO for 2 hours meanwhile received treatment with Angelica sinensis (5g/kg). At 1 st d, 3 rd d and 7 th d after reperfusion, 36 rats( n = 18 in each group) were assessed by neurological scale and brain tissue was taken to assess the lesion ration with 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. The other rats (n = 3 at different time points in each group) were decapitated at 3 h, 6 h, 12 h , 1 st d, 3 rd d, 7 th d after reperfusion. Quantitative reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique was used to examine the gene expression of Flt-1, Flk-1. RESULTS: The neurologic deficit score of rats in group B decreased significantly compared with group A at the same time point (P < 0.05). The infarct volume of group A was significant greater than group B at the same time point after reperfusion (P < 0.01). The results of RT-PCR revealed that the gene expression of Flt-1, Flk-1 in the two groups increased from 3 h after reperfusion and reached its peak at the time of 3 rd d after reperfusion, then declined gradually. The gene expression of Flt-1, Flk-1 in the group B was significantly increased than group A at the same time point (P < 0.01). The gene expression of Flk-1 was positive correlated with Flt-1 in two groups (r = 0.957). CONCLUSION: The increasing amount of Flt-1, Flk-1 expression was enhanced by Angelica sinensis following transient interruption of cerebral blood flow in rats.
