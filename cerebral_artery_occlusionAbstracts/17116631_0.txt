OBJECTIVE: The authors used computed tomography (CT) to assess and categorize the topography of ischemic strokes (IS) among blacks living in Abidjan, the commercial and administrative center of CÃ´te d'Ivoire, in West Africa. METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed CT data of patients admitted to the Sainte Anne Marie Polyclinic (the principal private hospital in the country) and to the neurology department of the university hospital center in Cocody, from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2001. The study included patients who met World Health Organisation criteria for stroke and had CT performed during the hospitalization for this stroke. We examined CT data to find early and late signs of IS, analyze lesion diameter (15 mm cutoff used to distinguish infarcts from lacuna), and determine their topography (cerebral arterial territory and localization, that is, brain lobes, basal ganglia and posterior cerebral fossa). RESULTS: We included 260 subjects (58% males) with a median age of 45 years (range: 20-80 years). CT findings were abnormal for 224 patients with infarcts (72.7%), lacuna (27.3%), or both (8%). As reported elsewhere, the anterior arterial territory was most often affected (83.9%) with a middle cerebral artery lesion in 79.4% of patients. Posterior territory (16.1%) lesions and lacuna were probably underestimated because CT exploration is reported to be less useful for this area than for the carotid area. On the other hand, CT diagnoses infarcts more easily than it does lacuna. CT was normal for 36 patients although performed no more than 3 days after IS. These patients did not undergo CT angiography, which might have shown cerebral artery occlusion. CONCLUSION: Our study included IS of all types and typography. Stroke registries in Africa would provide useful data for better assessment of prevalence for specific topographic and etiologic types of stroke.
