Lanthionines are novel neurotrophic and neuroprotective small molecules that show promise for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, a recently developed, cell permeable lanthionine derivative known as LKE (lanthionine ketimine 5-ethyl ester) promotes neurite growth at low nanomolar concentrations. LKE also has neuroprotective, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Its therapeutic potential in cerebral ischemia and its mechanisms of neurotrophic action remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we hypothesize that the neuroprotective actions of LKE could result from induction or modulation of CRMP2. We found that treating primary cultured mouse neurons with LKE provided significant protection against t-butyl hydroperoxide-induced neuronal death possibly through CRMP2 upregulation. Similarly, in vivo studies showed that LKE pre and/or post-treatment protects mice against permanent distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (p-MCAO) as evidenced by lower stroke lesions and improved functional outcomes in terms of rotarod, grip strength and neurologic deficit scores in treated groups. Protein expression levels of CRMP2 were higher in brain cortices of LKE pretreated mice, suggesting that LKE's neuroprotective activity may be CRMP2 dependent. Lower activity of cleaved PARP-1 and higher activity of SIRT-1 was also observed in LKE treated group suggesting its anti-apoptotic properties. Our results suggest that LKE has potential as a therapeutic intervention in cerebral ischemia and that part of its protective mechanism may be attributed to CRMP2 mediated action and PARP-1/SIRT-1 modulation.
