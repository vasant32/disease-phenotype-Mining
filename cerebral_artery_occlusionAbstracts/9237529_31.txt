Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is transported by fast anterograde axonal transport. Since disruption of this transport results in APP accumulation, APP has been proposed as a sensitive marker of axonal injury. In the present study, axonal injury in subcortical white matter and myelinated fibre tracts permeating the striatum, 24 h after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat, has been examined by assessing the location and extent of APP immunoreactivity. Increased APP immunoreactivity was present in both areas. This was localised to a circumscribed zone immediately adjacent to the boundary of the ischaemic lesion in grey matter. The amount of APP immunoreactivity was associated with the volume of the ischaemic lesion in individual animals. Increased APP immunoreactivity in subcortical white matter and myelinated fibre tracts at the margin of the ischaemic zone may prove to be a valuable marker for assessing strategies to protect axons after an ischaemic insult.
