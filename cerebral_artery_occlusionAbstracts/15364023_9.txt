Delayed neuronal death (DND) of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus has been extensively studied following global brain ischemia, whereas only little is known about DND in this highly vulnerable brain region after focal brain ischemia. In the present study, the distribution and time course of hippocampal neuronal apoptosis were studied following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats 1, 3, 7, 14, and 30 days after the insult. In 60% of the animals, more than 90% of CA1 pyramidal neurons showed strong nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining at day 3 with fragmentation and marginalization of the nuclei in approximately 40% of these cells. The number of TUNEL-positive cells decreased within the next days, but 30 days after MCAO, some apoptotic neurons were still present. Analysis of the expression of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and its receptors GFRalpha1, GFRalpha2, and GFRalpha3 using triple immunofluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that in all animals showing marked hippocampal DND, the neuronal staining for GFRalpha1, GFRalpha3, and GDNF decreased prior to the onset of TUNEL staining in CA1. After 7 days, some apoptotic neurons still expressed GFRalpha3, whereas only few showed GFRalpha1 immunoreactivity, indicating that GFRalpha1 may be beneficial for the survival of hippocampal neurons. The data suggest that reduced expression of GDNF and impairment of GFRalpha1/3 may contribute to hippocampal DND after focal brain ischemia.
