The effect of PGE(2) EP3 receptors on injury size was investigated following cerebral ischemia and induced excitotoxicity in mice. Treatment with the selective EP3 agonist ONO-AE-248 significantly and dose-dependently increased infarct size in the middle cerebral artery occlusion model. In a separate experiment, pretreatment with ONO-AE-248 exacerbated the lesion caused by N-methyl-d-aspartic acid-induced acute excitotoxicity. Conversely, genetic deletion of EP3 provided protection against N-methyl-d-aspartic acid-induced toxicity. The results suggest that PGE(2), by stimulating EP3 receptors, can contribute to the toxicity associated with cyclooxygenase and that antagonizing this receptor could be used therapeutically to protect against stroke- and excitotoxicity-induced brain damage.
