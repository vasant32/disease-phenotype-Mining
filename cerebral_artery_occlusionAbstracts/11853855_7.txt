The poor quality of life after a stroke is largely attributed to deficits in cognitive-motor functioning. The goals of this study were to detect if damaged motor learning function were attributed to motor deficits in rats following a transient middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. Stroke was induced by a 2-h occlusion of the MCA using an intraluminal filament. Motor functions were evaluated from 5 up to 28 days after reperfusion in ischemic and control rats. Motor function was detected by a series of motor tests (runway traversing and beam balancing, as well as foot fault placing, parallel bar crossing, rope and ladder climbing), and motor learning behavior was determined by analyzing the rate of improvement of impaired function during performance of the motor tasks. Significant (P<0.001) motor deficits were detected in the stroke group (n=10) while performing motor tasks that involve extensive coordination, in comparison to the controls (n=12). Although motor behavior was improved with repeated behavior testing, unparalleled rate of improvement of motor performance on rope and ladder climbing tests was found between the two groups, suggesting an impaired motor learning function. Brain tissue damage was detected in the ischemic animals 28 days after surgery, demonstrated by 40% infarct volume of contralateral hemisphere. Both motor learning and motor function were impaired in ischemic rats. The motor tests used in this study are sensitive, semi-quantitative, and reproducible measurements of functional impairment in rats following an ischemic stroke.
