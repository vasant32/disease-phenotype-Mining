Apoptotic neuronal cell death has recently been associated with the development of infarction after cerebral ischemia. In a variety of studies, CuZn-superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) has been shown to protect the brain from ischemic injury. A possible role for CuZn-SOD-related modulation of neuronal viability is suggested by the finding that CuZn-SOD inhibits apoptotic neuronal cell death in response to some forms of cellular damage. We evaluated this possibility in the model of transient focal cerebral ischemia in mice bearing a disruption of the CuZn-SOD gene (Sod1). Homozygous mutant (Sod1 -/-) mice had no detectable CuZn-SOD activity, and heterozygous mutants (Sod1 +/-) showed a 50% decrease compared with wild-type mice. Sod1 -/- mice showed a high level of blood-brain barrier disruption soon after 1 hr of middle cerebral artery occlusion and 100% mortality at 24 hr after ischemia. Sod1 +/- mice showed 30% mortality at 24 hr after ischemia, and neurological deficits were exacerbated compared with wild-type controls. The Sod1 +/- animals also had increased infarct volume and brain swelling, accompanied by increased apoptotic neuronal cell death as indicated by the in situ nick-end labeling technique to detect DNA fragmentation and morphological criteria. These results suggest that oxygen-free radicals, especially superoxide anions, are an important factor for the development of infarction by brain edema formation and apoptotic neuronal cell death after focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion.
