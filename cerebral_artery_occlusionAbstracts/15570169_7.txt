Male Wistar rats were treated with an angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist, candesartan cilexetil (TCV-116, 1 mg/kg/day) over a 4-week period. Systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced by 14% after 1 week and remained stable for the next 3 weeks compared with controls. Up-regulation of AT2, but not AT1, receptor gene expression by 3.4-fold and 5.0-fold was observed 1 and 4 weeks after treatment. Middle cerebral artery occlusion caused significantly reduced infarct volumes in TCV-116-treated rats, by about 30% when compared with control rats. Neurological scores were also improved in treated rats. These results suggest that the neuroprotective effects of TCV-116 may be mediated through AT1 receptor antagonism and AT2 receptor up-regulation.
