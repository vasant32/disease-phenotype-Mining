The role of brain insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) in neuroprotection was further investigated using in vitro and in vivo models of cerebral ischemia by assessing the effects of IGF-I, IGF-II, and high affinity IGFBP ligand inhibitors (the peptide [Leu24, 59, 60, Ala31]hIGF-I (IGFBP-LI) and the small molecule NBI-31772 (1-(3,4-dihydroxybenzoyl)-3-hydroxycarbonyl-6, 7-dihydroxyisoquinoline), which pharmacologically displace and elevate endogenous, bioactive IGFs from IGFBPs. Treatment with IGF-I, IGF-II, or IGFBP-LI (2 microg/mL) significantly (P < 0.05) reduced CA1 damage in organotypic hippocampal cultures resulting from 35 minutes of oxygen and glucose deprivation by 71%, 60%, and 40%, respectively. In the subtemporal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of focal ischemia, intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of IGF-I and IGF-II at the time of artery occlusion reduced ischemic brain damage in a dose-dependent manner, with maximum reductions in total infarct size of 37% (P < 0.01) and 38% (P < 0.01), respectively. In this model of MCAO, i.c.v. administration of NBI-31772 at the time of ischemia onset also dose-dependently reduced infarct size, and the highest dose (100 microg) significantly reduced both total (by 40%, P < 0.01) and cortical (by 43%, P < 0.05) infarct volume. In the intraluminal suture MCAO model, administration of NBI-31772 (50 microg i.c.v.) at the time of artery occlusion reduced both cortical infarct volume (by 40%, P < 0.01) and brain swelling (by 24%, P < 0.05), and it was still effective when treatment was delayed up to 3 hours after the induction of ischemia. These results further define the neuroprotective properties of IGFs and IGFBP ligand inhibitors in experimental models of cerebral ischemia.
