Cerebral ischemic stroke is a prevalent disease in senior individuals. The anticoagulation and thrombolysis to recover blood supply as well as the diminution of neural excitotoxicity to protect brain cells have not shown to fully improve stroke patients. The comprehensive mechanisms and medication specificity remain to be addressed. The silence of specific mRNAs by RNA interference provides revenues for such goals. We examined whether the silence of protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) by siRNA protects brain tissues from ischemic injury. In three groups of Wistar rats, their lateral ventricles received the injections of lentiviral vectors carrying siRNA for PAR1, small RNA in mismatching PAR1 or saline. A week after the injections, these rats were treated by one side of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The scores of neurological deficits, the volume of ischemic infarction and the expressions of PAR-1, HSP-70 and MAP-2 were measured in 24h of MCAO. Our results show that the silence of PAR-1 significantly reduces neurological deficits and infarction volume, as well as elevates HSP-70 and MAP-2 expressions. Thus, the knock-down of PAR1 minimizes the ischemic impairments of cerebral cortex via HSP70 and MAP-2 pathways.
