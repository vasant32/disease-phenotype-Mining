OBJECTIVE: To study the interfering effect of neuregulin-1beta (NRG-1beta) on the cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury in monkeys. METHODS: The models with middle cerebral artery occlusion reperfusion (MCAO/R) were established by inserting a micro-balloon catheter intra-arterially into MCA from femoral artery in 12 adult healthy monkeys. The NRG-1beta was injected into MCA from micro-balloon catheter in the animals of treatment group at 2 h post-ischemia while the normal saline was simultaneously injected in the animals of control group. Then the micro-balloon catheter was withdrawn from the MCA to perfuse for 22 h. The nervous behavioral function was evaluated by task-oriented score and the infarct volume measured by TTC and MRI. RESULTS: The animals of control group had an onset of nervous functional disorders at 2 h post-ischemia and had no significant difference at reperfusion 22 h (59.8 +/- 15.7); the nervous function of monkeys had no improvement after NFG-1beta treatment (61.3 +/- 16.2) (P > 0.05). The diffuse weight imaging (DWI) showed a high signal area but T(1) and T(2) imaging had no significant changes at 2 h post-ischemia in control group animals; while the T(1) and T(2) imaging showed a typical high signal areas, DWI high signal area expanded and TTC staining ischemic area appeared at reperfusion 22 h. The T(1), T(2) and DWI abnormal signal areas and TTC cerebral infarct volume did not shrink significantly in NFG-1beta treatment group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The neuroprotective effects of NRG-1beta upon cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury needs to be further studied.
