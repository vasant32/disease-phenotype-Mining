Synthesis of nitrone derivatives of trolox is described. Their biological evaluation was performed in vitro for scavenging different free radicals, inhibiting Fe(2+)-induced lipid peroxidation, and in vivo in a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion model in mice. New compounds exert pharmacological activities comparable to or better than those of trolox or nitrone-type reference compounds.
