Seven patients were treated with brain hypothermia following acute major cerebral artery occlusion to utilize the suppressive effect against brain swelling. Five patients had internal carotid and two had proximal middle cerebral artery occlusion. Except for the first two cases, hypothermia was introduced early and the temperature reached 35.0 degrees C within 6 hours after the onset. The core temperature finally stabilized between 32 degrees C to 34 degrees C. Hypothermia had a suppressive effect against brain swelling and the temperature showed a significant correlation to intracranial pressure. Recurrence of brain swelling was observed during the rewarming process, but two patients became independent and three patients were moderately disabled in wheelchairs. Only two patients died. Brain hypothermia is an effective treatment for acute major cerebral artery occlusion through the relief of brain swelling. The overall outcome may be improved by combining brain hypothermia with other conventional therapies such as osmotherapy and external decompression implemented with an extended period of rewarming.
