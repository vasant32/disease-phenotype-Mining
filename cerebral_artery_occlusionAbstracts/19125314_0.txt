We report a case of ischemic stroke in a 43 year-old woman with no traditional cardiovascular risk factors and a history of cranial surgery and cranial radiation therapy (CRT) for a GH-secreting pituitary macroadenoma. The neurological work-up on this patient disclosed several cerebral ischemic lesions and demonstrated the occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery together with the narrowing of the right carotid artery; post-radiation brain damage was also visible by nuclear magnetic resonance. We postulate the existence in this patient of a radiation-induced vascular damage, which is a well recognized process thoroughly described in in vitro studies. We remark that life-long follow-up of acromegalic patients receiving CRT is essential so that early diagnosis of radiation-induced vascular injury can be made.
