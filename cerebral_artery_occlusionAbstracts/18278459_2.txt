The change of the expression of Cyclins in neurons of rats after focal cerebral ischemia was investigated. Ischemia was induced by temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The experimental rats induced by MCAO were sacrificed on 7th and 14th day after reperfusion. The brain was taken out at 7th and 14th day after injury, and the expression of Cyclin D1, E, A and B1 in neurons of cerebral cortex or hippocampal CA1 region was detected by immunofluorescence and confocal microscope. The results showed that after MCAO, in the ipsilateral CA1 subfield of hippocampus the expression of Cyclin D1, E, A and B1 in neurons was significantly gradually up-regulated at 7th and 14th day after reperfusion (P<0.05) as compared with that in control group. In the ipsilateral cerebral cortex the expression of Cyclin D1 and B1 in neurons was notably gradually down-regulated at 7th and 14th day, and that of Cyclin E and A was significantly up-regulated at 14th day after reperfusion as compared with that in control group (all P<0.05). It was concluded that there was a differential sensitivity among neurons from different brain regions to ischemic injury. But all of them re-enter into cell cycle after MCAO.
