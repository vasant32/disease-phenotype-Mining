OBJECTIVE: To analyse the effects of buyang huanwu decoction (BYHWT) on differentially expressed genes during cerebral ischemia/reperfusion in rats with DNA microarray. METHOD: cDNA microarray chips containing 512 cDNAs were made by Biostar Genechip Inc. Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with an filament. Saline or BYHWT was given p.o. after onset of cerebral ischemia and brains were removed after 24 h of recirculation for mRNAs isolation. A differential measurment of mRNAs from post-ischemic and BYHWT treated animals was performed with microarray. RESULT: Up-and down-regulated genes were 69 and 80 in ischemic group. Up-and down-regulated genes were 25 and 6 in BYHWT treated group. CONCLUSION: BYHWT regulates the differential expression genes after focal brain ischemia/reperfusion in rats, due to its mechanism of protecting cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.
