During focal cerebral ischemia, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) can contribute to the loss of microvessel integrity within ischemic regions by degrading the basal lamina. MMP-2 is secreted in latent form (pro-MMP-2), but the activation of pro-MMP-2 in the ischemic territory has not been shown. Immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization studies of the expression of the direct activators of MMP-2, MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP, and the indirect activation system tissue plasminogen activator, urokinase (u-PA), its receptor (u-PAR), and its inhibitor PAI-1 after middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion were undertaken in basal ganglia samples from 26 adolescent male baboons. The expressions of all three MMPs, u-PA, u-PAR, and PA1-1, but not tissue plasminogen activator, were increased from 1 hour after middle cerebral artery occlusion in the ischemic core. mRNA transcripts confirmed the increases in latent MMP-2, u-PA, u-PAR, and PAI-1 antigen very early after middle cerebral artery occlusion. The expression patterns are consistent with secretion of pro-MMP-2 and its activators in the ischemic core, perhaps from separate cell compartments. The rapid and coordinate appearance of pro-MMP-2 and its activation apparatus suggest that in the primate striatum this protease may participate in matrix injury during focal cerebral ischemia.
