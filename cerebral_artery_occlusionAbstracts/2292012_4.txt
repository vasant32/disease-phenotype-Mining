Seventy-two hours following a middle cerebral artery occlusion, the associated increase in water content on the ischemic side was significantly reduced by the exogenous administration of monosialoganglioside GM1 (30 mg/kg, i.p.). The levels of dopamine and serotonin on the ischemic side were approximately 50% and 80% of those on the contralateral non-ischemic side, respectively. Treatment with GM1 (5 times during the first 48 h after occlusion) produced a significant reduction in the levels of dopamine and serotonin loss. The present findings are compatible with the observed protective action of the exogenously administered GM1 following ischemic brain injury.
