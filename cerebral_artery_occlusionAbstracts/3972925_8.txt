In anesthetized adult cats, acute stroke was produced by transorbital occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery. A battery of imaging techniques was used for simultaneous evaluation of regional blood flow, glucose utilization, protein synthesis, pH, and the regional tissue content of glucose, ATP, and potassium. The electrophysiological impact of stroke was monitored by EEG frequency analysis and recording of somatosensory evoked potentials. Two hours after vascular occlusion, a close correlation existed between the degree of electrophysiological changes and biochemical alterations, in particular with the extent of tissue acidosis, ATP depletion, decrease of tissue potassium content, and suppression of protein synthesis. However, there was only a poor correlation with blood flow and glucose utilization. Both of these exhibited a greatly inhomogeneous pattern with regions of reduced, normal, or increased rates. In areas remote from the infarct, the content of biochemical substrates was normal but blood flow was reduced globally by approximately 50% and glucose utilization by approximately 20%. An anatomically defined regional pattern of cerebral or cerebellar diaschisis was not observed. It is concluded that during the acute phase of stroke, imaging of blood flow and glucose utilization does not provide an accurate estimate of the actual functional or metabolic disturbance. For the clinical evaluation of the development or treatment of stroke, in consequence, alternative noninvasive techniques such as imaging of protein synthesis and/or pH may be more relevant.
