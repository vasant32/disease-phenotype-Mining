The purposes of this study were to investigate the role of nitric oxide (NO), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and 70 kDa heat shock protein in brain ischemic tolerance induced by ischemic preconditioning and lipopolysaccharide. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced in rats by intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion. Infarct volume was significantly reduced (1) in rats subjected to 3 min ischemia 72 h prior to 60 min ischemia; (2) in rats administered lipopolysaccharide (0.5 mg/kg; i.p.) 72 h prior to 60 min ischemia compared with controls. The beneficial effect of ischemic preconditioning was unchanged despite prior administration of nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a NOS inhibitor. Conversely, the protective effect of lipopolysaccharide was nullified by L-NAME. Using immunohistochemical techniques, we observed that (1) ischemic preconditioning but not lipopolysaccharide induces the expression of 70 kDa heat shock protein in cerebral cortex and (2) lipopolysaccharide induces early increased expression of endothelial NOS in cerebral blood vessels. The results suggest that (1) endothelium-derived NO plays a role of a trigger in the brain tolerance induced by lipopolysaccharide, and (2) 70 kDa heat shock protein is involved in the protection afforded by ischemic preconditioning but not by lipopolysaccharide.
