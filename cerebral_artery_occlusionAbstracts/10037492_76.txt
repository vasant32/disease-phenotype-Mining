Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1, HSP32) is an early gene that is responsive to an array of pathological conditions including, but not limited to, hypoxia and cerebral ischemia. HO-1 cleaves the heme molecule and produces carbon monoxide (CO) and biliverdin (an antioxidant) and is essential for iron homeostasis. The purpose of this study was to investigate, using transgenic (Tg) mice, whether overexpression of HO-1 in the brain augments or attenuates cellular injury caused by ischemic stroke. Homozygous HO-1 Tg mice that overexpress HO-1 under the control of the neuron-specific enolase promoter (characterized previously) were used. Under halothane anesthesia and normothermic conditions, wild-type nontransgenic (nTg; n = 22) and HO-1 Tg (n = 24) mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Six hours after induction of ischemia, Tg and nTg mice developed infarcts that were 39 +/- 6 and 63 +/- 9 mm3, respectively (p < 0.01). No significant difference between the two strains was observed in the values of brain edema (11.3 +/- 4% in Tg vs. 14.6 +/- 5% in nTg; p < 0.1). At 24 h after MCAo, Tg mice exhibited significant neuroprotection as determined by the stroke volumes (41 +/- 2 mm3 in Tg vs. 74 +/- 5 mm3 in nTg; p < 0.01) and values of ischemic cerebral edema (21 +/- 6% in Tg vs. 35 +/- 11% in nTg; p < 0.01). Data suggest that neuroprotection in Tg mice was, at least in part, related to the following findings: (a) constitutively up-regulated cyclic GMP and bcl-2 levels in neurons; (b) inhibition of nuclear localization of p53 protein; and (c) antioxidant action of HO-1, as detected by postischemic neuronal expression of ferritin, and decreases in iron staining and tissue lipid peroxidation. We suggest that pharmacological stimulation of HO-1 activity may constitute a novel therapeutic approach in the amelioration of ischemic injury during the acute period of stroke.
