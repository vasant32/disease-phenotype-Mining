The aim of this study is to clarify whether the activation of a Na(+)/H(+) exchanger (NHE) is tightly concerned with neuronal and glial cell injury induced by ischemia using a selective NHE inhibitor, SM-20220 (N-(aminoiminomethyl)-1-methyl-1H-indole-2-carboxamide methanesulfonate). Two hours of hypoxia followed by 24 h of reoxygenation induced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, a marker of cell membrane damage, in cultured neurons and glia derived from rats. SM-20220 significantly reduced LDH release in both cells in a concentration-dependent manner, and this effect was statistically significant at concentrations of more than 10(-8) mol/l for neurons and 10(-7) mol/l for glia. A standard NHE inhibitor, 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride, also reduced LDH release in neurons at concentrations of more than 10(-7) mol/l. In a rat transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model, intravenous infusion of SM-20220 reduced cerebral infarction when the serum concentration of SM- 20220 was maintained at about 10(-7) mol/l. These results suggest that the activation of the NHE plays an important role in ischemic neuronal and glial cell injury, and NHE inhibitor may have good therapeutic value for the treatment of ischemic stroke.
