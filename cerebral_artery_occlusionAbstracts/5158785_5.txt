Three cases of bilateral anterior cerebral artery occlusion are presented with akinetic mutism. The anatomical distribution of the infarction in these patients combined with cases in the literature suggests that this syndrome can have a localizing value for the clinician. If increased intraventricular pressure is not present, the clinician can suspect a bilateral lesion of cingulate gyrus, medial nuclei of basal ganglia, and/or anterior and reticular nuclei of the thalamus.
