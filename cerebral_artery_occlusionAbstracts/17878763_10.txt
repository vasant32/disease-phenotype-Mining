Scutellarin is an active molecule existing in Erigeron breviscapus (vant.) Hand-Mazz. The present work was designed to study the antiischemic effects of scutellarin and its mixture with another substance, breviscapine, in male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Ligature of left anterior descending arteries was performed to induce acute myocardial infarction (MI), and the middle cerebral artery occlusion was created to induce focal cerebral ischemia. The MI size was significantly reduced by scutellarin (15 and 50 mg/kg) but not by breviscapine (5 to 50 mg/kg); the effect of scutellarin on the anti-MI was dose-dependent. Compared with control group, scutellarin (50 mg/kg) reduced the myocardium cell apoptosis in MI rats. The two drugs together (5 to 50 mg/kg) significantly reduced infarction size in focal brain ischemic rats (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences among the 3 dosages in breviscapine-treated rats, and the effect of scutellarin on the anticerebral ischemia was dose-dependent. The results demonstrate that the protective effects of scutellarin on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular ischemia were better than its mixture, breviscapine, in rats.
