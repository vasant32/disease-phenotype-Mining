Excessively released glutamate is neurotoxic. Glutamate transporters maintain the extracellular level of glutamate by uptake into glia or neurons. We examined the role of GLT-1, a glial glutamate transporter, in brain damage resulting from transient focal ischemia in mice. Heterozygous gene deletion of GLT-1 significantly augmented brain swelling resulting from 1 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion and 24 h reperfusion. In addition, this gene deletion significantly increased brain water contents in ischemic hemisphere at 6 h after reperfusion. Moreover, intraperitoneal injection of dihydrokainate (10 mg/kg), a specific inhibitor of GLT-1, augmented brain swelling. These data suggest that GLT-1 limits brain edema resulting from ischemia.
