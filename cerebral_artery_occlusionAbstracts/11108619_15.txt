Interrelation of T(1) and diffusion of water was studied in rat models of acute global and focal cerebral ischemia. Cortical T(1), as quantified with an inversion recovery method, increased by 4-7% within a few minutes of global ischemia at 4.7 and 9.4 T, but a significantly smaller change was detected at 1.5 T. The initial T(1) change occurred within seconds of cardiac arrest, much earlier than the extensive diffusion drop after 1-2 min. Thus, the initial increase in T(1) upon acute cerebral ischemia is directly caused by cessation of blood flow. In transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), prolonged T(1) relaxation was detected within 10 min, with a subsequent increase during the course of ischemia. Spin density did not change during the first hour, showing that T(1) increase was not caused by net accumulation of water. Interestingly, partial recovery of T(1) upon release of MCAO, occurring independent of long-term tissue outcome, was observed only in concert with diffusion recovery.
