Effects of calcium antagonists, Nicardipine and Nilvadipine, on neurologic deficits and size of infarct were studied in the rat middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion model. Each drug was administered immediately after induction of ischemia, and neurologic grade was evaluated 1 to 24 hours after MCA occlusion. At 24 hours post-occlusion, size of the infarct was compared with that of the control group. In addition, evolution of cerebral infarction was studied at 6 hours and 12 hours post-occlusion by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the Nilvadipine-treated group, neurologic deficits improved more rapidly and the size of infarct was significantly smaller than in the Nicardipine-treated group. MRI showed a progressive extension of cortical infarct in the untreated rat, whereas the infarct size remained unchanged in the Nilvadipine-treated rat. These results suggest the potential therapeutic usefulness of calcium antagonist for acute cerebral ischemia.
