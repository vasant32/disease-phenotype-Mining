The effect of the ganglioside GM1 on amplitude of the electroencephalogram, neurologic function, and histology has been studied in chronic middle cerebral artery occlusion in cats. Ischemia was produced by a 2-hour occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery and was followed by a 7-day observation period. GM1 was intravenously administered 30 minutes after occlusion and daily during the observation period. Using the reduction in the electroencephalogram amplitude to measure stroke severity, three cats with mild, three cats with moderate, and three cats with severe stroke were treated with 5 mg/kg GM1. Nine cats, three in each group, were treated with 30 mg/kg GM1, while nine cats, three in each group, received middle cerebral artery occlusion but no treatment. In all cats there was a precipitous fall in mean electroencephalogram amplitude during occlusion, followed by a secondary fall during the observation period. Treated cats showed better recovery of electroencephalogram amplitude during the first 4 hours of reperfusion and a smaller secondary fall than untreated cats. Treated cats, especially those treated with 5 mg/kg GM1, showed significant recovery of neurologic deficits compared with untreated cats. Histologic damage was less in treated cats than in untreated cats. Some cats treated with 30 mg/kg GM1 exhibited convulsions, whereas no untreated cat showed any seizure activity. Our findings suggest that gangliosides may improve the recovery of both neurologic deficits and morphologic damage in the central nervous system. These positive effects might be tentatively explained by stimulation of enzymatic activities such as Na+, K+-ATPase and adenyl cyclase.
