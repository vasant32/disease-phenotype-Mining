It has been demonstrated that a short ischemic event (ischemic preconditioning, IPC) results in a subsequent resistance to severe ischemia (ischemic tolerance, IT). We have recently demonstrated the role of innate immunity and in particular of toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 in brain ischemia. Several evidences suggest that TLR4 might also be involved in IT. Therefore, we have now used an in vivo model of IPC to investigate whether TLR4 is involved in IT. A 6-min temporary bilateral common carotid arteries occlusion was used for focal IPC and it was performed on TLR4-deficient mice (C57BL/10ScNJ) and animals that express TLR4 normally (C57BL/10ScSn). To assess the ability of IPC to induce IT, permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion was performed 48 h after IPC. Stroke outcome was evaluated by determination of infarct volume and assessment of neurological scores. IPC caused neuroprotection as shown by a reduction in infarct volume and better outcome in mice expressing TLR4 normally. TLR4-deficient mice showed less IPC-induced neuroprotection than wild-type animals. Western blot analysis of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) showed an up-regulation in the expression of these proteins in both substrains of mice measured 18, 24 and 48 h after IPC, being higher in mice with TLR4. Similarly, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation was observed 18, 24 and 48 h after IPC, being more intense in TLR4-expressing mice. These data demonstrate that TLR4 signalling is involved in brain tolerance as shown by the difference in the percentage of neuroprotection produced by IPC between ScSn and ScNJ (60% vs. 18%). The higher expression of TNF-alpha, iNOS and cyclooxygenase-2 and NF-kappaB activation in mice expressing TLR4 is likely to participate in this endogenous neuroprotective effect.
