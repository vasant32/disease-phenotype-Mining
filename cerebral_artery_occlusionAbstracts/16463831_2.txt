We evaluated the effects of magnesium sulfate on brain tissue oxygen (PtO2) tension, carbon dioxide (PtCO2) tension and pH (pHt) in patients undergoing temporary artery occlusion for clipping of cerebral aneurysm. We studied 18 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. All patients received standard anesthetics using target controlled infusion of propofol (3 microg/ml) and remifentanil (10 ng/ml). After craniotomy, a calibrated multiparameter sensor (Neurotrend, Diametrics Medical, Minneapolis, MN) was inserted to measure PtO2, PtCO2 and pHt in tissue at risk of ischemia during temporary artery occlusion. Patients were then randomly allocated to receive either intravenous saline or magnesium 20 mmol over 10 min followed by an infusion 4 mmol/h. Plasma magnesium concentration, brain tissue gases and pHt were determined at baseline, 30 min after study drug infusion and 4 min after temporary clipping. Data were analyzed by factorial ANOVA with repeated measures. Intergroup difference was compared with unpaired t test. P value < 0.05 was considered significant. Patient characteristics, baseline brain tissue gases and pHt did not differ between groups. Magnesium infusion increased PtO2 by 34%. Following temporary artery occlusion, PtO2 and pHt decreased and PtCO2 increased in both groups. However, tissue hypoxia was less severe and the rate of PtO2 decline was slower in the magnesium group. Our data suggested that magnesium enhances tissue oxygenation and attenuates hypoxia during temporary artery occlusion.
