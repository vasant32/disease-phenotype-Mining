Forty-four unanesthetized cats underwent temporary middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion with an implanted, externally controlled balloon cuff occluder. The occlusion was reversed to allow reperfusion of the MCA after 2 min to 24 hr of ischemia. Fourteen cats had temporary occlusions lasting 2 min to 3 hr; their neurological deficits improved or resolved after reperfusion, and brain sections showed only scattered microscopic areas of necrosis. After a 4-hr occlusion, five of nine cats (55%) recovered completely within 24 hr; two had persistent deficit when sacrificed, 10 days later, and each had a circumscribed infarct. All 18 cats undergoing 5-, 6-, 8-, and 24-hr occlusions sustained permanent neurological deficits. Three 3-hr occlusions at 2-day intervals in three cats resulted in permanent deficits and infarcts that were 25% larger than those after single 8-hr occlusions. Ten cats underwent permanent MCA occlusion; three deteriorated neurologically and died, and the survivors showed no improvement. Infarcts after 5-, 6-, and 8-hr occlusions followed by reperfusion were 66% smaller (p less than 0.05) than those after permanent occlusion; reperfusion after 24 hr of occlusion did not reduce infarct size. Hemorrhagic infarction occurred after two permanent occlusions, but after only one 5-hr temporary occlusion. The results obtained with this method of temporary regional ischemia indicate that restoration of flow after 1-8 hr, but not after 24 hr, of MCA occlusion resulted in less severe neurological deficit and smaller infarcts than did permanent occlusion. The infarct size correlated with the duration of MCA occlusion (p less than 0.05) rather than with the degree of deficit during occlusion.
