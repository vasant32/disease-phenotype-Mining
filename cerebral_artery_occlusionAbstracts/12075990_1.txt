Fetal rat kidney cells produce high levels of glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and exert neuroprotective effects when transplanted into the brain in animal models of Parkinson's disease and stroke. The purpose of the present experiment was to produce kidney cell lines that secrete GDNF. Genes encoding two truncated N-terminal fragments of SV40 large T antigen, T155g and T155c, which does not code for small t antigen, were used. T155g was transduced into E17 cultured fetal Sprague-Dawley rat kidney cortex cells using a plasmid vector, and T155c was transduced with a plasmid and a retroviral vector. Sixteen clones were isolated from cultures transfected with the T155g-expressing plasmid. No cell lines were obtained with T155c. Four clones produced GDNF at physiological concentrations ranging from 55 to 93 pg/ml of medium. These four clones were transplanted into the ischemic core or penumbra of rats that had undergone middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Three of the four clones reduced the volume of infarction and the behavioral abnormalities normally resulting from MCAO. Blocking experiments with antibodies to GDNF and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) suggested that these growth factors contributed only minimally to the reduction in infarct volume and behavioral abnormality. These cell lines may be useful for intracerebral transplantation in animal models of brain injury, stroke, or Parkinson's disease.
