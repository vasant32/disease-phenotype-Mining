Thrombolytic agent is increasingly being used in treating acute ischemic stroke. A novel protease with strong thrombolytic activity, Neanthes japonica (Iznka) fibrinolytic enzyme (NJF) discovered in our laboratory has been reported with characteristics of direct hydrolyzing fibrin and fibrinogen. The neuroprotective effect of NJF and urokinase (UK) was tested in rat models of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The model was successfully produced by introducing an intraluminal suture into the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). NJF (0.25, 0.5, 1mg/kg) was injected intravenously 1h after the onset of reperfusion. Compared with vehicle group, MCAO animals treated with NJF showed dose dependent reduction in cerebral infarction with improved neurological outcome. Meanwhile, ischemia induced cerebral edema was reduced in a dose dependent manner. Treatment with NJF at 0.5mg/kg was almost equivalent to UK at 15,000U/kg dosage in the reduction of cerebral infarction and cerebral edema. Biomedical assay showed that NJF treatment suppressed lipid peroxidation and restored superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in brain tissue. These results suggest that NJF posses neuroprotective potential in rat MCAO and reperfusion model. Neuroprotection shown by NJF may be attributed to inhibition of lipid peroxidation, increase in endogenous antioxidant defense enzymes.
