Levels of ceramide, sphingomyelin, cerebroside and gangliosides were determined in rat cerebral cortex during focal ischemia produced by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Ceramide began to increase at 6 hours of ischemia and increased to 4.5 folds at 96 hours. Amino-linked fatty acids in increased ceramide were composed solely of non-hydroxy fatty acids, and stearic acid was the most prominent. Sphingomyelin, whose amino-linked fatty acids were mostly stearic acid, decreased in a time-dependent manner and became about a half of controls at 96 hours. Hydroxy fatty acid linked cerebroside decreased at and after 6 hours of ischemia, whereas significant decrease of non-hydroxy fatty acid linked cerebroside occurred only at 96 hours of ischemia. There were no measurable changes in the levels of gangliosides. The results suggested that ceramide was produced in the cerebral cortex by the breakdown of sphingomyelin during ischemia.
