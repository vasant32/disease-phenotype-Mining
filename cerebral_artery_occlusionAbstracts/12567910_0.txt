AIM: To investigate the relationship between the neuroprotective effect of alpha-dihydroergocryptine (alpha-DHEC) and the activation of nuclear factor Kappa B (NF-Kappa B). METHODS: Adult male rats were subjected to cerebral ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). DNA binding activity of NF-Kappa B was determined with electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) in animals subjected to varying durations of cerebral ischemia. Neuroapoptosis induced by ischemic damage was measured by deoxynucleotidy transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and flow cytometry (FCM) analysis. RESULTS: No change was observed in nuclear NF-Kappa B DNA binding in normal animal. A low level of constitutive NF-Kappa B DNA binding was detected in animals subjected to cerebral ischemia of 1 h, and significant increase in the amount of active NF-Kappa B in nuclear extracts was observed after cerebral ischemia of 3 h, 6 h, and 12 h. Peak of NF-Kappa B DNA binding was observed at the time point of 3 h. Animals subjected to cerebral ischemia of 3 h potentially initiates neuroapoptosis and activates NF-Kappa B in nuclear extract. Alpha-DHEC (100 micrograms.kg-1 and 150 micrograms.kg-1) showed significant protective effect on neuroapoptosis-induced by cerebral ischemia of 3 h, and inhibiting NF-Kappa B activation using 100 mg.kg-1 pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC) in the continuous presence of alpha-DHEC, the neuroprotective effect of alpha-DHEC was blocked. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that the neuroprotetive effect of alpha-DHEC may depend on the activation of NF-Kappa B.
