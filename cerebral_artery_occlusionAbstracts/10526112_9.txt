In order to examine the effect of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) on ischemic brain injury, NT-3 was topically applied to brain surface just after 90 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. NT-3 significantly reduced the infarct size at 24 h of reperfusion. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin in situ nick labeling (TUNEL) staining and immunohistochemical study for caspase-3 and heat shock protein 72 (HSP72) showed that NT-3 treatment decreased the number of cells with DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 and HSP72 expressions. These data suggest that NT-3 protects neuronal cells from ischemic injury, and it is possibly associated with inhibition of DNA fragmentation.
