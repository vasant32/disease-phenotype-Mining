The time evolution of water diffusion, perfusion, T1, and T2 is investigated at high magnetic field (8.5 T) following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat. Cerebral blood flow maps were obtained using arterial spin tagging. Although the quantitative perfusion measurements in ischemic tissue still pose difficulties, the combined perfusion and diffusion data nevertheless distinguish between a "moderately affected area," with reduced perfusion but normal diffusion; and a "severely affected area," in which both perfusion and diffusion are significantly reduced. Two novel magnetic resonance imaging observations are reported, namely, a decrease in T2 and an increase in T1, both within the first few minutes of ischemia. The rapid initial decrease in T2 is believed to be associated with an increase in deoxyhemoglobin levels, while the initial increase in T1 may be related to several factors, such as flow effects, an alteration in tissue oxygenation, and changes in water environment.
