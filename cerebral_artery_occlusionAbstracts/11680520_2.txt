Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein is involved in apoptotic death of cultured neuronal cells, but its role in ischemic brain damage remains uncertain. In this study, we investigated change of immunoreactivity for PML protein in rat brain after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, and compared the results with that of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin in situ nick end labeling (TUNEL). Western blotting analysis revealed that PML immunoreactivity was only scant in the sham-control brain, but it increased at 1 h and 1 day after reperfusion, and decreased in density thereafter. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that nuclei of neurons were most densely stained. TUNEL positive cells appeared at 1 day and peaked at 3 days of reperfusion, indicating that PML protein induction preceded DNA fragmentation in neurons. The present results suggest that PML protein may be one of the key molecules in ischemic neuronal cell death.
