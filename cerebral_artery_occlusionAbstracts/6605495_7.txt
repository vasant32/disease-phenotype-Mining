We studied five patients who had acute cerebral infarctions 5 weeks to 6 months after herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO). All had infarcts of the cerebral hemisphere ipsilateral to the HZO, and one also had a cerebellar infarct. Cerebral arteriography in one patient disclosed narrowing of the middle cerebral artery, occlusion of the anterior cerebral artery ipsilateral to the HZO and narrowing of the opposite anterior cerebral artery. In another case, arteriography revealed occlusion of the distal internal carotid artery on the side of the HZO.
