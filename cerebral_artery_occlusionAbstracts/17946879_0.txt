The dynamic profile of multi parameters of electroencephalogram (EEG) pathology associated with middle cerebral ischemia occlusion in a rat model were measured. Both pronounced increase in delta activity and decrease in theta activity during ischemic injuries were observed accompanied with decrease in the complexity of EEG. Different characteristic dynamic profiles might imply different mechanism underline the specific pathological process.
