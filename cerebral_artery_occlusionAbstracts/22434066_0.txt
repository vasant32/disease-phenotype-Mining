Although treatment of stroke patients with mild hypothermia is a promising therapeutic approach, chemicals inducing prompt and safe reduction of body temperature are an unmet need. We measured the effects of the transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) agonist rinvanil on thermoregulation and ischemic brain injury in mice. Intraperitoneal or intracerebroventricular injection of rinvanil induces mild hypothermia that is prevented by the receptor antagonist capsazepine. Both intraischemic and postischemic treatments provide permanent neuroprotection in animals subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo), an effect lost in mice artificially kept normothermic. Data indicate that TRPV1 receptor agonists are promising candidates for hypothermic treatment of stroke.
