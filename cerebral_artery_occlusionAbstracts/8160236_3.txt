BACKGROUND: Hemispheric strokes of hydatid origin are very rare. We describe two cases of middle cerebral artery occlusion by a cyst of cardiac origin. CASE DESCRIPTIONS: Cerebral angiography demonstrated occlusion of the initial segment of the middle cerebral artery. Myocardial and pericardial cysts were diagnosed by echography and pathological examination. Subsequent development of hydatid cysts within the necrotic area of the infarcted hemisphere suggests cerebral hydatid embolism of cardiac origin. CONCLUSIONS: In endemic areas, embolism of hydatid cysts should be considered in the diagnosis of stroke in young patients.
