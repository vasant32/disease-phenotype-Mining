The investigations that have thus far evaluated the cerebral protective properties of isoflurane have provided conflicting results. Protection would be most likely to occur in the circumstances of incomplete cerebral ischaemia in which there is a penumbral zone of marginal perfusion. The present investigation sought to evaluate further the protective properties of isoflurane in that circumstance. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was performed in Sprague-Dawley rats anaesthetized with 1.2 MAC concentrations of either halothane or isoflurane. At the end of four hours of MCAO, the brains were removed, sectioned and incubated in the histochemical stain 2-3-triphenyltetrazolium (TTC). An image analysis system was used to measure the area of reduced or absent TTC staining in four coronal planes spanning the distribution of the middle cerebral artery. There was no difference between halothane and isoflurane anaesthetized animals with respect to the area of brain with evidence of histochemical dysfunction. It is concluded that isoflurane is not protective (relative to the status of halothane anaesthetized control animals) when administered at 1.2 MAC concentration during four hours of focal (incomplete) cerebral ischaemia in the rat.
