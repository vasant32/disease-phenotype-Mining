Normobaric hyperoxia treatment has recently been demonstrated to be remarkably beneficial in acute focal ischemia. The present study compared hyperoxia treatment with a novel heliox treatment. Adult male rats breathed 30% oxygen and 70% nitrogen (control group), 100% oxygen (hyperoxia group), or 30% oxygen and 70% helium (heliox group) during a middle cerebral artery occlusion for 2 h and a 1-hour reperfusion (n=6 in each group). Neurological deficits were scored at 3 and 24 h post focal ischemia. Neither the physiological parameters (body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, O(2) saturation, and laser Doppler cerebral blood) nor the 3-hour post ischemia neurological scores differed between groups. However, the neurological scores showed a statistically significant improvement at 24 h post ischemia in the heliox group (p<0.05). The infarct volume (mean+SD) as measured by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium staining included 36+/-17% of the involved hemisphere in the control group, 16+/-14% in the hyperoxia group, and 4+/-2% in the heliox group (p<0.01). In conclusion, whereas hyperoxia reduced the infarct volume, heliox further reduced the infarct volume and improved 24-hour neurological deficits in a rat model of focal ischemia. This suggests that a greater benefit may accrue from heliox therapy.
