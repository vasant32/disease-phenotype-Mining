BACKGROUND: Protein S is an antithrombotic factor that also exhibits mitogenic activity. Thus, we hypothesized that protein S may control cerebrovascular thrombosis in stroke and protect brain tissue from ischemic injury. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied protein S in a murine in vivo model of stroke and an in vitro model of neuronal hypoxia/reoxygenation injury. Animals received purified human plasma-derived protein S or vehicle intravenously 10 minutes after initiation of middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by reperfusion. Protein S at 0.2 to 2 mg/kg significantly improved the motor neurological deficit by 3.8- to 3.2-fold and reduced infarction and edema volumes by 45% to 54% and 45% to 62%, respectively. Protein S at 2 mg/kg improved postischemic cerebral blood flow by 21% to 26% and reduced brain fibrin deposition and infiltration with neutrophils by 40% and 53%, respectively. Intracerebral bleeding was not observed with protein S. Protein S protected ischemic neurons in vivo and cultured neurons from hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Recombinant human protein S exerted protective effects from hypoxia-induced damage similar to the plasma-derived protein S both in vivo and in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Protein S is a significant neuroprotectant during ischemic brain injury with direct effects on neurons and antithrombotic effects. Thus, protein S could be a prototype of a new class of agents for clinical stroke with combined direct neuronal protective effects and systemic antithrombotic and antiinflammatory activities.
