BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intracerebral hemorrhage, induced by recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) in ischemic stroke, is attributable to the increased activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Patients with acute infarct benefit from the neuroprotective drug edaravone, a free radical scavenger. We examined the mechanisms by which edaravone may help to suppress rtPA-induced brain hemorrhage. METHODS: Male Wistar rats weighing 250 to 280 g were subjected to 3-hour transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and divided randomly into 3 groups. Immediately after reperfusion, 1 group was intravenously injected with 10 mg/kg rtPA, another with rtPA plus 3 mg/kg edaravone, and the 3rd group received no treatment. We assessed the hemorrhage volume and the activity of MMP-9 in the brain 24 hours postischemia. We also studied the activity of MMP-9, its mRNA expression, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activity in rtPA-stimulated human microvascular endothelial cells (HBECs). RESULTS: The degree of hemorrhage and the level of endothelial cell-derived MMP-9 were elevated in rats treated with rtPA alone and attenuated in rats treated with rtPA plus edaravone. In rtPA-stimulated HBECs, edaravone suppressed the activity and mRNA expression of MMP-9 in a dose-dependent manner. Edaravone also inhibited NF-kappaB activation. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that edaravone inhibits rtPA-induced cerebral hemorrhage in the ischemic brain of rats via the inhibition of MMP-9 expression in vivo, which is substantiated by inhibition of MMP-9 expression and NF-kappaB activation in HBECs. Edaravone may render thrombolytic therapy safer for the administration of rtPA in patients with ischemic stroke.
