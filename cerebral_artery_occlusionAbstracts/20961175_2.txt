 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To analyse the efficacy of bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (MNCs) in traversing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in an experimental model of stroke. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: The middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) mouse model was established and behavioural and histological analysis was performed, subsequently the carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA)-labelled MNCs were transplanted through the tail vein immediately after 23 hours of reperfusion. The fluorescence microscopic analysis of the brain sections was analysed in both acute and sub-acute phases of transplantation. RESULTS: The neurological deficit was confirmed by TTC staining and contra lateral turning behaviour. After 2 and 7 days of transplantation, the CFDA-labelled MNCs were observed in the infarcted regions along the line of cortex. CONCLUSION: The presence of the CFDA-labelled cells in the ischaemic injured brain lesions proved homing of the implanted MNCs in the infarcted regions of the brain. The successful homing of MNCs may pave way for future clinical trials using MNC in stroke.
