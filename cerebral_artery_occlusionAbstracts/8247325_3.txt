The dose-response curve and time window of efficacy for dextrorphan in permanent focal brain ischemia leading to infarction was studied in the rat. With pretreatment, the maximum effective dose of 20 mg/kg reduced the eventual infarct volume by greater than 50%. Delayed drug administration, up to 45 min following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion, significantly reduced infarct size.
