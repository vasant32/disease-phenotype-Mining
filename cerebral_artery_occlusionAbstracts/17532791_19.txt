Despite 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2) and tricyclodecan-9-yl-xanthogenate (D609) having multiple effects on cancer cells, mechanistically, both of them down-regulate hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We hypothesize HIF-1alpha plays an essential role in cerebral ischemia as a pro-apoptosis regulator; 2ME2 and D609 decrease the levels of HIF-1alpha and VEGF, that might contribute to protecting brain from ischemia injury. A total of 102 male Sprague-Dawley rats were split into five groups: sham, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), MCAO + dimethyl sulfoxide, MCAO + 2ME2, and MCAO + D609. 2ME2 and D609 were injected intraperitoneally 1 h after reperfusion. Rats were killed at 24 h and 7 days. At 24 h, 2ME2 and D609 reduce the levels of HIF-1alpha and VEGF (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), depress the expression of HIF-1alpha, VEGF, BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) and cleaved caspase 3 (western blot and immunohistochemistry) in the brain infarct area. Double fluorescence labeling shows HIF-1alpha positive immunoreactive materials are co-localized with BNIP3 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling inside the nuclei of neurons. At 7 days, 2ME2 and D609 reduce the infarct volume (2,3,7-triphenyltetrazolium chloride) and blood-brain barrier extravasation, decrease the mortality and improve the neurological deficits. In conclusion, 2ME2 and D609 are powerful agents to protect brain from cerebral ischemic injury by inhibiting HIF-1alpha expression, attenuating the superfluous expression of VEGF to avoid blood-brain barrier disruption and suppressing neuronal apoptosis via BNIP3 pathway.
