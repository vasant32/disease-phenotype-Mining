The long-term effects of the 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist ketanserin on deficits in sensorimotor integration (limb placing tests) following transient focal cerebral ischemia in rats were compared to the effects of the NMDA antagonist MK-801. Middle cerebral artery occlusion was induced in conscious rats by microinjection of endothelin-1 in the vicinity of the artery (EMCAO model). The EMCAO/vehicle rats exhibited impaired tactile and proprioceptive limb placing. In contrast to ketanserin, MK-801 exerted severe early behavioral disturbances, but both drugs significantly improved the neurological scores much earlier than the spontaneous recovery of function occurred. The present results suggest that pharmacotherapy by means of ketanserin lacking the severe side effects of the NMDA antagonists can be used to enhance functional recovery after stroke.
