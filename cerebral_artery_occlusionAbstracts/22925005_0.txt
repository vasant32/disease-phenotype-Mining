 AIMS: Ischemic postconditioning (IPostC) has been proved to have neuroprotective effects for cerebral ischemia, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. This study aimed at validating the neuroprotective effects of IPostC and investigating whether the neuroprotection of IPostC is associated with matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and the extracellular matrix proteins, laminin and fibronectin, following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion in rats. METHODS: The rats in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group underwent MCAO and reperfusion, and the animals in MCAO + IPostC group were treated by occluding bilateral common carotid arteries for 10 seconds and then reperfusing for 10 seconds for five episodes at the beginning of MCAO. Apoptosis was detected with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling staining. The expression of MMP9, laminin, and fibronectin was measured with immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: IPostC reduced brain edema and infarct volume and improved the neurological function. Furthermore, IPostC decreased cell apoptosis compared with the MCAO group. Compared to the MCAO group, IPostC treatment reduced MMP9 expression. Moreover, the results showed that the expression of laminin and fibronectin significantly increased in the MCAO + IPostC group compared to the MCAO group. CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that diminishment of MMP9 expression and the attenuation of degradation of laminin and fibronectin may be involved in the protective mechanisms of postconditioning against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.
