Nuclear factor TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) is considered to play roles in pathogenesis of human neurodegenerative diseases, so-called TDP-43 proteinopathy, via its proteolytic cleavage, abnormal phosphorylation, subcellular redistribution, and insolubilization generating TDP-43-positive neuronal intracellular inclusions. The purpose of this study was to elucidate biochemical and histopathological alternations in TDP-43 specific to acute ischemic stroke. Adult male rats were subjected to a 90-min middle cerebral artery occlusion. We examined the proteolytic cleavage, phosphorylation, subcellular localization, and solubility of TDP-43 by immunoblottings and histopathological examinations using the ischemic and sham-operated cortex. The level of full-length TDP-43 (43 kDa) decreased and that of the 25-kDa C-terminal fragment increased after acute ischemic stroke, which can be explained by proteolytic cleavage of TDP-43. Cytoplasmic redistribution and altered nuclear distribution of TDP-43 was observed after acute ischemic stroke, whereas abnormal phosphorylation and insolubilization of TDP-43 as well as formation of intracellular inclusions were not observed. Ischemic neurons with the cytoplasmic redistribution of TDP-43 expressed ubiquitin and activated caspase 3 and were terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated uridine 5'-triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling-positive. In conclusion, biochemical and histopathological alterations in TDP-43 were identified in rats after acute ischemic stroke, although there was very less similarity between TDP-43 alterations observed in acute ischemic stroke and those observed in TDP-43 proteinopathy.
