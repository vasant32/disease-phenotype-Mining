The molecular mechanisms that lead to ischemic pre-conditioning are not completely understood, and proteins are important players. We compared the mouse brain cortex proteome from different ischemia sets: transient (7 min) middle cerebral artery occlusion (7'MCAo, pre-conditioning stimulus), permanent MCAo (pMCAo, severe ischemia), and pMCAo 4 days after 7'MCAo (7'MCAo/pMCAo, pre-conditioned model). Proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis coupled to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Overall, 28 proteins were expressed differentially from sham controls, and identified. The ischemic pre-conditioning stimulus alone up-regulated the stress protein heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70), possibly activated by the androgen receptor. Western blotting confirmed the increased expression of HSP70 and showed that androgen receptor expression paralleled that of HSP70. In the ischemic-tolerant group (7'MCAo/pMCAo), a number of proteins over-expressed after pMCAo returned to sham levels, seven proteins remained up-regulated as in pMCAo, and five proteins mainly involved in energy metabolism and mitochondrial electron transport and unchanged in pMCAo were down-regulated only in ischemic tolerance, suggesting a role in brain pre-conditioning. Astrocytes participated in ischemic-tolerance induction, as shown by the down-regulation of glutamine synthetase in the 7'MCAo/pMCAo group. The results suggest that metabolic down-regulation was a general feature of ischemic pre-conditioning, playing a pivotal role in neuroprotection.
