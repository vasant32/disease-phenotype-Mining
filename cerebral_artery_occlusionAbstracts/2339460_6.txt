We measured cerebral blood flow and somatosensory evoked potentials during transient focal cerebral ischemia in cats to compare the effects of four commonly used anesthetic regimens: ketamine/fentanyl/N2O (fentanyl), pentobarbital, ketamine/alpha-chloralose (alpha-chloralose), and ketamine/halothane/N2O (halothane). Six cats in each group were subjected to 60 minutes of left middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by 120 minutes of reperfusion. Although the amplitude of the initial somatosensory evoked potential wave complex was highest in the alpha-chloralose group (58.6 +/- 16.5 microV) and smallest in the halothane group (27.5 +/- 5.7 microV), amplitude fell by 75% in all groups upon occlusion. Baseline cerebral blood flow varied substantially between groups (e.g., in the right intersylvian gyrus: fentanyl, 96 +/- 12; pentobarbital, 30 +/- 5; alpha-chloralose, 24 +/- 3; and halothane, 76 +/- 11 ml/min/100 g). Occlusion decreased cerebral blood flow to subcortical (e.g., left caudate) structures in all groups (fentanyl, 29 +/- 11%; pentobabital, 45 +/- 12%; alpha-chloralose, 27 +/- 13%; and halothane, 18 +/- 5% of baseline). Postischemic hyperemia occurred in the cortical regions of cats anesthetized with pentobarbital or alpha-chloralose that had reduced cerebral blood flows during occlusion but not in cats anesthetized with fentanyl (cerebral blood flow during occlusion not different from that of cats anesthetized with pentobarbital or alpha-chloralose) or halothane. After 120 minutes of reperfusion, cerebral blood flow had returned to baseline values in all groups. Recovery of cerebral blood flow and somatosensory evoked potential amplitude at that time did not differ among groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
