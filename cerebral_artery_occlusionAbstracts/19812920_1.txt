PURPOSE: To investigate the neuronal response to ischemic injury following exposure to whole brain proton irradiation. METHODS: Brain only proton irradiation (8 Gy, 250 MeV) was performed ten days prior to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in 1 year old male Sprague Dawley rats. MCAO was induced in two animal groups: proton irradiated (MCAO + Rad) and MCAO only. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and quantitative analysis were performed prior to and 2 days after irradiation, and then 2, 14 and 28 days after MCAO. After the last imaging time point animals were sacrificed and TUNEL staining was performed on 4% paraformaldehyde - fixed brain sections. RESULTS: Neuroimaging demonstrated a reduction in ischemic lesion volume in the MCAO + Rad group compared with MCAO alone. Neurological deficits did not differ between ischemia groups. Interestingly, there was a 34% decrease in the number of TUNEL-positive cells in MCAO + Rad brains compared to MCAO alone. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that radiation treatment reduces brain edema, ischemic lesion volume and peri-ischemic apoptosis. The underlying mechanisms are currently unknown and additional studies will elucidate the significance of these results.
