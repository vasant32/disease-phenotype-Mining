The development of ischemic edema after middle cerebral artery occlusion in a rat was studied using T1 and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Examinations were performed with Helmholtz coil and multiple echo sequences with TR 1,500 ms and TE 30-240 ms (8 echoes) were used. T2 prolongation was noted already 3 hours after experimental stroke and the values increased during the time of the study. T1-weighted images were much less sensitive for the detection of increased water content. This experiment forms a basis for MR studies on the formation and resolution of cerebral edema and can be useful for studies on efficacy of different medical measures against ischemic edema.
