 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The serine-threonine kinase Akt is activated by phosphorylation at serine-473. After phosphorylation, activated Akt inactivates BAD or caspase-9 or other apoptogenic components, thereby inhibiting cell death. In this study we examined the relationship between Akt phosphorylation and oxidative stress after transient focal cerebral ischemia (FCI) using copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) transgenic (Tg) mice. METHODS: The mice were subjected to 60 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion by intraluminal suture blockade followed by 1, 4, and 24 hours of reperfusion. Phospho-Akt expression was examined by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Production of superoxide anion was assessed by the hydroethidine method in both wild-type mice and SOD1 Tg mice. DNA fragmentation was evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated uridine 5'-triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL). RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that phospho-Akt was constitutively expressed and was decreased in the ischemic core as early as 1 hour after reperfusion, whereas it was temporally increased in the cortex at 4 hours. Phospho-Akt expression was enhanced in the SOD1 Tg mice. Western blot analysis showed that phospho-Akt was maximized 4 hours after reperfusion in the wild-type mice, whereas phospho-Akt was increased as early as 1 hour after ischemia in the SOD1 Tg mice. There was a significant decrease in TUNEL-positive cells in the SOD1 Tg mice compared with the wild-type mice. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that SOD1 may contribute to the early activation of the Akt cell survival signaling pathway and may attenuate subsequent DNA damage after transient FCI.
