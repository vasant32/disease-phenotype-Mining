Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) has been recognised as an entity since 1924, and haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) since 1955. The disease processes have generated new interest during the past two decades, and much progress has been made both in understanding and treating these diseases. They are best thought of as part of the same disease spectrum, characterised by thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia on the blood film. We present a patient with HUS/ TTP who developed the macroangiopathic thrombotic complications of coronary occlusion causing myocardial infarction, and cerebral artery occlusion causing massive stroke. To our knowledge, this is the first published report of macroangiopathic complications of this condition.
