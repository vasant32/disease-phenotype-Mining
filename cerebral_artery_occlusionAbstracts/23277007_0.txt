Detection of microvascular changes in experimental stroke models is limited by current technologies. Using state-of-the-art synchrotron radiation (SR), we explored the feasibility of detecting the normal morphological variations of lenticulostriate arteries (LSAs) and the changes to LSAs following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Cerebral microvessels of ICR mice were imaged with synchrotron radiation microangiography using nonionic iodine and barium sulfate as contrast agents. Using SR we reproducibly observed the detailed cerebral microvasculature of LSAs arising from the origin of middle cerebral artery (MCA) with a resolution of approximately 5 micrometers, at least a 20-fold greater resolution compared to CT or MRI imaging. Notably, SR microangiography was able to reveal ischemia/reperfusion induced leakage in the lenticulostriate artery territory. To our knowledge this is the first time that the three-dimensional morphology of LSAs and real time visualization of LSA hemorrhage have been characterized in live mice. This work demonstrates that SR microangiography can provide a unique tool for furthering experimental stroke research to examine the efficacy of neuroprotective therapies on parameters such as angiogenesis and vascular integrity.
