This study examined outcomes of patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with major cerebral artery occlusion after the approval of intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (IV rt-PA) but before approval of the MERCI retriever. We retrospectively enrolled 1170 consecutive patients with AIS and major cerebral artery occlusion (496 women; mean age, 73.9 ± 12.3 years) who were admitted within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms to 12 Japanese stroke centers between October 2005 and June 2009. Cardioembolism was a leading cause of AIS in this group (68.2%). The occlusion sites of the major cerebral arteries included the common carotid artery and internal carotid artery (ICA; 29.6%), middle cerebral artery (52.2%), and basilar artery (7.6%). Recanalization therapy (RT) was performed in 32.0% of patients (IV rt-PA, 20.0%; neuroendovascular therapy, 9.4%; combined, 2.5%). Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage within 36 hours with a ≥1-point increase in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score occurred in 5.3% of the patients. At 3 months (or at hospital discharge), 29.3% of the patients had a favorable outcome (based on a modified Rankin scale score of 0-2), 23.8% were bedridden, and 15.6% died. After multivariate adjustment, RT was positively associated with a favorable outcome and negatively associated with death, whereas age, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, and ICA occlusion were negatively associated with a favorable outcome and positively associated with death. One-third of the patients with AIS and major cerebral artery occlusion were treated with RT, which was independently associated with favorable outcomes and death. However, 40% of the patients became bedridden or died during the post-alteplase, pre-MERCI era in Japan.
