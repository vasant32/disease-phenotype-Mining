In this work, focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion were induced by the model of middle cerebral artery occlusion. The dialysate of extracellular fluid in the hypothalamus of rats were obtained by using brain microdialysis technique. An efficient and sensitive MEKC method for the simultaneous determination of multiple amino acid neurotransmitters in microdialysate was developed by capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection and 5-(4, 6-dichloro-s-triazin-2-ylamino) fluorescein derivatization. Different parameters that influenced derivatization reaction and CE separation were studied and optimized. This method was used to investigate the dynamic change of fourteen amino acid neurotransmitters in microdialysates during cerebral ischemia/reperfusion period. Our results reveal that MCAO and reperfusion elicited significant increases in the extracellular levels of Arg, Lys, Trp, Phe, Gln, GABA, Asn, Pro, Ser, Ala, Tau, Gly, Glu and Asp. The excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmitter balance was disturbed during ischemia/reperfusion. The dynamic changes and functional status of releasable neurotransmitters during ischemia/reperfusion were discussed.
