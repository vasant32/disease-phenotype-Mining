In many recovering hemiparetic stroke patients, movement of the affected limb elicits ipsilateral activation of sensorimotor areas within the undamaged hemisphere, which is not observed in control subjects. Following middle cerebral artery occlusion, rats received intensive enriched-rehabilitation (ER) of the impaired forelimb for 4 weeks. Weekly assessments on a skilled reaching test demonstrated significant improvement in ischemic animals over 4 weeks of ER (P < 0.05). We hypothesized that if the undamaged forelimb motor cortex contributed to improved forelimb function, then inhibition of neural activity within this region should reinstate (at least some of) the initial motor impairment. After 3 and 4 weeks of ER, animals received a microinjection of lidocaine hydrochloride into the undamaged motor cortex and were re-assessed on reaching ability. The behavioral effect of lidocaine challenge was dependent on the size of the infarct: animals with large infarcts were rendered unable to retrieve any food pellets and had great difficulty even contacting a pellet with the affected forepaw. Small-infarct animals were only moderately affected (25% reduction in success) by lidocaine, an effect similar to that observed in control animals. Qualitative assessments of recovered reaching after 4 weeks of rehabilitation revealed that impairments in forelimb lift, advance and aim were exacerbated (P < 0.05) following lidocaine-inactivation of the undamaged motor cortex of animals with large ischemic infarcts. In animals with small infarcts, lidocaine challenge only impaired limb advance. Thus, recruitment of the undamaged hemisphere may depend on the functional integrity of the remaining sensorimotor system. These data suggest that, in the rat, the undamaged (ipsilateral) motor system may contribute to compensatory recovery of the affected forelimb.
