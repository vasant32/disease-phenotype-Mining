The ultrastructural features of the glio-pial system have been analyzed in an animal model of brain focal ischemic lesion. Aim of the work was to describe the relationship between glial and pial cells in a condition of ischemic neurodegeneration and the eventual involvement of these cells in removal of debris and reconstruction of the glial-limiting lamina. The study was performed in rats in which the right middle cerebral artery was occluded. The development of a lesion and its extension was controlled in vivo 24 h after the middle cerebral artery occlusion by magnetic resonance imaging. The rats were sacrificed 10 or 15 days after the occlusion and their brain was processed for transmission and scanning electron microscopy. The ultrastructural examination of the lesion revealed that the nervous parenchyma was replaced by cicatricial tissue composed by glial and pial areas. The pial areas were composed mainly by leaf-like cells forming a network. Their main cytoplasmic feature was the presence of large lysosomes in which ferritine-like particles were often enclosed. The glial areas were composed by strictly packed cells which displayed at scanning electron microscopy a spider-like shape with a central body and elongated cell processes. These results suggest a role for the glio-pial system in acute ischemia. In particular, the pial cells seem to be directly involved in removal of cell debris while glial cells seem mainly devoted to the reconstruction of the glial limiting lamina.
