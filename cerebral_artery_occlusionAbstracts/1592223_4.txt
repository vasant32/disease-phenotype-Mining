1. We investigated the effect of a novel vinca alkaloid derivative, vinconate, against brain damage after focal ischemia induced by a middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in rats. 2. Persistent focal ischemia was induced by 6 hr, and vinconate (50 and 100 mg/kg) was given intraperitoneally twice 10 min and 3 hr after MCA occlusion. 3. Focal ischemia produced the disturbance of glucose metabolism, the increase of water content and the impairment of protein synthesis in the surrounding occluded MCA territory. 4. Vinconate was effective in preventing marked reduction of cerebral glucose utilization in the areas surrounding the occluded MCA territory. 5. Vinconate significantly reduced an increase of water content in the surrounding the occluded MCA territory. 6. Preliminary L-[methyl-14C]methionine autoradiographic study also indicated that vinconate can partly prevent a severe impairment of protein synthesis after focal ischemia. 7. The results indicate that vinconate may ameliorate the disturbance of glucose metabolism, brain edema and the impairment of protein synthesis after persistent focal ischemia, and they also suggest that vinconate has a beneficial effect against brain damage.
