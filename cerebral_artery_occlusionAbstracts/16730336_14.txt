BACKGROUND: Poststroke depression (PSD) leads to impaired functional recovery and increased mortality, yet physiological mechanisms are unknown. The present study investigates the roles of glucocorticoids and interleukin-1 (IL-1) in poststroke anhedonia. METHODS: Adult male mice underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and were recovered 7 days. Mice were treated with metyrapone (100 mg/kg intraperitoneally), mifepristone (50 mg/kg subcutaneously), or vehicle injections on reperfusion days 4-7. A separate cohort of mice was implanted with cannulae and was administered IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) or vehicle (6 microg intracerebroventricularly) on reperfusion days 6 and 7. After the final injection or infusion, sucrose consumption was recorded for 6 hours. RESULTS: Mice in the sham-treated group consumed significantly more sucrose solution than water, whereas MCAO-treated mice consumed similar amounts of each, suggesting anhedonia among MCAO-treated mice. A separate experiment assessed whether stroke-induced increases in corticosteroids or IL-1 contribute to anhedonia. Only IL-1ra restored sucrose consumption in MCAO-treated mice. Vehicle-MCAO-treated mice drank significantly less sucrose solution than did both IL-1ra and vehicle-sham treatment groups, whereas IL-1ra-MCAO-treated mice drank similar amounts to both sham-treated groups. CONCLUSIONS: Poststroke anhedonia, a symptom of depression in human beings, can be reproduced in a mouse model of stroke and appears to involve altered IL-1 transmission in the brain.
