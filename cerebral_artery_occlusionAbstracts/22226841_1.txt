We investigated the effect of CDP-choline on brain plasticity markers expression in the acute phase of cerebral infarct in an experimental animal model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) and treated or not with CDP-choline (500 mg/kg) daily for 14 days starting 30 min after pMCAO. Functional status was evaluated with Roger's test; lesion volume with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E); cell death with TUNEL; cellular proliferation with BrdU immunohistochemistry; vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), synaptophysin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) by immunofluorescence and Western-blot techniques. CDP-choline significantly improved functional recovery and decreased lesion volume on MRI, TUNEL-positive cell number and LRP levels at 14 days. In addition, CDP-choline significantly increased BrdU, VEGF and synaptophysin values and decreased GFAP levels in the peri-infarct zone compared with the infarct group. In conclusion, our data indicate that CDP-choline improved functional recovery after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in association with reductions in lesion volume, cell death and LRP expression. In fact, CDP-choline increased cell proliferation, vasculogenesis and synaptophysin levels and reduced GFAP levels in the peri-infarct area of the ischemic stroke.
