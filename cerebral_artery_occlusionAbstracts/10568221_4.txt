SM-20220 (N-(aminoiminomethyl)-1-methyl-1H-indole-2-carboxamide methanesulfonate) is a Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) inhibitor which has been shown to attenuate cerebral edema in the rat transient focal ischemia model. However, to date, the effect of SM-20220 on cerebral infarction has not been examined. The present experiments were designed to investigate these effects, using both transient and permanent middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion models in rats. A dose of 1 mg/kg given intravenously 30 min after the onset of transient MCA occlusion reduced the infarcted area. In the permanent MCA occlusion model, SM-20220 reduced the infarcted area when treatment was delayed for 5, 30 or 60 min after the onset of ischemia. The present results show that NHE has a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ischemic brain damage. This NHE inhibitor may be useful for treating stroke because of its effectiveness with both forms of ischemia and because of its postischemic administration.
