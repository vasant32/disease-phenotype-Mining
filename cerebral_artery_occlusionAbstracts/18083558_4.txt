The introduction and the optimization of an alpha-amino substituent based on a series of alpha-hydroxy-beta-N-biaryl ether sulfonamide hydroxamates is described. The modification leads to a new series of MMP-2/MMP-9 inhibitors with enhanced inhibitory activities and improved ADME properties. An efficacy study on reducing the ischemia-induced brain edema in the rat transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAo) model is also demonstrated.
