OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on the expression of glucose transporter-i (GLUT-1) of hippocampal microvascular endothelial cells in focal cerebral ischemia (CI) rats. METHODS: Sixty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into sham-operation, model and electroacupuncture (EA) groups. CI model was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion with a piece of thread embolus. EA (4 Hz/20 Hz, 1 mA) was applied to bilateral "Neiguan" (PC 6) for 30 min, once daily for 15 days. GLUT-1 expression in the hippocampus was detected with immunohistochemistry and Western blot, respectively. RESULTS: After the treatment, compared with the sham-operation group, the expression of GLUT-1 in microvascular endothelial cells of the hippocampus in model group shown by both histochemical and Western blot techniques decreased apparently (P < 0.05). While in comparison with model group, the expression of GLUT-1 in EA group was upregulated significantly (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: EA of PC 6 can effectively upregulate GLUT-1 expression in the hippocampus in cerebral ischemia rats, which may contribute to its effect in improving CI by raising the glucose transportation of microvascular endothelial cells.
