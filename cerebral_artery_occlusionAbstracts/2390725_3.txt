The effects of the excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist, kynurenate, were investigated in spontaneously hypertensive rats after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Kynurenate did not significantly modify either the infarct volume, measured 48 h after occlusion, or the neurological score. The absence of a neuroprotective effect of kynurenate in this study, which contrasts with results in normotensive rats, is suggested to be due to impaired collateral circulation in spontaneously hypertensive rats.
