Effects of prolonged focal ischemia [middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)] of 1, 2, and 4 h followed by 15-h reperfusion on CBF, extracellular amino acids, purine catabolites, evoked potentials, and infarction were studied in core (A:auditory cortex) and border zone (SF: somatosensory cortex) areas of halothane-anesthetized cats. Following MCAO, CBF reduction was severe in A (<15 ml 100 g-1 min-1) and mild to moderate in SF. Prominent elevation of glutamate and abolition of evoked potentials in A contrasted with milder and more variable disturbances in SF. After reperfusion, recovery of CBF, glutamate, and evoked potentials was fast and persistent in the 1- and 2-h groups. In the 4-h group, immediate recovery of CBF, glutamate, and evoked potentials was incomplete, and secondary deterioration of all parameters was obtained at the end of the experiments. Infarction in the 4-h group was significantly larger than in the 1- and 2-h groups. Persistent recovery of extracellular glutamate concentration and electrical function and salvage of neuronal tissue from infarction therefore seem to depend on successful restoration of CBF, which in turn depends on the magnitude and the duration of CBF reduction and of exposure to potentially harmful substances such as glutamate during the ischemic attack.
