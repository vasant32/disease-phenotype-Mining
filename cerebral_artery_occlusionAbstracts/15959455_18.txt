Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-2 (PARP-2) is a member of the PARP enzyme family, and, similarly to PARP-1, catalyzes the formation of ADP-ribose polymers in response to DNA damage. While PARP-1 overactivation contributes to ischemic cell death, no information is available regarding the role of PARP-2. In this study, we evaluated the impact of PARP-2 deletion on histopathological outcome from two different experimental models of cerebral ischemia. Male PARP-2-/- mice and wild-type (WT) littermates were subjected to either 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by 22 h reperfusion, or underwent 10 mins of KCl-induced cardiac arrest (CA) followed by cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and 3-day survival. After MCAO, infarct volume was reduced in PARP-2-/- mice (38%+/-12% of contralateral hemisphere) compared with WT (64%+/-16%). After CA/CPR, PARP-2 deletion significantly increased neuronal cell loss in the hippocampal CA1 field (65%+/-36% ischemic neurons) when compared with WT mice (31%+/-33%), with no effect in either striatum or cortex. We conclude that PARP-2 is a novel executioner of cell death pathways in focal cerebral ischemia, but might be a necessary survival factor after global ischemia to mitigate hippocampal delayed cell death.
