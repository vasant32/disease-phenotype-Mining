Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a key regulator of vasculogenesis and embryonic angiogenesis, was recently found to be up-regulated in an animal model of stroke. Unlike VEGF, angiopoietin (Ang)-1 and -2, their receptor tie-2, and the associated receptor tie-1 exert their functions at later stages of vascular development, i.e., during vascular remodeling and maturation. To assess the role of the angiopoietin/tie family in ischemia-triggered angiogenesis we analyzed their temporal and spatial expression pattern after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Ang-1 mRNA was constitutively expressed in a subset of glial and neuronal cells with no apparent change in expression after MCAO. Ang-2 mRNA was up-regulated 6 hours after MCAO and was mainly observed in endothelial cell (EC) cord tips in the peri-infarct and infarct area. Up-regulation of both Ang-2 and VEGF coincided with EC proliferation. Interestingly, EC proliferation was preceded by a transient period of EC apoptosis, correlating with a change in VEGF/Ang-2 balance. Our observation of specific stages of vascular regression and growth after MCAO are in agreement with recent findings suggesting a dual role of Ang-2 in blood vessel formation, depending on the availability of VEGF.
