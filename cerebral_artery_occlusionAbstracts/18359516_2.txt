Anti-inflammatory therapy has provided hope for a new effective treatment of brain ischemic stroke. In this study, adult male Wistar rats subjected to right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 60 min were allocated to treatment of the anti-inflammatory compound alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) or saline. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histology were used to evaluate the effects of alpha-MSH. MRI volumetry was performed to measure infarct size, and MRI measurements of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were performed to evaluate changes in the extra/intracellular volume ratio. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining was used as a reference method to measure infarct sizes. The ADC value of the infarct area decreased significantly two days after MCAO in both groups. Simultaneously the infarct volume determined from the ADC map decreased in the alpha-MSH treated group compared to the control group. Five days after MCAO, ADC returned to baseline levels in both groups. The infarct volume in the alpha-MSH group was smaller compared to the saline treated group as demonstrated both by MRI and TTC staining. This study showed that the extra/intracellular ratio (reflected by ADC) following focal brain ischemic stroke could be affected by alpha-MSH. Secondly, we showed that the infarct volume was reduced by alpha-MSH. The volumetric dimensions of the infarct areas measured by MRI were comparable to those measured by histology.
