 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The identification of a neuroprotective drug for stroke remains elusive. Given that mitochondria play a key role both in maintaining cellular energetic homeostasis and in triggering the activation of cell death pathways, we evaluated the efficacy of newly identified inhibitors of cytochrome c release in hypoxia/ischemia induced cell death. We demonstrate that methazolamide and melatonin are protective in cellular and in vivo models of neuronal hypoxia. METHODS: The effects of methazolamide and melatonin were tested in oxygen/glucose deprivation-induced death of primary cerebrocortical neurons. Mitochondrial membrane potential, release of apoptogenic mitochondrial factors, pro-IL-1beta processing, and activation of caspase -1 and -3 were evaluated. Methazolamide and melatonin were also studied in a middle cerebral artery occlusion mouse model. Infarct volume, neurological function, and biochemical events were examined in the absence or presence of the 2 drugs. RESULTS: Methazolamide and melatonin inhibit oxygen/glucose deprivation-induced cell death, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of mitochondrial factors, pro-IL-1beta processing, and activation of caspase-1 and -3 in primary cerebrocortical neurons. Furthermore, they decrease infarct size and improve neurological scores after middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that methazolamide and melatonin are neuroprotective against cerebral ischemia and provide evidence of the effectiveness of a mitochondrial-based drug screen in identifying neuroprotective drugs. Given the proven human safety of melatonin and methazolamide, and their ability to cross the blood-brain-barrier, these drugs are attractive as potential novel therapies for ischemic injury.
