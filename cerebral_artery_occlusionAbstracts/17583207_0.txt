OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of cyclovirobuxinum-D (CVB-D) on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats and explore its mechanisms. METHOD: One hundred and twenty rats were randomly divided into three CVB-D groups (2, 1, 0.5 mg x kg(-1)), Nimodipine group (2 mg x kg(-1)), model group and sham operated group, 20 rats each group. Rat cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury model was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion, the nerve injury symptoms was evaluated, the level of SOD and MDA in brain tissue were determined, the concentration of intracellar Ca2+ of brain was measured, and the pathological change of brain was also observed. RESULT: CVB-D could improve the nerve injury symptoms, reduce the infarction area of brain, the concentration of intracellar Ca2+ and the level of MDA, increase the activity of SOD, and decrease the pathological change of brain. CONCLUSION: CVB-D has protective effect on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats.
