Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in response to median nerve stimulation were used as a guide to cortical function during temporary occlusion of the distal M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in the surgical treatment of five large aneurysms of the MCA bifurcation. MCA occlusion times ranged from 8 to 19 minutes under moderate hypothermia at 28.8 degrees to 30.3 degrees C. SEPs were preserved for variable times during MCA occlusion, ranging from no increase in latency after 13 minutes of occlusion to severe deterioration after 6 minutes. In no case was MCA occlusion maintained for longer than 3 minutes in the presence of a severely disturbed SEP. Recovery of the SEP to its preoperative relationship with that of the nonoperated hemisphere was seen in all cases before the end of operation. All patients were awake after rewarming at the end of operation without any neurological deficit. Monitoring the SEP pertaining to the territory of a cerebral artery during its temporary occlusion can help avoid ischemic damage and will allow the surgeon to take advantage of the several benefits of this technique in aneurysm surgery.
