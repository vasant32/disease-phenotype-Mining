It is generally accepted that N-acetylaspartate (NAA) can be used a biochemical marker for assessing neuronal viability/integrity after cerebral ischemia. However, this view has recently been questioned based on observations showing that after a photothrombotic permanent ischemia the acute decline of NAA in the infracted regions, where massive neuronal loss persists, is reversible over time. In this study, we measured the longitudinal changes of NAA and total creatine (Cr) in ischemic rat brain after a 15-min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) by in vivo (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The results showed that the levels of NAA and total Cr in the ischemic lesion decrease significantly at 1 day post-ichemia, followed by spontaneous recovery to the control levels by 2 weeks and remained stable thereafter up to 16 weeks. The normalization of NAA and total Cr levels was associated histologically with persisted neuronal loss up to 90 % in the ischemic core, and accompanied by marked reactive astrocytic responses occurring with a similar time course. The absolute T(2) relaxation time in the ischemic lesion increased during acute phase, and declined afterwards during subacute and chronic phases of 15-min MCAO. The delayed decreases of T(2) in the ischemic lesion might be associated with deposition of paramagnetic species, such as manganese and iron originated from chronic inflammation, vascular degradation and/or hemorrhagic transformation. The results of this study give further support to the hypothesis that the recovery of NAA after cerebral ischemia might have contributions from reactive glia cells, and caution the use of NAA as a specific neuronal marker during the chronic stage of cerebral ischemia.
