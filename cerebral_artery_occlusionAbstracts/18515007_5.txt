Bis(7)-tacrine, a promising anti-Alzheimer's dimer, has been shown to have multiple neuroprotective activities in vitro. Here, we investigate whether bis(7)-tacrine attenuates focal cerebral ischemic impairment in vivo. Cerebral ischemia was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by transient (2h) middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by 24h of reperfusion. Bis(7)-tacrine administered intraperitoneally 15 min after ischemia dose-dependently improved neurological behavior deficits and reduced both cerebral infarct volume and edema. The TUNEL staining assay showed that bis(7)-tacrine attenuated neuronal apoptosis in the penumbral region. Compared with that for memantine, a moderately effective N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist with a similar affinity and potency to bis(7)-tacrine in blocking NMDA receptors, the therapeutic window for bis(7)-tacrine was wider and lasted up to 6h after the onset of ischemia. Bis(7)-tacrine did not affect physiological parameters or regional cerebral blood flow during either the occlusion period or the early reperfusion stage. In conclusion, bis(7)-tacrine dose- and time-dependently protected against acute focal cerebral ischemic insults, possibly through the drug's anti-apoptotic effects during multiple events in the ischemic cascade.
