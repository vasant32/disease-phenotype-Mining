A series of novel arylpiperidines (4a-d) which have highly potent blocking effects for both neuronal Na+ and T-type Ca2+ channels with extremely low affinity for dopamine D2 receptors were synthesized. Among these compounds, 1-(2-hydroxy-3-phenoxy)propyl-4-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-piperidine hydrochloride (4c; SUN N5030) exhibited remarkable neuroprotective activity in a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model.
