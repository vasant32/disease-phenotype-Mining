DL-3-n-Butylphthalide (NBP) is a synthetic compound based on L-3-n-Butylphthalide which was isolated from seeds of Apium graveolens. The present study aims at evaluating the outcome of NBP given prior to and after the onset of ischemic stroke in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY). Stroke was induced by the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in SHR and WKY. For pre-treatment, NBP was administered to SHR and WKY daily for two months prior to MCAO. For post-treatment, NBP was given daily for seven consecutive days after MCAO. Seven days post-surgery, rats were tested for the presence of neurological deficits. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining were employed to calculate the infarct volume. The cerebral cortex and corpus striatum in the ischemic penumbra area were examined microscopically for pathological changes. In SHR, NBP pre- and post-treatment significantly lowered neurological deficit scores, reduced infarct volume, and minimized pathological changes in the penumbra area when compared to oil-vehicle treated controls. In WKY, these beneficial effects were observed only in the post-treatment group. The beneficial effects of NBP post-treatment were greater in WKY than in SHR. Results indicated that NBP could exert both preventive and therapeutic effects on ischemic stroke in SHR, but only exerted therapeutic effect in WKY.
