The cell volume is regulated not only by inorganic ions, but also by organic osmolytes, such as amino acids, methylamines, and polyhydric alcohols (polyols). Using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-NMR), we measured the tissue concentrations of amino acids (alanine, aspartate, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, glutamine, N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), taurine), methylamines (glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC), creatine+phosphocreatine (total creatine, tCr)), and polyols (myo-inositol) in the rat brain after middle cerebral artery occlusion (incomplete focal ischemia) or after decapitation (complete global ischemia). The total osmolytes expressed as a sum of total amino acids, total methylamines, and total polyols were significantly decreased at 24 h of focal ischemia (58.7% of control value, P=0.0025) whereas they were not changed following decapitation. The water content was increased from control value of 77.9%-84.1% after focal ischemia (P<0.0001) but not after decapitation. These results suggest that the brain organic osmolytes are involved in the process of edema formation following focal cerebral ischemia. Further elucidation of the cellular mechanisms regulating these organic osmolytes in cerebral ischemia may promote greater understanding of the pathophysiology involved in the evolution of brain edema.
