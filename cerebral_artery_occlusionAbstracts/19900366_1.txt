AIM: To explore the effects of adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC) transplantation on the expression of IL-10 amd TNF-alpha after cerebral ischaemia in Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats. METHODS: 72 male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: sham group, MCAO group, Vehicle group and ADSC group (n=18). Rat's cerebral ischemia model was established by MCAO with Longa's method. ADSC were labeled by DAPI before transplantation. One day after MCAO, 30 microL of cell suspension containing 1 x 10(6); ADSCs were injected into the lateral ventricle of ADSC group and the same dose of PBS was given to the Vehicle group. At day 4, day 7 and day 14 after MCAO, the rats were decapitated to detect the expression of IL-10 and TNF-alpha in ischaemic rat's brain by ELISA, immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. RESULTS: Compared with sham group, the expression of IL-10 and TNF-alpha significantly up-regulated at 4 d, 7 d of MCAO group(P<0.05). There was no statistical difference of IL-10 and TNF-alpha expression between MCAO and vehicle group ant any time point(P>0.05). Compared with Vehicle group, the expression of IL-10 significantly up-regulated while TNF-alpha expression significantly decreased of ADSC-treated group at any timepoint post MCAO(P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The transplantation of ADSC could up-regulate the expression of IL-10 and down-regulate the expression of TNF-alpha in MCAO rat's brain, which might contribute to its protective role upon cerebral ischaemia.
