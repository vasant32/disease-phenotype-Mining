Fluorine (19F) nuclear magnetic resonance may be used to image cerebral perfusion in cats receiving perfluorocarbon blood substitutes. 19F relaxation times in these blood substitutes are dependent on oxygen tension (PO2) and may be used to calculate and spatially map cerebrovascular PO2 values in vivo. We have applied this noninvasive method to experimental middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. Following MCA occlusion a perfusion defect is evident in the sylvian region, followed by the appearance of collaterals. Signal from the ipsilateral rete mirabilis is increased. Calculated cortical vascular PO2 values indicate a relative reduction in oxygenation in the ischaemic hemisphere. PO2 maps show a perfused hypoxaemic zone adjacent to the perfusion defect. These changes are partly reversed with reperfusion.
