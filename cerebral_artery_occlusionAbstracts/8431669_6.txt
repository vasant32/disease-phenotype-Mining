After transient cerebral ischemia, the brain is vulnerable to additional injury via hypoperfusion deficits. Eicosanoids with vasoconstrictor properties, such as thromboxane A2 (TxA2), may worsen postischemic hypoperfusion. The effect of temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) on brain TxB2 (the stable metabolite of TxA2) was evaluated in isoflurane-anesthetized rats. Microdialysis probes were placed in the caudate nucleus and temporal cortex. Each rat underwent one of the following ischemic regimens: groups I, II, and III--MCAo was maintained for 60, 120, and 180 min, respectively, followed by 120 min of reperfusion; group IV--a sham group in which MCAo and reperfusion were simulated; group V--7 h of MCAo only. Dialysate was measured for TxB2 by radioimmunoassay. Brain levels of TxB2 did not deviate from baseline during MCAo (or in the sham group). In contrast, during reperfusion, there was a significant increase in TxB2 following 180 min of MCAo but not after 60 or 120 min or MCAo (p < 0.05). These data indicate that, in this model of cerebral ischemia, TxB2 does not increase during MCAo. However, following a threshold duration of MCAo (180 min), the vasoconstrictor TxB2 may modulate postischemic hypoperfusion. These findings may have implications in the pharmacologic treatment of postischemic hypoperfusion and reperfusion brain injury.
