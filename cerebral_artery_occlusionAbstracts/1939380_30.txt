The effects of magnesium, an endogenous inhibitor of calcium entry into neurons, upon ischemic brain damage were investigated using a well-characterized model of focal cerebral ischemia in rats. Infarct volumes were determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride transcardiac perfusion 48 h after middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. The area of ischemic damage was quantified by image analysis in coronal sections taken every 0.5 mm. MgCl2 (1 mmol/kg) was injected intraperitoneally just after MCA occlusion and again 1 h later. Posttreatment with MgCl2 (16 control and 16 treated rats) significantly reduced the cortical infarct volume. Compensation for the hyperglycemic effect of MgCl2 with insulin (17 rats) further reduced the infarct volume in the neocortex. No systemic effects of either treatment could account for the observed neuroprotection.
