OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effects of anesthesia with ketamine and midazolam on focal cerebral ischemia injury, and evaluated the neuroprotective properties of this combination during surgical procedures. METHODS: Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) under ketamine or ketamine-midazolam intraperitoneal anesthesia (n = 15 each). The neurological scoring was performed to determine functional impairment of the brain at 4 h after MCAO. TTC staining of brain slices was used to measure infarct size of the brain at 24 h after MCAO. At day 3 after MCAO, TUNEL staining was employed to detect apoptotic cells in the penumbra. RESULTS: Although neurological scoring (1.57 +/- 0.65 vs 1.74 +/- 0.52) was not significantly different between ketamine and ketamine-midazolam groups (P > 0.05), infarct size and apoptotic cell density in the penumbra were significantly lower in the ketamine-midazolaml group than those in the ketaminel group [infarct size: (24.1 +/- 4.63)% vs (38.48 +/- 4.18)%; apoptotic cells density: (178 +/- 23) cells/mm2 vs (258 +/- 15) cells/mm2, P < 0.05], respectively. CONCLUSION: The above findings suggested that ketamine and midazolam combination might provide neuroprotection during surgical procedures that pose risk for ischemic cerebral injury.
