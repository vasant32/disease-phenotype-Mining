Conscious Wistar rats with stereotaxically and unilaterally implanted cannula just above the middle cerebral artery (MCA) were injected with the powerful vasoconstrictor peptide endothelin-1 (ET1, 60 pmol in 3 microl). The purpose was to examine the long-term (from the 1st to the 14th day) changes in neuronal bioelectrical activity together with sensorimotor deficits after ET1-induced MCA occlusion (MCAO). Extracellular multi-unit activity (MUA) recorded from the ipsilateral fronto-parietal cortical area (supplied by MCA) and sensorimotor behavior (one postural reflex test and six limb placing tests) were examined. A significant suppression of the multi-unit activity was observed until the 14th day post-ET1. The rats exhibited significant unilateral sensorimotor deficits with a maximum at the 3-7 days after ET1 and a spontaneous partial recovery by days 11-14. A significant correlation was found between the suppression of the multi-unit activity and the sensorimotor deficits between the 3rd and the 10th day post-ET1. The results suggest that studying the bioelectrical activity in combination with the behavioral sensorimotor functions may be of use to assess the functional disturbances associated with focal cerebral ischemia and would help to examine the therapeutic benefits of various cerebroprotective treatments before initiating human clinical trials.
