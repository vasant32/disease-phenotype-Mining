OBJECTIVE: To study the dynamic changes in the density of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor in different areas of rat brains during reperfusion after local ischaemia. METHODS: The rat cerebral focal ischemia/reperfusion model after middle cerebral artery occlusion was made by the intraluminal suture method. Using 3H-QNB as radioligand, after binding with M receptor on the brain slice of the rat model, the brain samples were exposed on the hypersensitive film [H-3] to complete autoradiography, and the density of M receptor in different areas on the film of autoradiography was measured. RESULTS: There were no changes in the M receptor density in 2 hours' ischaemia group and 2 hours' reperfusion group, M receptor densities in the area of occipital cortex (OC) and temporal cortex (TC) were observed to decrease significantly in 8 hours' reperfusion group, but the degree of decrease was lower than 24 hours' and 72 hours' reperfusion groups, there was significant decrease in the density of M receptor in the areas of caudate putamen (CP), frontal cortex (FC), TC, OC of the 24 hours' and 72 hours' reperfusion groups and no difference was found between these two groups, and the imaging of M receptor in the domains with decreased receptor was obvious. CONCLUSIONS: The quantity of M receptor did not change right after ischaemia or reperfusion. It decreased gradually after an interval of time; Imaging of the M receptor could assess the changes of the density of viable cholinergic neurons and be a marker of diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis of brain ischaemia.
