 OBJECTIVES: The present study investigated the effects of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) on cerebral infarction after transient focal ischemia in rats. METHODS: Focal ischemia (1Â·5 hours) was created in male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-280 g)  by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Some rats were treated with 20 mg/kg tetrahydrobiopterin by intraperitoneal injection 30 minutes before reperfusion. At 2, 6, and 12 hours of reperfusion, the brains were harvested for the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity and nitric oxide (NO) level  assays. At 12 hours of reperfusion, the brains were harvested for infarct size measurement. RESULTS: NOS activity and NO level were all augmented after reperfusion. BH4 treatment significantly further increased NOS activity and NO level. Cerebral infarct size was significantly bigger  in BH4 treatment group compared to that in no treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that BH4 enhances cerebral infarction after transient focal ischemia in rats, through NOS and NO pathway.
