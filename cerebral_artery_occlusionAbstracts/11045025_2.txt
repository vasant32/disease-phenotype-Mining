Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 87) weighing 350-400 g were used for studying the anatomy of the horizontal segment of middle cerebral artery and infarct area after occlusion of the artery. In the experimental group (n = 27) middle cerebral artery was coagulated 3-4 mm length from the origin of the lateral striate arteries to the inferior cerebral vein and divided. Control rats (n = 20) had all the surgical procedures except occlusion. Another group of rats (n = 40) were used to determine the anatomical variations of middle cerebral artery after intracarotid carbon black injection. Five major patterns of middle cerebral artery were observed and two of them were major and constituted 92.5% of rats. Twenty-four hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion, all animals were neurologically evaluated. On the third day after occlusion the brains were stained with 2%, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrozolium chloride. The area of infarction was assessed by computerized analysis method. In our study after determining the variations of the middle cerebral artery and its branches in our strain of rats, we were able to achieve 92.5% grade III and IV infarcted area.
