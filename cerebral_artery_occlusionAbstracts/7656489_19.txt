The aim of this investigation was to assess the use of cerebral extracellular glucose as a parameter for microdialytic monitoring in neurosurgical critical care patients. Samples were collected from four patients with severe head injury and one with subarachnoid haemorrhage for periods of 4.5-67 h. Glucose and lactate were analysed in the dialysates. The ratios of glucose to lactate were calculated to partially allow for changes in microdialytic conditions over time. On-line pH was measured for up to 3 days in three patients. In experiments with spontaneous hypertensive rats we found that extracellular glucose became unmeasurable in the ischemic zone after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Similarly, in 3 patients glucose became undetectable for several hours, and glucose/lactate tended to decrease during measurement. This was accompanied by high ICP in one patient, and by a hypoxic episode in another. In the two other patients glucose/lactate ratios showed a rising trend. Findings indicate that glucose, and the glucose/lactate ratio show some correlations with clinical course and are promising parameters for cerebral monitoring and therapeutic decision making.
