This study examined the effect of Natrii sulfas, a treatment for stroke patients suffering constipation in Oriental medicine, on the physiological indices and brain edema of rats. Brain edema was induced by a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), Natrii sulfas was administered after the MCAO. At 3, 6, 15, 24, and 48 hours after reperfusion, the physiological indices such as the fecal weight, urine volume and water content in the stools were assessed. The edema index was measured 48 hours after reperfusion. At 48 hours, the expressions of iNOS, MMP9, VEGF, GFAP, Bax, Bcl-2, c-Fos, and HSP72 positive astrocytes were observed on the brain tissues by immunohistochemistry. Natrii sulfas significantly improved the decrease in fecal weight, urine volume and water content in the stool caused by the ischemic insult (p < 0.05) and attenuated the brain edema caused by the ischemia insult (p < 0.05). Natrii sulfas significantly down-regulated iNOS and MMP9 expressions and attenuated the astrocyte swelling due to brain edema in the penumbra of the cerebral cortex of MCAO rats. Natrii sulfas reduced the excess Bax and HSP72 expressions in ischemic brain, which was statistically significant in the penumbra of the cerebral cortex but not in the caudate putamen. These results suggest Natrii sulfas has a protective effect on ischemia-induced brain edema and improves the physiological symptoms.
