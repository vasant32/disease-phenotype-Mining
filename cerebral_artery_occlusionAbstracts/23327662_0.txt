Abstract This study was to investigate the protective effect of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-7 (rhBMP-7) on focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injuries and their underlying mechanisms. An intraluminal suture method was used to generate a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in rats, which was followed by reperfusion. A sham operation (SO) group underwent the procedure without occlusion, while an ischemia-reperfusion group (IR) and rhBMP-7 treated group (RT) underwent occlusion in the absence and presence of rhBMP-7 (250 μg/kg) administered via a femoral vein injection 30 min prior to reperfusion. Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, neurological function, brain water content, and morphological alterations were examined. Apoptosis was detected using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays, and immunohistochemical staining and western blot assays were used to detect nuclear NF-κB p65 expression. Compared with the SO group, IR rats showed a decrease in neurological function, an increase in brain water content, and pathological and morphological damage (p < 0.05). Higher levels of apoptosis were also detected in the infarct region area. In contrast, RT rats had reduced injury following ischemia-reperfusion. In addition, while immunohistochemical staining and western blot assays consistently detected increased expression of nuclear NF-κB following ischemia reperfusion, these levels were reduced in the RT group. Administration of rhBMP-7 prior to reperfusion effectively inhibited the extent of ischemia-reperfusion injury by attenuating cerebral edema and ameliorating ultrastructural damage. The underlying mechanisms responsible for these observations potentially involve the inhibition of apoptosis induced by ischemia-reperfusion by rhBMP-7 via an NF-κB-related signaling cascade.
