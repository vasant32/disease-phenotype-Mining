1. We have investigated the ability of several compounds to diminish both infarct area and volume induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion in the mouse. 2. Lifarizine, ipsapirone and N,N-diethyl-2-[4-(phenylmethyl)phenoxy]ethanamine HCl (DPPE) all reduced both infarct area and volume. Ifenprodil diminished the infarct area, but the effect on total infarct volume was much less pronounced. 3. In addition, we tested the protective effects of some other drugs on infarct area only. Nimodipine, verapamil, diltiazem, N-[1-[4-(4-fluorophenoxy)butyl]-4-piperidinyl]-N-methyl-2-benzothiazo lamine (R56865) and sabeluzole had no effect on infarct area. (S)-Emopamil significantly diminished infarct area. 2,3-Dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(F)quinoxaline (NBQX) also diminished infarct area significantly. 4. In some brain ischemia models hypothermia protects against ischemic damage. Mild hypothermia had no effect on infarct area in the present mouse model of focal ischemia.
