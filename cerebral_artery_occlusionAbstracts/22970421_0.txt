Early spontaneous recanalization of the middle cerebral artery in acute ischemic phase artery is not uncommon, whereas the late spontaneous recanalization of chronic occluded artery is a very rare phenomenon and exact incidence and the timing of this event have not been quantified. We present a case in which late spontaneous recanalization of long-lasting middle cerebral artery occlusion occurred in the absence of surgical, endovascular and thrombolytic treatments.
