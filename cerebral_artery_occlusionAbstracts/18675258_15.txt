Cell therapy is prospective, modern attempt to ischemic stroke treatment. It has been being widely worked out recently. We suggest mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) as a cell therapy agent in the therapy of this disease. Experiments were carried out in inbred male Wistar-Kyoto rats. Animals were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). MSCs were isolated from rat bone marrow, expanded in culture and labelled with vital fluorescent dye PKH-26. Then 5 x 10(6) cells were injected into the tail vein on the day of MCAO and three days later. Control group animals received PBS injection (negative control). Cognitive function restoration was estimated by Morris Water Maze testing during 6 weeks after MCAO. Animals were sacrificed 1, 2, 3, 5 days and 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks after operation. Intravenous MSC transplantation decreased post-operation mortality and benefited behavioural and neurological recovery. Experimental groups animals revealed changes in aseptic inflammation processes which were completed faster comparing to control group. That effect correlated with accelerated glial scar formation. Reduction of the infarct volumes and such post-stroke after-effects as border zone gliosis and liquor cysts formation accompanied by increased angiogenesis and subventricular zone cells proliferation were shown after cell therapy. The obtained results referred to both cell therapy groups. Thus, MSC injection benefited post-stroke rehabilitation irrespective of transplantation time. However, further investigation should be carried out in order to find out the mechanism of their action.
