This study examined c-fos protein expression in the brain and spinal cord of rats following permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) above the rhinal fissure. At 1 h after right-sided MCA occlusion, Fos-like immunoreactivity (Fos-LI) was detected in neurons not only in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex but also in the spinal cord. In the latter, Fos-LI was localized in the nucleus and perikarya of neurons in the grey matter, notably the large motor neurons in the ventral horn. Fos-LI was most intense at 2-4 h, but became undetectable after 48 h in the cerebral cortex and 72 h in the spinal cord. In sham-operated animals, Fos-LI was almost undetectable or virtually absent. It was also not detected in the core territory supplied by the MCA at any time points after arterial occlusion. When the ischaemia-induced neuronal damage in both the cerebral cortex and spinal cord was evaluated by Nissl staining, some neurons appeared atrophic. We conclude that the induction of Fos-LI in neurons of the cerebral cortex and spinal cord is linked respectively to early onset-short stimulation and persistent excitatory or disinhibition phenomenon as a result of focal ischaemic brain injury.
