Previous studies reported that pentoxifylline (PTX) have a neuroprotective effect in the brain trauma and the global cerebral ischemia in the experimental models. However, the effect of PTX in transient model of focal cerebral ischemia has not been investigated yet. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the effect of post-ischemic treatment of PTX on ischemic injuries in focal cerebral ischemic. Male Wistar rats (n=32) were assigned to control or PTX- (60 mg/kg i.p.) treated groups. PTX at dose 60 mg/kg i.p. administered at the beginning, or 1, or 3 h after ischemia. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion, followed by 24-h reperfusion. At the end of 24 h ischemia, neurological dysfunction score was tested and infarct volumes were determined using triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. Administration of PTX (60 mg/kg) at the beginning of ischemia, or 1, or 3 h after ischemia significantly reduces cortical infarct volumes by 43%, 40% and 41%, respectively. However, PTX did not significantly affect striatal infarct volumes and neurological dysfunction. The findings of the present study indicate that administration of PTX at least 3 h post-transient focal stroke reduces cortical brain ischemic damage in the rat model of transient focal cerebral ischemia.
