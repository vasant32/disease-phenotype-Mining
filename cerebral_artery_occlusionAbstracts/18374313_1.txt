Experimental evidence suggests that reactive free radicals are generated during brain ischemia. We investigated the effect of a novel brain penetrant, low molecular weight, non-peptidyl carbon, oxygen- and nitrogen-centered radical scavenger, IAC, on infarct volume and sensory-motor performance in a rat transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model (tMCAO). Rats received 90 min tMCAO and treated with i.p. or i.v. injections of vehicle or IAC following tMCAO. Sensory-motor performance was evaluated by neuroscore tests (NS). Cerebral infarct volume was evaluated at 72 h after tMCAO. Rats treated with IAC i.p. (1 or 6 h after the onset of tMCAO) or i.v. (1 h after the onset of tMCAO) showed significant improvement in NS during the 3 or 21 day follow-up period when compared to vehicle treated rats. Cerebral infarct volumes were significantly decreased compared to vehicle in rats receiving IAC i.p. 1 h or 6 h after occlusion, approximately 30.5% decrease compared to vehicle, or i.v. 1 h after the onset of tMCAO, 48.6% decrease compared to vehicle. These results demonstrate that IAC has neuroprotective properties with a wide therapeutic window following tMCAO in rats. IAC could therefore be a candidate for the treatment of stroke.
