This study examined the relationship between magnetic resonance diffusion imaging and autoradiographic markers of cerebral blood flow (99mTc-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime) and cerebral hypoxia (125I-iodoazomycin arabinoside) in a rat model of stroke. Middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat was performed using an intraluminal suture approach. Diffusion, hypoxia, and blood flow maps were acquired 2 hr following occlusion, and were compared with T2 images and histology at 7 hr. Two hours following middle cerebral artery occlusion the lesion distributions from the diffusion maps and hypoxic autoradiographs were similar. The blood flow threshold for increased uptake of the hypoxic marker was approximately 34 +/- 7% of the normal flow. The combination of diffusion or hypoxic images with perfusion maps allowed differentiation between four regions: 1) normal tissue; 2) a region of decreased perfusion but normal diffusion and normal uptake of hypoxic marker; 3) a region of decreased perfusion, decreased diffusion and increased uptake of hypoxic marker; 4) a region of decreased perfusion, decreased diffusion and low uptake of hypoxic marker. The areas for increased uptake of hypoxic marker and decreased diffusion are equivalent, indicating similar blood flow thresholds. Regions of oligaemic misery perfusion, ischaemic misery perfusion and lesion core may be delineated with the combination of diffusion or hypoxic images and perfusion maps.
