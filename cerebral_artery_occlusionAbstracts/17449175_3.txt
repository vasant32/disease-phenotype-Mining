Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) enhances the survival and stimulates the proliferation of neutrophil progenitors. Recently, the neurogenerative effect of G-CSF has been intensely investigated. In this study, we explored the possibility that G-CSF enhanced the cell proliferation in the rat dentate gyrus (DG) after focal cerebral ischemia, using a rat transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model. At 7 days after tMCAO, the number of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells in the G-CSF-treated group was significantly increased compared with that in the vehicle-treated group in the ipsilateral SGZ (16.6+/-5.5/mm(2) in the vehicle-treated group versus 33.0+/-7.2/mm(2) in the G-CSF-treated group, **p<0.01) and in the ipsilateral GCL (14.2+/-2.8/mm(2) in the vehicle-treated group versus 21.0+/-3.8/mm(2) in the G-CSF-treated group, *p<0.05). This result showed the possibility of a neurogenerative role of G-CSF after tMCAO in rats.
