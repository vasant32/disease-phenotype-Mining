We evaluated the effects of neural progenitor cell treatment of stroke on white matter reorganization using MRI. Male Wistar rats (n = 26) were subjected to 3 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion and were treated with neural progenitor cells (n = 17) or without treatment (n = 9) and were sacrificed at 5-7 weeks thereafter. MRI measurements revealed that grafted neural progenitor cells selectively migrated towards the ischemic boundary regions. White matter reorganization, confirmed histologically, was coincident with increases of fractional anisotropy (FA, P < 0.01) after stroke in the ischemic recovery regions compared to that in the ischemic core region in both treated and control groups. Immunoreactive staining showed axonal projections emanating from neurons and extruding from the corpus callosum into the ipsilateral striatum bounding the lesion areas after stroke. Fiber tracking (FT) maps derived from diffusion tensor imaging revealed similar orientation patterns to the immunohistological results. Complementary measurements in stroke patients indicated that FT maps exhibit an overall orientation parallel to the lesion boundary. Our data demonstrate that FA and FT identify and characterize cerebral tissue undergoing white matter reorganization after stroke and treatment with neural progenitor cells.
