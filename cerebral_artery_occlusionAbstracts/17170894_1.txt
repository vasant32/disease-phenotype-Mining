Given the poor natural history of untreated symptomatic acute middle cerebral artery occlusion, we have attempted emergent reperfusion in all three cases of acute embolic middle cerebral artery occlusion seen on our cranial base service over the last 10 years. One patient developed a massive stroke requiring a life-saving "strokectomy" within 48 hours, which left him permanently hemiplegic, hemianopic, and hemihypesthetic after a failed attempt at reperfusion by superselective endovascular injection of urokinase. The other two patients, who were aphasic and densely hemiparetic, underwent successful emergent embolectomy with reperfusion established within 5 and 12 hours, respectively. One of the two is now neurologically normal, and the second is left with a subtle monoparesis but is independent in activities of daily living. Since middle cerebral artery embolism in cranial base patients usually occurs in a closely monitored hospital setting, we are presented with a unique opportunity for early successful operative intervention. Principles for optimizing outcome include: early recognition and diagnosis, maximization of medical therapy during the diagnostic workup prior to embolectomy (induced hypertension, intravascular volume expansion, and pharmacologic cerebral metabolic demand reduction), confirmation that the involved region does not have absent blood flow by xenon/computed tomography, early operative intervention, and careful surgical technique.
