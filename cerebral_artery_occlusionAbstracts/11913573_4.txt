Cerebral infarction is a rare complication of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. In all cases previously reported in the literature, vascular occlusion occurred in the anterior brain circulation, either the internal carotid or the middle cerebral artery. We report a case of a child with posterior cerebral artery occlusion and resultant hemiparesis associated with M. pneumoniae infection.
