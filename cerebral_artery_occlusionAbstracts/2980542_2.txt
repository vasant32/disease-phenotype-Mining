Combined magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) were employed to evaluate acute regional cerebral ischemia in cats following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). MRI changes were first reliable 3 hours after MCAO; progressive increases in T1 and T2 relaxation times were noted for 12 hours after MCAO. Immediately after MCAO, 31P-MRS revealed decreased phosphocreatine (PCr) and increased inorganic phosphate (Pi); the PCr/Pi ratio fell from 2.23 +/- 0.40 to 0.68 +/- 0.04 (p less than 0.005). This relative decrease in high energy phosphates improved significantly by 3-5 hours after MCAO (0.67 +/- 0.04 versus 1.00 +/- 0.03, p less than 0.001). By 12 hours, the ratio had increased by 27 per cent. The dissociation between the progressive MRI changes and the gradual improvement in 31P-MRS suggests a difference between the processes affecting proton distribution and phosphate metabolism in acute regional ischemia.
