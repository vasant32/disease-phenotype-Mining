 PURPOSE: Phosphodiesterase 5A (PDE5A) inhibitors improve functional recovery in experimental models of stroke in rats when treatment is delayed and without effect on infarct volume. PDE5A is expressed to only a very limited extent in forebrain tissues, raising the possibility that the locus of effect for the inhibitors is outside the brain. To start to address this question, we determined whether PDE5A inhibitors must have the ability to cross the blood brain barrier to improve recovery. METHOD: After permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats, PF-5 and UK-489,791, PDE5A inhibitors that do or do not pass the blood brain barrier, were administered starting 24 h after occlusion and continued for 1 week. Motor function was assessed at intervals to 28 days using body swing and limb placement measures. RESULTS: Both PF-5 and UK-489,791 produced improvement in motor scores over 28 days that were significantly greater than in vehicle treated animals. There was no difference in efficacy between the two PDE5A inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Brain penetrability appears not to be critical to the ability of a PDE5A inhibitor to improve functional recovery after experimental stroke in rats. This finding is discussed with regard to the cellular target(s) for PDE5A inhibitors mediating this effect.
