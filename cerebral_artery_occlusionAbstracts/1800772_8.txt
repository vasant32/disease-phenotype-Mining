Cortical focal ischemia in the rat was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) together with permanent occlusion of the ipsilateral common carotid artery (CCAo) and a temporary (1 hr) occlusion of the contralateral CCA. By using a defined cortical tissue sampling procedure at 3, 6, 24, 72, 96, and 120 hr after the MCAo + CCAo, patterns of edema and ion (Na+, K+, and Ca++) changes in a primary and three peri-ischemic cortical areas are described. Ionic imbalances and edema formation have distinct patterns, are time dependent, and are different when comparing primary and peri-ischemic areas. Calcium increases to "neurotoxic" levels appear temporally independent of edema formation, reaching magnitudes 20 times greater than basal levels in the primary infarct area. Na+ increases correlate with increases in water, while K+ losses do not appear to be directly related to edema formation of Na+ and Ca++ increases. K+ losses are only significant in the primary infarct area. Rats treated with GM1 ganglioside (10 mg/kg, i.m.) daily showed significant reductions in edema, Na+ and Ca++ increases. These ganglioside effects were evident as early as 24 hr after the ischemic injury. Ca++ increases, which was maximal at 72 hr after the ischemic injury, was reduced by greater than 50% in GM1-treated animals. The mechanism by which GM1 is an effective neuroprotective agent may be evidenced by its effects on Ca++ influx/efflux processes in injury.
