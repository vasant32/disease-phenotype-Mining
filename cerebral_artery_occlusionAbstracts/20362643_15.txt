To develop an effective neuroprotective strategy against ischemic injury, it is important to identify the key molecules involved in the progression of injury. Direct molecular analysis of tissue using mass spectrometry (MS) is a subject of much interest in the field of metabolomics. Most notably, imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) allows visualization of molecular distributions on the tissue surface. To understand lipid dynamics during ischemic injury, we performed IMS analysis on rat brain tissue sections with focal cerebral ischemia. Sprague-Dawley rats were sacrificed at 24 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion, and brain sections were prepared. IMS analyses were conducted using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF MS) in positive ion mode. To determine the molecular structures, the detected ions were subjected to tandem MS. The intensity counts of the ion signals of m/z 798.5 and m/z 760.5 that are revealed to be a phosphatidylcholine, PC (16:0/18:1) are reduced in the area of focal cerebral ischemia as compared to the normal cerebral area. In contrast, the signal of m/z 496.3, identified as a lyso-phosphatidylcholine, LPC (16:0), was clearly increased in the area of focal cerebral ischemia. In IMS analyses, changes of PC (16:0/18:1) and LPC (16:0) are observed beyond the border of the injured area. Together with previous reports--that PCs are hydrolyzed by phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) and produce LPCs,--our present results suggest that LPC (16:0) is generated during the injury process after cerebral ischemia, presumably via PLA(2) activation, and that PC (16:0/18:1) is one of its precursor molecules.
