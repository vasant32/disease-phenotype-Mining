 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the protective effect of cilostazol administrated intranasally on chronic injury after focal cerebral ischemia in mice. METHODS: Focal cerebral ischemia in mice was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Cilostazol was administrated intranasally or intraperitoneally 1 h, 4 h and 7 h after the operation; then twice a day from the second day for 2 weeks. The neurological deficit scoring and the inclined board testing were performed within 35 d after ischemia. The survival rate, infarct volume and neuron density were assessed 35 d after ischemia. RESULT: Intranasal cilostazol at 0.3 mg/kg increased the survival rate. Intranasal cilostazol (0.3 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg) and intraperitoneal cilostazol (10 mg/kg) significantly attenuated neurological deficit, reduced infarct volume, and increased the survival neuron density in the border of ischemia region. CONCLUSION: Cilostazol administered intranasally demonstrates protective effects on chronic cerebral ischemia in mice.
