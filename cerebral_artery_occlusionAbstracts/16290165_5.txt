A new series of 1,4-benzoxazepine derivatives was designed, synthesized, and evaluated for binding to 5-HT1A receptor and cerebral anti-ischemic effect. A lot of compounds exhibited nanomolar affinity for 5-HT1A receptor with good selectivity over both dopamine D2 and alpha1-adrenergic receptors. Among these compounds, 3-chloro-4-[4-[4-(2-pyridinyl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-1-yl]butyl]-1, 4-benzoxazepin-5(4H)-one (50: SUN N4057 (Piclozotan) as 2HCl salt) showed remarkable neuroprotective activity in a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (t-MCAO) model.
