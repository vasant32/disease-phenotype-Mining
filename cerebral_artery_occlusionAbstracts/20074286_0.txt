BACKGROUND: In patients with acute middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion, recanalization rates with intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) are limited. Aim- We evaluated the feasibility and safety of combined IV thrombolysis with abciximab and reduced dose rtPA in a 3- to 6-h time window. METHODS: We prospectively (March 2002 to February 2005) studied patients with symptomatic MCA occlusion on computed tomography (CT) angiography and absence of major early ischemic changes (EIC) on non-contrast CT (NCCT) within 3-6 h from symptom onset. Patients were treated with IV abciximab and half-standard dose rtPA. Outcome parameters were symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), early clinical improvement and functional independence at discharge (modified Rankin Scale score < or = 2). RESULTS: Of 13 patients, mean age was 62 +/- 11 years, onset-to-treatment time 4.8 +/- 0.9 h and median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 11 (interquartile range 6.5-13.5). sICH occurred in one patient (8%). We observed early clinical improvement in four patients (31%). Six patients (46%) were functionally independent at discharge. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute symptomatic MCA occlusion and absence of major EIC on NCCT, combined IV thrombolysis with abciximab and half-standard dose rtPA was feasible and seemed to be safe if applied within 3-6 h from symptom onset.
