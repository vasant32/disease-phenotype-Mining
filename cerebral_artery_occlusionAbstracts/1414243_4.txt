The effect of global immunosuppression by sublethal whole body X-irradiation on the development of cerebral oedema was assessed 24 h after right middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat. Irradiation produced a significant leukopenia and thrombocytopaenia, and significantly reduced cortical oedema when compared to non-irradiated control animals.
