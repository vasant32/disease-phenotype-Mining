Angiotensin II (Ang II) type 2 receptors (AT2Rs) have been associated with apoptosis. We hypothesized that AT2Rs are increased in stroke and may contribute effects of stroke to the brain. To test this, we have examined the expression of Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R), AT2R and Ang II levels in the brain 24 h after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The densities of AT1R and AT2R were measured by quantitative autoradiography (n=6). The levels of Ang II were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) (n=6) and by immunohistochemistry (n=3). AT1R levels on autoradiography showed a significant decrease (0.87+/-0.06 to 1.39+/-0.07 fmol/mg, p<0.01) in the ventral cortex of the stroke side compared to the cortices of non-stroke (NS) rats (n=4). There was no significant difference on ATIR in the contralateral verbal cortex of the stroke rats compared to NS control. In contrast, levels of AT2R in the ventral cortex of both the stroke and the contralateral sides were significantly increased (0.77+/-0.06, p<0.05 and 0.91+/-0.05, p<0.01 compared to 0.60+/-0.03 fmol/mg tissue, respectively). RIA showed that Ang II in the ventral cortex of both the stroke and the contralateral sides were significantly increased (241.63+/-47.72, p<0.01 and 165.51+/-42.59, p<0.05 compared to 76.80+/-4.10 pg/g tissue, respectively). Also, Ang II in the hypothalamus was significantly increased (179.50+/-17.49 to 118.50+/-6.65 pg/g tissue, p<0.05). Immunohistochemistry confirmed the increase of Ang II. These results demonstrate that brain Ang II and AT2Rs are increased whereas AT1Rs are decreased after transient MCAO in rats. We conclude that in stroke, Ang II and AT2R are activated and may contribute neural effects to brain ischemia.
