The functional integrity of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor complex following focal cerebral ischemia in the rat has been examined at a time when brain tissue is irreversibly damaged. Twelve hours after unilateral permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion, [3H]-MK-801 binding was not significantly altered in the ischemic cerebral cortex compared to sham-operated animals. Moreover, the enhancement of [3H]MK-801 binding by exogenous glutamate was preserved in an area of the brain that was permanently damaged by the ischemic insult.
