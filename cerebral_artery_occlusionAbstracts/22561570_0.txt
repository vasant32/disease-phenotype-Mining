 OBJECTIVE: To explore the impact on cerebral protection of Trichostatin A (TSA) preconditioning in rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO); the relationship between cerebral protection of TSA and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β); and the impact of age on the mechanism of cerebral protection of TSA. METHODS: The modified suture method was used to create stable a MCAO model. A total of 96 male SD rats were assigned randomly to four groups: a control group, a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) preconditioned group, a low-dose (0.03 mg/kg) TSA-preconditioned group, and a high-dose (0.1 mg/kg) TSA-preconditioned group. Each group included four sub-groups for reperfusion for 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours, respectively, 6 rats per sub-group. An additional, eighteen healthy, male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats that received TSA preconditioning (0.1 mg/kg) were divided into three groups based on their age: young, mid-age, and old, One-way analysis of variance was used to compare the differences between groups, and the Spearman rank correlation was used to examine relationships between IL-1β concentrations in blood and cerebrospinal fluid and cerebral infarction volume. RESULTS: The cerebral infarction volume of rats in the high-dose TSA group was less than that of the other 3 groups (P<0.05). The IL-1β in blood and the cerebrospinal fluid of rats in the highdose TSA group was lower than that in control and DMSO groups (P<0.05); for the low-dose TSA group IL-1β levels were statistically the same as in controls. The Spearman rank coefficients were 0.841 and 0.618 for cerebral infarction volume correlate to blood IL-1β and to cerebrospinal fluid IL-1β, respectively (P<0.05). No statistical differences were found in cerebral infarction volume and IL-1β levels in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: High-dose TSA preconditioning reduces cerebral infarction volume and decreases IL- 1β levels in blood and cerebrospinal fluid; age does not affect these parameters.
