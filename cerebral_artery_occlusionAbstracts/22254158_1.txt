In this study, expressions of aquaporin (AQP) 1, AQP4, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and vascular endothelial growth factor in blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier and blood-brain barrier (BBB) are examined in rat choroid plexus and peri-infarcted hippocampal formation (HF) following systemic hyponatremia (SH) and permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). These events are thought to cause the development of hydrocephalic and vasogenic edemas. The importance of CSF overproduction and intact blood-CSF barrier during hydrocephalic edema formation is demonstrated by the high expression of AQP1 (329.86±10.2%, n=4 , P<0.01) and trapped plasma immunoglobulin G (IgG) in choroid plexus epithelium after 24 hours of SH. However, the increased eNOS expression in peri-infarcted HF (130±3%, n=4, P<0.01) and extravasation of plasma IgG into the extravascular compartment after 24 hours of pMCAO suggest that increased microvascular permeability, probably due to elevated levels of nitric oxide, leads to development of vasogenic brain edema via BBB breakdown. Based on these findings, the authors suggest that modulation of different protein expression, dependent on the type of brain edema, is required for primary (pMCAO) and secondary (SH) brain injuries to attenuate brain edema and neuronal degeneration.
