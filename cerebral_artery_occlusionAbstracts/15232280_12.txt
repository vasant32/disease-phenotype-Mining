The present study examined the neuroprotective effects of choroid plexus isolated from adult rats and encapsulated within alginate microcapsules. In vitro, conditioned media from cultured choroid plexus produced a marked, dose-dependent protection of embryonic cortical neurons against serum deprivation-induced cell death. In vivo studies demonstrated that a one-hour middle cerebral artery occlusion in adult Wistar rats produced profound motor and neurological impairments 1-3 days after stroke. In contrast, stroke animals transplanted with encapsulated choroid plexus cells displayed a significant reduction in both motor and neurological abnormalities. Histological analysis 3 days post-transplantation revealed that choroid plexus transplants significantly decreased the volume of striatal infarction. This is the first report demonstrating the therapeutic potential of transplanted choroid plexus for stroke.
