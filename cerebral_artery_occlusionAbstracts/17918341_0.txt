Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-based therapy is a promising modern attempt to improve the recovery after stroke. Experiments were carried out on inbred Wistar-Kyoto rats. MSCs were isolated, expanded in cultute and labeled with vital fluorescent dye PKH-26. Animals were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), followed by injection of 5 x 10(6) rat MSCs into the tail vein 3 days after MCAO. Control group animals received PBS injection (negative control). Therapy results were estimated by the following parameters: behavioral and neurological testing, the brain injure area, the state of damaged region "border" zone and the vessels quantity in the "borden" area. It was shown that control group animals (PBS injection) did not restore their initial behavioral and neurological state, while the experimental group animals (MSCs injection) showed the same parameters as intact rats at 2-3 weeks after MCAO. The size of the damaged region in the control group was approximately 1.5 as large as in the experimental group. The damage in the experimental group was limited to neocortex; caudate nucleus, capsula externa and piriform cortex remained uninjured. Small vessels quantity in the "border" regions was twine higher compared to control group and was approximately equal to an intact brain vessel number. Moreover, it was shown for the first time that after MSCs transplantation the vessels quantity in the neocortex and caudate putamen of contralateral hemisphere was twice as much as in control. We demonstrated that the MSCs transplantation definitely exerted a positive influence upon the brain tissue reparation after stroke.
