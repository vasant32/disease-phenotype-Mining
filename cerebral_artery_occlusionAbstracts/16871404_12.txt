Whether cannabinoids act as neuroprotectants or, on the contrary, even worsen neuronal damage after cerebral ischemia is currently under discussion. We have previously shown that treatment with the cannabinoid (CB1) receptor antagonist SR141716A reduces infarct volume by approximately 40% after experimental stroke. Since it is suggested that SR141716A may exert neuroprotection besides its cannabinoid receptor-blocking effect, we addressed the question whether SR141716A may act via modulation of postischemic ligand binding to excitatory NMDA and/or alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-proprionic acid (AMPA) receptors. For this purpose, rats (n = 12) were treated with either intravenous saline (control) or CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A (1 mg/kg) 30 min after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion. Five hours after ischemia, quantitative receptor autoradiography was performed using [(3)H]CP 55,940, [(3)H]MK-801, and [(3)H]AMPA for labeling of CB1, NMDA, and AMPA receptors, respectively. Ligand binding was analyzed within the infarct core, cortical penumbra, and corresponding areas of the contralateral hemisphere and compared to that of sham-operated rats (n = 5). Both in ischemic controls and SR141716A-treated rats [(3)H]CP 55,940 ligand binding was not specifically regulated in the cortical penumbra or contralateral cortex. Importantly, reduced infarct volumes in SR141716A-treated rats were associated with maintained [(3)H]MK-801 binding to excitotoxic NMDA receptors in the penumbra, compared to a decrease in the control group. In summary, our data suggest that SR141716A may possess additional intrinsic neuroprotective properties independent of receptor-coupled pathways or due to action as a partial agonist.
