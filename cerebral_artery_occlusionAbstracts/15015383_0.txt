OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of Naosaitong (NST) on the cerebral blood flow (CBF), the infarct areas and blood rheology in animals. METHOD: NST's cerebral protective effects were investigated by using middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), bilateral common carotid artery ligation, and carrogeenin-induced thrombus model rats, being administrated with medicine for seven days. RESULTS: Three dosage groups of NST increased CBF in anesthetized rabbits, reduced the infarct areas in MCAO rats, decreased the physical sign indexes, and water quantities. They increased the activities of Glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and Catalase (CAT), decreased the contractions of Lipid peroxidase (LPO) and Lactate (LD) in the cerebral ischemia-reperfusion rats; shortened the length of thrombus and improved the blood rheology in the carrogeenin-induced thrombus model rats, and prolonged hypoxia-resisting time in mice. CONCLUSION: NST can evidently increase CBF in rabbits, improve the cerebral edema brain tissues' injure and nervous physical sign indexes in the cerebral ischemia-reperfusion rats, reduce the infarct areas in MCAO rats, postpone thrombosis course and have antioxidation effects, which show that NST can obviously protect the brain tissues in the experimental cerebral infarct model rats.
