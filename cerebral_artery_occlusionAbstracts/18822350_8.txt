Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a very important mitogenic factor with proved neurogenesis effects in the central nervous system. Intranasal administration can bypass blood-brain barrier and deliver drugs into the brain directly. We investigated whether intranasal administration of bFGF at later time points after ischemia could promote adult neurogenesis and improve neurologic functions. Rats received bFGF or saline intranasally once daily for 6 consecutive days, starting at 1 day after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected at 5 and 6 days after MCAO. Rats were killed at 7 or 28 days after MCAO. Neurogenesis was assessed by immunostaining for BrdU and cell type-specific markers. Neurological functions were evaluated by the modified Neurological Severity Scores. Compared with the control animals, intranasal administration of bFGF improved behavioral recovery without affecting infarct size, and enhanced proliferation of progenitor cells in the subventricular zone and the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus (DG). Furthermore, the new proliferated cells could differentiate into neurons (BrdU+NeuN+ cells) in the striatum and DG at 28 days after MCAO. Intranasal administration of bFGF offers a non-invasive alternative for the treatment of stroke.
