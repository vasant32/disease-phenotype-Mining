The effects of brain ischemia and reperfusion on smooth muscle function in remote cerebral and peripheral arteries are hardly known. Maximum vasoconstrictions (E(max)) caused by 120mmol/l KCl and 5-HT in endothelium-denuded ring preparations were measured in ischemic and control cerebral arteries of rats after a 1-h right middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by 0-min (I/NR) or 2-3-min (I/SR) reperfusion, and in peripheral arteries after I/SR. Surprisingly, vasoconstrictions to 5-HT and 120mmol/lK(+) were attenuated in remote brain vessels after I/SR, i.e. in the contralateral middle cerebral artery and the basilar artery, while I/NR depressed E(max) of 5-HT and high KCl only in the ischemic middle cerebral artery. Pretreatment with N-(2-mercaptopropionyl) glycine (MPG, 100mg/kg i.p.), a free radical scavenger, fully prevented the impairment of vasomotor function in the middle cerebral artery on both sides after I/SR. Moreover, vasomotor functions were normal in the coronary, renal and pulmonary arteries after I/SR. In conclusion, focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion impaired vasoconstrictor responses in remote brain arteries of rats by a mechanism involving free radicals. The lack of similar effects in peripheral vessels indicates poor defence of brain arteries against remote injury caused by reactive oxygen species-dependent mechanisms.
