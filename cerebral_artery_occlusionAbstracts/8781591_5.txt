BACKGROUND: Induced hypertension is one of the few interventions available to reverse acute ischemic neurologic deficit. The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of hypertension during prolonged temporary focal ischemia. METHODS: Anesthetized rats underwent 2 hours of endovascular middle cerebral artery occlusion. Angiotensin was given to increase mean arterial blood pressure to 40%-60% above baseline during ischemia. Neurologic deficit and infarct size in hypertensive rats were assessed at 72 hours. RESULTS: Hypertensive rats had smaller infarcts than normotensive controls (mean, 12.40 +/- 3.71% versus 24.19 +/- 2.89; p < 0.05) without hemorrhage. Neuroscores were comparable. CONCLUSION: Hypertension safely reduces infarction after 2 hours of focal ischemia in rats.
