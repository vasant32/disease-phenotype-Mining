We investigated whether the difference in infarction volume after occlusion of a long proximal segment of the middle cerebral artery between Wistar and Fischer-344 rats, is caused by differences in collateral blood flow rate through leptomeningeal anastomoses. In view of the retrograde direction of collateral blood flow into the middle cerebral artery territory, we developed parasagittal laser-Doppler flowmetry. Using this method two laser-Doppler probes are placed on the cerebral cortex: probe 1 is placed near the anastomoses between the middle- and anterior cerebral artery, probe 2 is placed 2 mm further away from these anastomoses than probe 1. We found in both rat strains a comparable relation between the areas under the curve of the signal measured by both laser-Doppler probes for 2 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion. This relation is considered to be a measurement of the collateral blood flow rate into the middle cerebral artery territory through leptomeningeal anastomoses after middle cerebral artery occlusion. We conclude that collateral blood flow for the two strains were essentially similar for the initial 2 h after MCA occlusion. Although these collateral blood flows could have been different at a later time, it is unlikely that the interstrain difference in cerebral infarction volume between Wistar and Fischer-344 rats after proximal middle cerebral artery occlusion is caused by an apparent interstrain difference in the magnitude of collateral blood flow rate through leptomeningeal anastomoses. The parasagittal laser-Doppler flowmetry technique we developed for these experiments is currently successfully used in our laboratory to evaluate the efficacy of hemodynamically active pharmacotherapeutical agents in raising the collateral blood flow rate into the middle cerebral artery territory after middle cerebral artery occlusion.
