BACKGROUND: Aneurysms arising from lenticulostriate artery branches in moyamoya-type disease are challenging lesions to treat, due to their fragility and deep location. Surgery is difficult and endovascular options may be limited. METHODS: A 57-year-old woman presented with a right ganglionic parenchymal hemorrhage due to a ruptured lenticulostriate artery aneurysm associated with ipsilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion. The aneurysm and parent feeding artery were occluded using endovascular injection of N-butyl cyanoacrylate. RESULTS: The aneurysm was successfully obliterated and although some glue did enter the more distal middle cerebral artery, there was no change in the patient's neurologic status. CONCLUSIONS: In highly selected cases where lenticulostriate aneurysms cannot be directly accessed for surgery or endovascular coiling, obliteration with liquid acrylic glue may be considered as a therapeutic option.
