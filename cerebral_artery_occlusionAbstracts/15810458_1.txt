OBJECTIVE: To study the protective effect of ligusticum chuanxiong phthalides on cerebral ischemia in rats and its related mechanism of action. METHOD: Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model, thrombosis formation, platelet aggregation and hemorrheological parameters were measured to evaluate the protective effect of ligusticum chuanxiong phthalides. RESULT: Ligusticum chuanxiong phthalides could markedly decrease the infarct size and behavior deficits score, inhibit the thrombus formation and platelet aggregation, ameliorate hemorrheological parameters with a dose-dependent manner in rats. CONCLUSION: Ligusticum chuanxiong phthalides has protective effects on focal cerebral ischemia in rats, and its mechanism may be relevant to its inhibition of platelet-dependent thrombosis and amelioration of hemorrheological parameters.
