AIM: To explore the protective effect of propyl gallate against neuronal injury in the boundary zone of the infarction area in the rat cerebral ischemia-reperfusion model and its possible mechanism. METHODS: Transient focal ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rats was established by ligation of the left internal carotid artery for 2 h. Rats were treated by propyl gallate with different doses (23.5, 47 and 94 micromol x kg(-1)) for three days before operation. Coronal brain sections were collected after 1 , 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 h of reperfusion, neuronal injury in the boundary zone of the infarction area was evaluated by TUNEL and Nissl staining. The expression of activated Caspase-3, total SAPK/JNK, p38MAPK and their phosphorylation (Thr183/Tyr185, Thr180/Tyr182) was investigated by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting with corresponding antibodies. RESULTS: Although SAPK/JNK immunoreactivity did not increase at each time point in the boundary zone of the infarction area after reperfusion, p-SAPK/JNK immunoreactivity increased significantly at 1 h and then decreased gradually, and p38MAPK immunoreactivity was enhanced at each time point, peaked at 6 h. Expression of p-p38MAPK peaked at 6 h. Activated Caspase-3 immunoreactivity appeared at 6 h in the boundary zone of the infarction area and peaked at 12 h. TUNEL positive neurons were observed at 12 h and became more abundant at 24 h. The number of Nissl positive neurons decreased gradually and apoptosis ratio of neurons peaked at 24 h. Propyl gallate reduced the immunoreactivity of SAPK/JNK, p-SAPK/JNK, p38MAPK and p-p38MAPK markedly at 1 and 6 h. Propyl gallate with doses of 47 and 94 micromol x kg(-1) were more effective. CONCLUSION: Inhibition on the activation of SAPK/JNK and p38MAPK is the possible protective mechanism of propyl gallate against neuronal injury induced by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.
