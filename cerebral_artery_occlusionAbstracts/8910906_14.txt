The purpose of the present study was to examine and quantify the functional consequence of a focal cerebral ischaemic lesion in a primate species, the marmoset. Following craniotomy and retraction of the frontal and temporal lobes, the middle cerebral artery was permanently occluded by means of electrocoagulation. Three and eight weeks after surgery, various behavioural tests were used to give a quantifiable measure to the neurological deficits produced. These tests required the monkeys to reach into tubes for foodbits, retrieve rewards from the steps of two designs of 'staircases', respond to one of two simultaneously presented rewarded tubes, remove adhesive labels attached to their feet, and respond to sensory stimuli. Unilateral motor impairment of the contralateral forelimb and neglect of contralateral tactile stimuli were seen in all subjects, and spatial neglect was also present in some monkeys. Subsequent histological analysis revealed unilateral cortical damage in all subjects with varying amounts of injury to the caudate and the putamen in some animals. These results demonstrate the potential for the use of this species in future investigations to examine the effect of neuroprotective treatment on functional outcome after a focal ischaemic insult.
