A strong hyperperfusion was reported in transient ischemic tissue between 48 and 72 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Cerebral blood flow (CBF) estimated by continuous arterial spin labeling (CASL) with short delay after tagging was sensitive to cerebral blood volume (CBV) change. The delayed hyperperfusion may indicate a CBV increase after MCAO. For confirmation of the delayed hyperperfusion, we investigated a transit-time dependency in CASL at two days after MCAO. We also acquired CBF using the dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) at the same day. We have confirmed the CBF in transient ischemic tissue is quite higher (179.1+/-21.6 ml/100g/min) than normal tissue (121.0+/-6.9 ml/100g/min) with CASL using tagging delay of 0.4 sec. CBF estimated by DSC also show delayed hyperperfusion in transient ischemic tissue. These results confirm existence of physiological delayed hyperperfusion in transient ischemic area.
