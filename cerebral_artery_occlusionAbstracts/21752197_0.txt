  Recent investigations have postulated a link between oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dysfunction in cerebral ischaemic/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Diabetes is common amongst elderly patients with stroke and has been postulated to aggravate brain I/R damage by triggering oxidative as well as ER stress. We investigated whether treatment with edaravone (1-10 mg/kg), a potent free radical scavenger protects against cerebral I/R injury in rats associated with comorbid type 2 diabetes. Diabetic rats exposed to 2-hr middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and 22 hr of reperfusion significantly had increased infarct, oedema volume and functional neurological deficits as compared to sham-operated rats. Also, the massive DNA fragmentation accompanied by significant increase in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) positive cells was noticed in the ipsilateral penumbral brain region of diabetic I/R rats. The effects of I/R injury were associated with significant up-regulation of 78 kDa-glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein or growth arrest DNA damage-inducible gene 153 (CHOP/GADD153) and activation of caspase-12, markers of ER stress/apoptosis. Treatment with edaravone (3 and 10 mg/kg) significantly diminished the cerebral infarct, oedema volume and improved functional recovery of neurological deficits. In addition, edaravone treatment ameliorated the DNA fragmentation concomitantly with a significant decrease in induction of GRP78, CHOP/GADD153 immunoreactivity/expression and activation of caspase-12 in the ischaemic brain hemispheres. Overall, the present data indicate that edaravone offers good neuroprotection against diabetic stroke by interrupting the ER stress-mediated apoptotic pathways involving CHOP/GADD153 and caspase-12.
