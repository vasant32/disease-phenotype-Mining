Oxygen free radicals and nitric oxide (NO.) have been proposed to be involved in acute CNS injury produced by cerebral ischemia; however, controversy remains regarding how they cause injury. Because superoxide generation is triggered during reperfusion, the cytotoxic oxidant peroxynitrite could be formed, but it is not known if this occurs. Dot blot and immunohistochemistry studies were performed on the magnitude and time course of tyrosine nitration and inducible NO synthase (NOS2) in the postischemic rat pup brain. Neonatal ischemia was induced by permanent left middle cerebral artery occlusion in association with 1-h occlusion of the left common carotid artery in 7-day-old Wistar pups. Nitrotyrosine (NT) immunoreactivity was evident in the blood vessels close to the cortical infarct at 48-72 h of recovery, and T lymphocytes were involved with this production. NOS2 immunoreactivity was seen in neutrophils in the same vessels and in the parenchyma at 72 h of recirculation. Whereas NT staining decreased with time, NOS2-positive neutrophils could be still detected in arachnoid vessels at 14 days of recirculation. We conclude that perivascular reactions mediated by peroxynitrite are important in the cascade of events that lead to brain oxidative stress in neonatal ischemia. Moreover, NO-related species may serve as a signaling function instead of directly mediating toxicity.
