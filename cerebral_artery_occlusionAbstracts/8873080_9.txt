The aim of this study was to determine whether neurotrophin-4/5 (NT-4/5) treatment alters infarction volume following permanent focal cerebral ischemia in the rat. Permanent focal cerebral ischemia was produced in adult male rats by intraluminal occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery. NT-4/5 was administered intraventricularly one day before and immediately following occlusion. Rats were sacrificed at 1, 4 and 7 days after occlusion. NT-4/5 treatment reduced infarction volume by 34% when compared to control rats 1 day after occlusion. Infarction volume was unaltered by treatment 4 to 7 days after occlusion. Middle cerebral artery occlusion led to a significant reduction in levels of mRNAs coding for catalytic and truncated TrkB receptors. This expression was unaffected by NT-4/5 treatment.
