Cerebral ischemia induces sensorimotor and cognitive dysfunctions in rodents; however, little is known about the changes in the spatio-temporal organization of locomotor activity after ischemia. In this study, we continuously assessed the spatio-temporal properties of locomotor activity in an enclosure (40 cm x 40 cm x 65 cm, arbitrarily divided into 16 zones) with feeding and drinking supplies, and observed the spatio-temporal changes in mice with focal cerebral ischemia. Locomotor tracks were recorded from 3rd to 24th h (total 22 h) after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) or sham operation. The absolute and relative distance traveled or time spent in different regions was analyzed. We found that there was no significant difference in total traveled distances over 22 h between the two groups. Control mice moved and stayed primarily in feeding and drinking zones, frequently in peripheral but rarely in central zones. However, ischemic mice lost such a property, almost evenly moved and stayed in 16 zones. Mice in both groups were more active (traveled more distances) shortly after they entered the enclosure, while ischemic mice returned to stable levels slower. The traveled distance had a remarkable circadian variation with more locomotion in the night in control mice, but not in ischemic mice. Most of the spatial parameters (ratios) of locomotor activity were closely correlated with the ischemic infarction, neuron densities (in cortex, hippocampal CA1 region and striatum), and typical behavioral assessments (neurological scores and inclined board test). Thus, these findings indicate that focal cerebral ischemia does not alter the amount of locomotor activity in mice, but impairs the spatio-temporal properties-prolonging the initial hyperactivity and losing regionally special distribution of the activity.
