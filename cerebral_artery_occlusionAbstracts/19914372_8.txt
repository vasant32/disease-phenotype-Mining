The immune response to stroke is comprised of inflammatory and regulatory processes. One cell type involved in both innate and adaptive immunity is the dendritic cell (DC). A DC population residing in the healthy brain (bDC) was identified using a transgenic mouse expressing enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) under the promoter for the DC marker, CD11c (CD11c/EYFP Tg). To determine if bDC are involved in the immune response to cerebral ischemia, transient (40 min) middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by 6, 24, or 72 h reperfusion was conducted in CD11c/EYFP Tg mice. Our results demonstrated that DC accumulated in the ischemic hemisphere at 24 h post-MCAO-reperfusion, particularly in the border region of the infarct where T lymphocytes accrued. To distinguish resident bDC from the infiltrating peripheral DC, radiation chimeras [1. wild type (WT) hosts restored with CD11c/EYFP Tg bone marrow (BM) or 2. CD11c/EYFP Tg hosts restored with WT BM] were generated and examined by immunocytochemistry. These data confirmed that DC populating the core of the infarct at 72 h were of peripheral origin, whereas those in the border region were comprised primarily of resident bDC. The brain resident (CD45 intermediate) cells of CD11c/EYFP Tg mice were analyzed by flow cytometry. Compared to microglia, bDC displayed increased major histocompatibility class II (MHC II) and co-stimulatory molecules following MCAO-reperfusion. High levels of MHC II and the co-stimulatory molecule CD80 on bDC at 72 h corresponded to peak lymphocyte infiltration, and suggested a functional interaction between these two immune cell populations.
