2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) is commonly applied in rodents and cats as a marker of infarcted tissue as early as 20 min after the onset of focal ischaemia. At this stage it is suggested that it reflects hypoperfusion rather than failure of respiratory chain. Immersion of brain slices in TTC solution is preferable in comparison to perfusion with TTC in order to ensure, that enough TTC enters the post-occlusion tissue. We compared immersion technique versus perfusion technique 6 h after permanent occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery in 18 baboons. In addition, we assessed the function of the respiratory chain enzymes of stained and unstained tissue in three baboons. The immersion technique revealed an absence of TTC staining limited to subcortical structures in two animals. In seven experiments TTC indicated involvement of almost the entire MCA territory. The extent of the ischaemic lesion indicated by the perfusion technique was very similar. Tissue samples from the presumed infarcted areas revealed normal mitochondrial function. We conclude that perfusion and immersion technique do not cause significant different ischaemic delineation 6 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion. TTC staining appears to be a reliable method of evaluating volume of infarction in primates. Furthermore, absence of TTC staining 6 h after stroke onset is caused by energy or oxygen depletion rather than by mitochondrial injury.
