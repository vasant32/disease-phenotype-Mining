BACKGROUND: When compared with barbiturates, isoflurane may lack protective effects during focal cerebral ischemia. The reason for this difference is not clear. In this study, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), arterial and venous O2 saturation, and O2 extraction were compared in the ischemic cortex and in the nonischemic brain regions of rats anesthetized with isoflurane or pentobarbital using a microspectrophotometric technique that directly measures the O2 saturation of blood in the small arteries and veins. METHODS: Twenty-eight rats were anesthetized with 1.4% isoflurane or 50 mg/kg pentobarbital. One hour after a middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion, rCBF was measured in the ischemic cortex and in the nonischemic brain regions using 14C-iodoantipyrine in one-half of each group of animals. Regional arterial and venous O2 saturation were determined using microspectrophotometry in the other one-half of each group. RESULTS: The rCBF of the ischemic cortex (IC) and the non-ischemic contralateral cortex (CC) of the isoflurane group were significantly higher than those of the pentobarbital group. The venous O2 saturation was significantly less, and the O2 extraction was significantly higher, in the IC than in the nonischemic regions in both groups of animals (pentobarbital group, IC 10.5 +/- 1.1 ml O2.100 ml blood-1, CC 6.3 +/- 0.7; isoflurane group, IC 10.8 +/- 0.6, CC 5.9 +/- 0.2). There was no significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Because the rCBF was less and the O2 extraction was similar, O2 consumption in the focal ischemic area of the brain during pentobarbital anesthesia must have been less than that during isoflurane anesthesia.
