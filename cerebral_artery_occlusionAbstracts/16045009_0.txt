OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of sodiun aescinate on Bcl-2 and Caspase-3 protein expression and neuronal apoptosis after focal cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury in rats. METHODS: One hundred male Wistar rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and reperfusion. The rats were divided randomly into 4 groups: sham-operated group and MCAO and reperfusion model groups which were randomly divided into control group, saline group, and sodium aescinate group. The immunohistochemistry staining and microscope image were used to observe the dynamic Bcl-2 and Caspase-3 protein expression in the ischemic penumbra after the reperfusion. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed for the detection of apoptosis. RESULTS: Bcl-2 protein expression in the sodium aescinate group was significantly higher than that of the saline group and control group (P < 0.05). While Caspase-3 protein expression in the sodium aescinate group was then compared with those of the saline group and control group, and showed the difference was significant (P < 0.05). Compared with the saline group and control group, the number of apoptotic cells in the sodium aescinate group was significantly reduced (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Sodium aescinate increases Bcl-2 protein expression and decreases Caspase-3 protein expression,through which it can protect the ischemia brain on reperfusion injury.
