 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of terahydroxy stilbene glucoside (TSG) on neurological deficits, the expressions of nerve growth factor (NGF) and growth associated protein43 (GAP43) in rats after Cerebral Ischemia-reperfusion. METHODS: 96 Sprague-Dawley male rats were divided into four groups (n = 24): control group, ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) model group, low dose TSG (60 mg/kg) group and high dose TSG (120 mg/kg) group. After 6 days' administration of TSG or natural saline (model group), reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was established by intraluminal suture technique. Rats in control group were operated while middle cerebral artery were not blocked. At 6, 24, 48 h and 7 d after reperfusion, behavior test was used to evaluate the neurological deficiency of each group. The expressions of NGF and GAP-43 in the cortex were measured by immunohistochemical method. RESULTS: Compared with model group, both dose of TSG could decrease the grade of the rat neurological defects except at 6 h of ter reperfusion and increase the protein expressions of NGF and GAP-43 after reperfusion. CONCLUSION: TSG can improve the neurological function through increasing the expressions of NGF and GAP-43 of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion rats.
