Flavonoids have been intensively studied on their pharmacological activities such as anti-cancer, anti-oxidant and anti-inflammation. However, little is known about their neuroprotective effects. Recent studies suggest that inflammation mediated by microglia may play a role in neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory effect of various flavonoid compounds by using BV-2, a murine microglia cell line. Of the compounds that were evaluated, apigenin inhibited the production of nitric oxide and prostaglandin E(2) by suppressing the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 protein, respectively. Moreover, apigenin suppressed p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation without affecting the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Apigenin was also found to protect neuronal cells from injury in middle cerebral artery occlusion.
