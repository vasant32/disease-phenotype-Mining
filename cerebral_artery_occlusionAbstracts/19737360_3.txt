There are few studies that denote whether bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) and bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (MNC) show the same therapeutic effects, when directly transplanted into the infarct brain. This study therefore aimed to compare their biological properties and behaviors in the infarct brain. Mouse BMSC were harvested and cultured. Mouse MNC were obtained through centrifugation techniques. Their cell markers were analyzed with FACS analysis. The MNC (10(6) cells; n = 10) or BMSC (2 x 10(5) cells; n = 10) were stereotactically transplanted into the ipsilateral striatum of the mice subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion at 7 days after the insult. Their survival, migration, and differentiation in the infarct brain were precisely analyzed using immunohistochemistry 4 weeks after transplantation. The MNC were positive for CD34, CD45, CD90, but were negative for Sca-1. The BMSC were positive for CD90 and Sca-1. The transplanted BMSC, but not MNC, extensively migrated into the peri-infarct area. Approximately 20% of the transplanted BMSC expressed a neuronal marker, NeuN in the infarct brain, although only 1.4% of the transplanted MNC expressed NeuN. These findings strongly suggest that there are large, biological differences between MNC and BMSC as cell sources of regenerative medicine for ischemic stroke.
