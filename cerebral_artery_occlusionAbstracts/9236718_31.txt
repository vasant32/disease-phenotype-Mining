Glial inclusions containing the microtubule-associated protein tau are present in a variety of chronic neurodegenerative conditions. We now report a rapid and time-dependent increase of tau immunoreactivity within oligodendrocytes after focal cerebral ischemia in the rat. The number of tau positive oligodendrocytes in the ipsilateral subcortical white matter increased six- to eightfold by 40 minutes after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Tau was detected using antibodies that label both the N- and C-terminal of the protein, suggesting accumulation of full-length protein within these cells. Pretreatment with the spin trap agent alpha-phenyl-tert-butyl-nitrone (PBN)(100mg/kg) reduced the number of tau-positive oligodendrocytes by 55% in the subcortical white matter of the ischemic hemisphere compared with untreated animals at 40 minutes after MCAO. In contrast, pretreatment with glutamate receptor antagonists MK-801 (0.5 mg/kg) or 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulpfamoyl-benzo(f)quinoxaline (NBQX) (2 x 30 mg/kg), failed to reduce the number of tau-positive oligodendrocytes after 40 minutes of ischemia. The results indicate that oligodendrocytes respond rapidly to an ischemic challenge and that free radical-mediated mechanisms are involved in the cascade leading to increased tau immunoreactivity.
