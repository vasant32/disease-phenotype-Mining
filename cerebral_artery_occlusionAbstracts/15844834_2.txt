BNG-1, a novel mixture of traditional Chinese medicines with a long history in the treatment of stroke, exhibited acute neuroprotection effect on rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Anti-ischemic effects were seen in both animals receiving BNG-1 before the ischemic insult as well as in animals receiving the drug formulation after surgical occlusion of the artery. Anti-thrombic activity was seen in vitro to inhibit arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation and in vivo to prolong bleeding time in mice. BNG-1 was also found to inhibit several phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoforms with potency order of the following rank: PDE 1 > PDE 3 > PDE 6 > PDE 2 > PDE 4 > PDE 5. Other pre-clinical results and emerging clinical data coupled with the present findings suggest that BNG-1 may be a safe and effective therapy for both the prevention and treatment of cerebral stroke. Moreover, the fundamental cellular mechanism underlying its therapeutic effects may result from phosphodiesterase inhibition.
