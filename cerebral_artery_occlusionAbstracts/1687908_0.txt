The effects of verticillatine (Ver), hexamethonium (Hex) and nimodipine (Nim) on mean arterial pressure (MAP), cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebrovascular resistance (CVR) were determined in pentobarbital anesthetized animals using the method of electromagnetic flow meter in dogs and hydrogen clearance in cats. Ver or Nim iv induced significant reduction of MAP and CVR. CBF was increased in dogs and unaltered in cats. The Hex treated dogs and cats exhibited a fall of MAP and CBF with enhancement of CVR. In cats after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was reduced from 190 +/- 70 to 90 +/- 20 ml.kg-1.min-1. Ver and Nim iv caused similar changes of MAP and CVR to those before MCAO. The results suggest that Ver and Nim may have vasodilation effect and improve the cerebral circulation. Thus, they would be beneficial to patients suffering from hypertension.
