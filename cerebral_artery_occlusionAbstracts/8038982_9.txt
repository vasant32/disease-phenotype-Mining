As propofol has been reported to have effects similar to those of thiopentone on cerebral blood flow, intracranial pressure and cerebral metabolic rate, we postulated that it might also have a protective effect on focal cerebral ischemia. This experiment was designed to test whether or not propofol can alter infarct volume resulting from permanent focal cerebral ischemia in rats. Forty-five rats were randomly assigned to three groups, all of which received xylaxine (5 mg kg-1 im) and ketamine (100 mg kg-1 ip) anesthesia. Rectal temperatures were controlled at 36-37 degrees C. A right temporal craniotomy was performed and the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was ligated with a 10-O suture. Both common carotid arteries (CCAs) were then occluded for 60 minutes using aneurysm clips. In Group 1 rats (n = 15), normal saline (1 ml kg-1 i.v.) was given right after MCA and CCAs ligation. In Group 2 rats (N = 15), propofol (10 mg kg-1 i.v. bolus) was given right after MCA and CCAs ligation. In Group 3 rats (n = 15), continuous intravenous infusion of propofol (16 mg kg-1 hr-1) was given for four hours following MCA and CCAs ligation, during which time mean arterial pressure was maintained approximately 90 mmHg. Twenty-four hours after ischemia, the brains were removed, frozen, sectioned and stained with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride. The cross-sectional area of infarction on each brain slice was measured using computer imaging analysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
