 OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to explore the protective effects of CG on rat cerebral injury after focal cerebral I /R. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to right middle cerebral artery occlusion for 60 minutes followed by reperfusion for 60 minutes or 24 hours. CG (0.4 or 0.8 g/kg) was administrated 90 minutes before ischemia. Brian edema was evaluated by Evan's blue dye extravasations and brain water content, leukocyte adhesion, and albumin leakage were determined with an upright fluorescence microscope, and neuron damage was assessed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling, and immunohistochemistry of caspase-3, p53, p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis. RESULTS: Focal cerebral I/R elicited a prominent brain edema, an increase in leukocyte adhesion, and albumin leakage, as well as neuron damage. All the insults after focal cerebral I/R were significantly attenuated by pretreatment with CG. CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment with CG significantly reduced focal cerebral I/R-induced brain edema, cerebral microcirculatory disturbance, and neuron damage, suggesting the potential of CG as a prophylactic strategy for patients in danger of stroke.
