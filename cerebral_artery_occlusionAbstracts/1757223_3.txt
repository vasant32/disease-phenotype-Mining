Endothelin-1 and its receptors are widely distributed in the brain of rodents and humans. In view of its potent and long-lasting vasoconstrictor activity, a role of endothelin-1 has been proposed in brain ischemia. In the present paper, the local injection of endothelin-1 was utilized to induce ischemia in rat striatum. An evaluation of the rostrocaudal extension of the lesion is reported. By using intracerebral microdialysis, a marked increase of lactate and dopamine, but not glutamate, was observed in this region upon endothelin-1 administration. Moreover, preliminary data reported show a protective effect of ganglioside treatment on endothelin-1 lesion of rat striatum. The characteristics of the present model of brain ischemia are discussed in comparison with well characterized models, such as the Pulsinelli's four vessel occlusion and the middle cerebral artery occlusion.
