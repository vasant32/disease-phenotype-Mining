 OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of 3'-methoxy puerarin on cerebral ischemic glutamic acid, aspartic acid, taurine and gamma-aminobutyric acid inhibitory of rats and investigate the protective mechanisms of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. METHOD: Using middle cerebral artery occlusion rat model, to collect extracellular fluid in rat striatal amino acid neurotransmitters by brain microdialysis and HPLC techniques with fluorescence detection before and after 3'-methoxy puerarin treatment four kinds of amino acids changes. RESULT: 3'-methoxy puerarin reduced concentrations of excitatory amino acid (EAA) Asp and Glu, while Tau and GABA inhibitory amino acids were significantly reduced. CONCLUSION: 3'-methoxy puerarin reduce ischemia-induced brain EAA toxicity against EAA neurotoxicity, regulate the brain neurotransmitter amino acid content, improve the excitatory and inhibitory amino acid balance is one of the mechanisms that to improve and protect the important acute cerebral infarction in rat brain nuclei.
