 PURPOSE: To test the hypotheses that (i) the regional heterogeneity of brain sodium concentration ([Na(+)](br)) provides a parameter for ischemic progression not available from apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) data, and (ii) [Na(+)](br) increases more in ischemic cortex than in the caudate putamen (CP) with its lesser collateral circulation after middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat. MATERIALS AND METHODS: (23)Na twisted projection MRI was performed at 3 Tesla. [Na(+)](br) was independently determined by flame photometry. The ischemic core was localized by ADC, by microtubule-associated protein-2 immunohistochemistry, and by changes in surface reflectivity. RESULTS: Within the ischemic core, the ADC ratio relative to the contralateral tissue was homogeneous (0.63 +/- 0.07), whereas the rate of [Na(+)](br) increase (slope) was heterogeneous (P < 0.005): 22 +/- 4%/h in the sites of maximum slope versus 14 +/- 1%/h elsewhere (here 100% is [Na(+)](br) in the contralateral brain). Maximum slopes in the cortex were higher than in CP (P < 0.05). In the ischemic regions, there was no slope/ADC correlation between animals and within the same brain (P > 0.1). Maximum slope was located at the periphery of ischemic core in 8/10 animals. CONCLUSION: Unlike ADC, (23)Na MRI detected within-core ischemic lesion heterogeneity.
