Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) by endovascular suture has gained increasing acceptance because it is relatively non-invasive and allows reperfusion. However, its application in rats has resulted in inconsistent infarction volumes which involve only the subcortex or subcortex plus some cortex. In order to eliminate this drawback, we applied the intraluminal suture occlusion of MCA to gerbils that have an incomplete Circle of Willis. MCAO was induced by inserting an endovascular 5-0 nylon suture with a blunted tip into the Circle of Willis. Animals were divided into two groups: permanent MCAO for 24 h (n = 8) and transient MCAO for 3 h with 21 h reperfusion (n = 8). The corrected infarction volume in the permanent MCAO group was 232 +/- 37 mm3 whereas it was 230 +/- 45 mm3 in the transient MCAO group. All animals in both groups had infarction in both cortex and subcortex. Results of this study show that endovascular suture occlusion of MCA can be easily applied in gerbils to obtain consistent infarction. This would allow both transient and permanent focal ischemia to be tested in the same model of ischemia.
