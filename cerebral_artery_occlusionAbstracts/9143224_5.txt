The effects of SB 206284A, 1-[7-(4-benzyloxyphenoxy)heptyl] piperidine hydrochloride, have been investigated in vitro on calcium and sodium currents in rat-cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurones and potassium-mediated calcium influx in rat synaptosomes. Cardiovascular hemodynamic effects in both anesthetized and conscious rats, and neuroprotective activity in in vivo cerebral ischemia models were also investigated. In the rat DRG cells, SB 206284A caused almost complete block of the sustained inward Ca2+ current (IC50 = 2.4 microM), suggesting that the compound is an effective blocker of slowly inactivating, high-voltage calcium current. SB 206284A reduced locomotor hyperactivity in the gerbil bilateral carotid artery occlusion model without affecting ischemia-induced damage in the hippocampal CA1 region. In the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion model, SB 206284A reduced lesion volume in the posterior forebrain, and in the rat photochemical cortical lesion model, lesion volume was reduced even when treatment was delayed until 4 hours after occlusion. At neuroprotective doses, SB 206284A had no cardiovascular effects. These findings show that SB 206284A is a novel calcium channel antagonist that shows neuroprotective properties.
