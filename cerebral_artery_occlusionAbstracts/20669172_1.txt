Intravenous administration of iron oxide nanoparticles after experimental stroke has been shown to produce focal signal intensity changes in the ischemic boundary on MRI images. These changes have been attributed to the influx of iron-laden blood-borne macrophages, although it has been suggested that this effect might not always be completely specific to inflammatory cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate this phenomenon in a subacute time frame that is more relevant to the peripheral inflammatory response. Imaging experiments (T(2) -, T(2)*- and T(1) -weighted sequences) were acquired in Wistar rats 6 days after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Animals were intravenously infused with different doses of ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) nanoparticles (300, 600 or 1000 µmol Fe/kg), or saline and gadolinium, and imaged again 24 h later. Tissue was immediately processed for immunohistochemistry with the macrophage marker ED-1, in combination with Prussian blue for iron. Ischemic tissue exhibited a large increase in T(2) values, and overall contrast enhancement was apparent in the brain and surrounding muscle. In contrast with previous reports, there were no regions of focal signal intensity changes in the ischemic territory in any of the images, although a region of interest analysis revealed a trend towards iron accumulation in the ischemic hemisphere, particularly in the cortex of T(2)* images. However, histological examination revealed that, despite extensive ED-1-positive macrophage accumulation in the entire ischemic territory, none of these cells were Prussian blue positive, except in the meninges of one animal that received a high dose of USPIO nanoparticles. These results imply that the observed trend is a result of the presence of contrast agent in the blood, or meninges, and not iron-containing inflammatory cells.
