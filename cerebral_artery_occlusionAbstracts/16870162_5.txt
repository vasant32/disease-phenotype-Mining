Previous studies have demonstrated that polydatin, a crystal component extracted from the root stem of the perennial herbage Polygonum Cuspidatum Sieb.et Zucc, exerts a neuroprotective effect on cerebral injury induced by ischemia/reperfusion. To investigate the possible mechanism of this action, we determined the effects of polydatin on the expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) after ischemia-induced cerebral injury. Rats were treated with polydatin (i.v.) immediately after the operation of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 1 h. It was found that polydatin improved neurological deficits and reduced the volume of brain infarction. In addition, polydatin decreased the levels of CAMs relative to the control (MCAO alone); these included intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), E-selectin, L-selectin and Integrins. These results suggest that polydatin exerts protective effects likely via inhibition of the expression of various CAMs; polydatin may be a potential agent for treatment of brain injury associated with stroke.
