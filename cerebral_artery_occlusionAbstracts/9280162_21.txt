Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) was applied topically on the brain surface of reperfused rat brain after 90 min of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. In contrast to the cases treated with vehicle, a formation of brain edema was greatly reduced at 2 days by the treatment with GDNF. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin in situ nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was also markedly reduced in the cases with GDNF treatment both at 1 and 2 days of reperfusion. However, amelioration of the induction of immunoreactive 70 kDa heat shock protein was only a minimum by the GDNF treatment. The present results suggest that the treatment with GDNF has a significant effect on ameliorating brain edema formation after transient focal brain ischemia, and the effect is greatly associated with the reduction of TUNEL staining, but minimally with that of stress response of cells.
