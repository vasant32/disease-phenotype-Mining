BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We examined the efficacy of the antioxidant LY231617 administered five hours following middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in rats. METHODS: The treatment was contrived for a two hour interval. Group A (n = 16) was left untreated. Group B (n = 16) received an intravenous infusion of LY231617. Group C (n = 16) received saline (86 microliters/min) by retrograde infusion of the cerebral vein (RICV). Group D (n = 22) was administered LY231617 (10mg/kg/2 hr) in saline (86 microliters/min) by RICV. Local cerebral blood flow with [14C]-iodoantipyrine and blood-brain transfer constant with 14C-alpha-amino-isobutyric acid were examined. Early ischemic damage was histologically examined with cresyl violet and Luxol fast blue and with triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride. RESULTS: The results revealed a marked increase in local cerebral blood flow (over 600%, p < 0.01) after RICV with LY231617, with a significant improvement of BBB permeability in rats from group D. Ischemic brain damage measured with Luxol fast blue and triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride methods showed a significant improvement (50-91%) of ischemic damage in group D, as compared to groups B and C. CONCLUSION: Retrograde infusion of the cerebral vein with LY231617 resulted in a significant amelioration at seven hours post MCA occlusion.
