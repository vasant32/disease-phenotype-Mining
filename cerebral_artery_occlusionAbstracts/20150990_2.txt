Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a proinflammatory cytokine of the interleukin-1 family which is upregulated after cerebral ischemia. The functional role of IL-18 in cerebral ischemia is unknown. In the present study, we compared infarct size in IL-18 knock-out and wild-type mice 24 hours and 48 hours after 1-hour transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Moreover, the functional outcome was evaluated in a modified Bederson score, foot fault test and grip test. There were no significant differences in infarct size or functional outcome tests between wild-type and IL-18 knock-out mice. These data indicate that the early inflammatory response to cerebral ischemia does not involve IL-18, in contrast to other interleukin-1 family members such as interleukin-1.
