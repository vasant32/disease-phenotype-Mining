We report a successful emergency embolectomy in a patient presenting a left middle cerebral artery occlusion by an embolizing microcoil that was being used to thrombose an aneurysm of the ophthalmic artery. In selected cases, emergency embolectomy can be considered as the treatment of distal embolization by the materials used in neuroendovascular procedures.
