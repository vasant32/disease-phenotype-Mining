Oxidative stress may be regarded as an imbalance between free radical production and opposing antioxidant defenses. Free radical oxidative stress is implicated in rat cerebral ischemia and naturaceutical antioxidants are dietary supplements that have been reported to have neuroprotective activity. Many studies have reported dietary sesame oil (SO) as an effective antioxidant. In the present study the neuroprotective effect of dietary SO was evaluated against middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced cerebral ischemia injury in rats. Rats were fed on diet (20% SO) for 15 days. The middle cerebral artery of adult male Wistar rat was occluded for 2 h and reperfused for 22 h. The antioxidant properties of brain were measured as levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxide (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS). A decrease in the activity of all the enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants was observed along with an increase in lipid peroxidation (LPO) in MCAO group. The neurobehavioral activity of rats was also observed by using videopath analyzer. Dietary SO improved the antioxidant status in MCAO+SO group when compared with MCAO group. The results of neurobehavioral activity also support our biochemical data. The results obtained suggest protective effect of SO against cerebral ischemia in rat brain through their antioxidant properties.
