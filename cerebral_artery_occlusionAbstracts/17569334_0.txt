OBJECTIVE: To observe the protective effect of Kang Naoxueshuan Tablet (KNT) on ischemic brain injury in rats, and explore its possible mechanism. METHODS: Rats were administrated with KNT twice per day for successive 14 days. Rat model of acute focal cerebral ischemia was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with a nylon suture inserted through the right internal carotid artery to occlude the beginning of middle cerebral artery. After 24 hrs MCAO, the neurological deficit and the volume of cerebral infarct were observed, and the effect of KNT on the thrombosis of rats in vitro, platelet aggregation and blood viscosity were also determined. RESULTS: KNT could alleviate volume of cerebral infarct caused by focal cerebral ischemia in a dose-dependent manner and improve neurological symptoms. The volume of cerebral infarct was 11. 18 +/- 3. 35% , 14. 60 +/- 7.00% and 15. 37 +/- 7. 21% in the high, middle and low-dose groups, respectively, and they were decreased 59. 36% , 46. 93% and 44. 13% than that in the model group 27. 51 +/- 4. 71% (P <0. 01 ). The wet and dry weigh of thrombosis in vitro of the three different dose groups were significantly decreased, and they were significantly different than that of the model group (P <0. 05, P <0. 01). KNT could significantly inhibit platelet aggregation induced by ADP and decrease blood viscosity, but it had no effect on plasma viscosity and hematocrit. CONCLUSION: KNT has significant protective effect on ischemia, the mechanism is relateed to the improvement of blood viscosity and inhibiti on of platelet aggregation. But the exact mechanisms need to be probed into deeply.
