Cats were treated using a blinded protocol with either the dextrorotary or levorotary form of WIN 44,441-3 injected subcutaneously six hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion, followed by continuous subcutaneous infusion. The levorotary form acutely improved neurologic function in 90% of animals, whereas the dextrorotary form had no effect. Survival rate and infarct size were the same in both groups. These results further implicate the kappa receptor in the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia.
