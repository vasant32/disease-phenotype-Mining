 BACKGROUND: The involvement of the complement system in brain injury has been scarcely investigated. Here, we document the pivotal role of mannose-binding lectin (MBL), one of the recognition molecules of the lectin complement pathway, in brain ischemic injury. METHODS AND RESULTS: Focal cerebral ischemia was induced in mice (by permanent or transient middle cerebral artery occlusion) and rats (by 3-vessel occlusion). We first observed that MBL is deposited on ischemic vessels up to 48 hours after injury and that functional MBL/MBL-associated serine protease 2 complexes are increased. Next, we demonstrated that (1) MBL(-/-) mice are protected from both transient and permanent ischemic injury; (2) Polyman2, the newly synthesized mannosylated molecule selected for its binding to MBL, improves neurological deficits and infarct volume when given up to 24 hours after ischemia in mice; (3) anti-MBL-A antibody improves neurological deficits and infarct volume when given up to 18 hours after ischemia, as assessed after 28 days in rats. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show an important role for MBL in the pathogenesis of brain ischemic injury and provide a strong support to the concept that MBL inhibition may be a relevant therapeutic target in humans, one with a wide therapeutic window of application.
