The neuroprotective potential of ethanol:water (1:1) extract of rhizomes of Acorus calamus (AC-002) has been investigated in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced ischaemia in rats. A significant behavioural impairment in Rota-Rod performance and grid walking was observed in rats, 72 hours after MCAO as compared to sham-operated animals. These rats also exhibited an increase in lipid peroxidation (cortex -157%, corpus striatum - 58%) and a decrease in glutathione levels (cortex - 59%, corpus striatum - 34%) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity (cortex - 64%, corpus striatum - 32%) as compared to sham-operated animals. Ischaemic rats treated with AC-002 (25 mg/kg, p.o.) exhibited a significant improvement in neurobehavioural performance viz. Rota-Rod performance and grid walking as compared to the MCAO group. Interestingly, treatment with AC-002 in MCAO rats significantly decreased malonaldialdehyde levels in cortex as compared to ischaemic rats. A significant increase in reduced glutathione levels and SOD activity was also observed both in cortex and corpus striatum in MCAO rats treated with AC-002 in comparison to MCAO rats. Treatment with AC-002 in MCAO rats also reduced the contralateral cortical infarct area (19%) as compared to MCAO rats (33%). Neurological function score was improved in the AC-002-treated rats as compared to the MCAO group. The results of the present study indicate the neuroprotective efficacy of A. calamus in the rat model of ischaemia.
