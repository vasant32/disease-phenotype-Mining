The ability of dynamic, contrast-enhanced, magnetic susceptibility-weighted scanning to delineate early experimental acute cerebral infarction was compared with that of heavily T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted spin echo scanning. Spontaneously hypertensive rats, which had undergone right middle cerebral artery occlusion, were studied from 15 min to 3 h post ligation on a 1.5-T clinical whole-body imager. In contrast to the diffusion- and T2-weighted spin echo scans, the dynamic, contrast-enhanced technique clearly and consistently delineated the nonperfused regions as early as 15 min post ligation.
