Flavonoids are an important group of recognized antioxidants ubiquitous in fruits, vegetables and herbs. There are epidemiological evidences for the stroke-protecting capacity of flavonoids and while the neuroprotective power of complex extracts rich in flavonoids like those of Ginkgo biloba, green tea or lyophilized red wine have been demonstrated in several studies, neuroprotection by individual flavonoids has been poorly studied in vivo. The neuroprotective capacity of individual flavonoids was studied in PC12 cells in culture and in a model of permanent focal ischemia (permanent Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion - pMCAO). In the in vivo experiments, flavonoids were administered in lecithin preparations to facilitate the crossing of the blood brain barrier. The simultaneous incubation of PC12 cells with 200 micro M hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and different flavonoids for 30 min resulted in a conspicuous profile: quercetin, fisetin, luteolin and myricetin significantly increased cell survival while catechin, kaempherol and taxifolin did not. Quercetin was detected in brain tissue 30 min and 1 h after intraperitoneal administration. When one of the protective flavonoids (quercetin) and one of those that failed to increase PC12 cell survival (catechin) were assessed for their protective capacity in the pMCAO model, administered i.p. 30 min after vessel occlusion, quercetin significantly decreased the brain ischemic lesion while catechin did not. It is concluded that when administered in liposomal preparations, flavonoids structurally related to quercetin could become leads for the development of a new generation of molecules to be clinically effective in human brain ischemia.
