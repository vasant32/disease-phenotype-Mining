Nimodipine was administered by intravenous infusion to six male baboons before, during, and after 6 hours of middle cerebral artery occlusion. Intracranial pressure (ICP) and systemic blood pressure were monitored continuously. An epidural balloon was inflated at regular intervals at three levels of arterial CO2 tension (25, 35, and 50 mm Hg) before and after the administration of nimodipine, and volume-pressure curves were generated. In every case, curves generated after intravenous nimodipine infusion were lower and shifted more to the right than the same set of curves generated before nimodipine administration, regardless of the baseline ICP. The reduction in ICP following nimodipine infusion was not due to a reduction in mean arterial blood pressure and was statistically significant at all three levels of pCO2 (p less than 0.01). These results suggest that, in the presence of elevated ICP due to cerebral infarction, there is no increased risk of exacerbating intracranial hypertension with the addition of nimodipine.
