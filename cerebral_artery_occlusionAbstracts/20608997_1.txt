This study was conducted to demonstrate ultra-low-molecular-weight heparin's neuroprotective effects on ischemic injury both in vivo and in vitro studies. In vitro, the effect of ultra-low-molecular-weight heparin was tested in cultured PC12 cells exposed to Earle's solution containing sodium dithionite, to identify its neuroprotection to PC12 cells damaged by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). The cell injury was detected by the tetrazolium salt 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5 diphenyl-2H tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. In vivo, male Wistar rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion were evaluated for infarct volume followed by the treatment with ultra-low-molecular-weight heparin. The results in vitro showed that ultra-low-molecular-weight heparin significantly inhibited PC12 cells damage induced by OGD. Results in vivo showed that vein injection of Ultra-Low-molecular-weight heparin at doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg exerted significant neuroprotective effects on rats with focal cerebral ischemic injury by significantly reducing the infarct volume compared with the injury group. All the findings suggest that ultra-low-molecular-weight heparin might act as a neuroprotective agent useful in the treatment of cerebral ischemia.
