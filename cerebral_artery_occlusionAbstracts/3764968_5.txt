In order to determine the effect of lidocaine in focal cerebral ischemia, the left middle cerebral artery was transorbitally occluded in twenty cats. Eleven received lidocaine hydrochloride intravenously. The infusion was begun half an hour prior to clip occlusion and the rate was adjusted to maintain an isoelectric EEG. Nine cats served as controls, receiving an equivalent volume of 5% dextrose 0.2% saline. Thirteen animals (7 lidocaine-treated and 6 control) were sacrificed after six hours of left middle cerebral artery occlusion without reperfusion. In the remaining seven cats, the vessel was occluded for four hours prior to sacrifice. Ischemic neuronal alteration was assessed by both histochemical (2'3'5' triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium hydrochloride reaction) and histological examination. With both durations of ischemia, there was no significant difference in the extent and severity of neuronal alterations between the lidocaine-treated and control groups of animals.
