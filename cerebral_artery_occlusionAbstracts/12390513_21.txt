Human albumin therapy is highly neuroprotective in focal cerebral ischemia. Because albumin is the main carrier of free fatty acids (FFA) in plasma, we investigated the content and composition of plasma FFA in jugular vein (JV), femoral artery (FA) and femoral vein (FV) of rats given intravenous human albumin (1.25 g/kg) or saline vehicle (5 mL/kg) 1 h after a 2 h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) or sham surgery. Arachidonic acid was the only FFA significantly increased by MCAo in all plasma samples prior to albumin administration, remaining at the same level regardless of subsequent treatments. Albumin treatment induced in both MCAo- and sham-groups a 1.7-fold increase in total plasma FFA (mainly 16:0, 18:1, 18:2n-6) during 90-min reperfusion. MCAo selectively stimulated the albumin-mediated mobilization of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), with an early increase in 22:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 in the FA prior to detectable changes in the JV. In the MCAo-albumin group, the lower level of FFA in JV as compared with FA and FV suggests an albumin-mediated systemic mobilization and supply of FFA to the brain, which may favor the replenishment of PUFA lost from cellular membranes during ischemia and/or to serve as an alternative source of energy, thus contributing to albumin neuroprotection.
