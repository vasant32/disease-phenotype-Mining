Currently, the only Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment of acute stroke is recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, which must be administered within 6 hours after stroke onset. The pan-selective σ-receptor agonist N,N'-di-o-tolyl-guanidine (o-DTG) has been shown to reduce infarct volume in rats after middle cerebral artery occlusion, even when administered 24 hours after stroke. DTG derivatives were synthesized to develop novel compounds with greater potency than o-DTG. Fluorometric Ca(2+) imaging was used in cultured cortical neurons to screen compounds for their capacity to reduce ischemia- and acidosis-evoked cytosolic Ca(2+) overload, which has been linked to stroke-induced neurodegeneration. In both assays, migration of the methyl moiety produced no significant differences, but removal of the group increased potency of the compound for inhibiting acidosis-induced [Ca(2+)](i) elevations. Chloro and bromo substitution of the methyl moiety in the meta and para positions increased potency by ≤160%, but fluoro substitutions had no effect. The most potent DTG derivative tested was N,N'-di-p-bromo-phenyl-guanidine (p-BrDPhG), which had an IC(50) of 2.2 µM in the ischemia assay, compared with 74.7 μM for o-DTG. Microglial migration assays also showed that p-BrDPhG is more potent than o-DTG in this marker for microglial activation, which is also linked to neuronal injury after stroke. Radioligand binding studies showed that p-BrDPhG is a pan-selective σ ligand. Experiments using the σ-1 receptor-selective antagonist 1-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-4-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride (BD-1063) demonstrated that p-BrDPhG blocks Ca(2+) overload via σ-1 receptor activation. The study identified four compounds that may be more effective than o-DTG for the treatment of ischemic stroke at delayed time points.
