The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the neuroprotective effect of SM-20220 (N(aminoiminomethyl)-1-methyl-1H-indole-2-carboxamide methanesulfonate) and the timing of its administration in an experimental stroke model. Two hours of occlusion followed by 22 h of perfusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) was performed by inserting a nylon thread into the MCA to occlude it, and pulling the thread to initiate reperfusion. Intravenous infusion of SM-20220 for 1 h reduced the infarct volume at doses of 0.2-0.8 mg/kg in a dose-dependent manner without causing changes in the systemic arterial blood pressure or blood gases, when SM-20220 administration was started 1 h after the onset of occlusion. Administration of SM-20220 at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg also reduced the edema formation induced by ischemia. In contrast, SM-20220 failed to reduce the infarction, even at 1.6 mg/kg, when administration was started 2 h after the onset of occlusion. Thus, the therapeutic time window of SM-20220 for this transient MCA occlusion model is 1 h. Daily administration of SM-20220 (0.4 mg/kg) for the 7 d following 1.5 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion reduced the infarct volume with statistical significance (p<0.05), showing that SM-20220 did not merely delay but prevented ischemic damage.
