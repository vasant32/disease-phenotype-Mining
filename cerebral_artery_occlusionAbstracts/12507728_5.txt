In order to examine lipid metabolism in relation to neural process following brain ischemia, we investigated temporal and spatial changes of free cholesterol (FC) and neutral lipids (NLs) after 90 min of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Filipin and Nile Red stainings were performed to detect mainly FC and NLs, respectively. Double stainings for Nile Red plus ED1, MAP2, or GFAP were performed in order to identify cell type of positive stainings. Filipin stanining decreased during 1-7 day and lost at 21 day after transient MCAO in the ischemic core, but did not change in the penumbra. Nile Red positive droplets reached the maximum at 7 day after transient MCAO and gradually decreased in the core, while the peak time delayed in the penumbra. MAP2 immunoreactivity lost at 7 day in the core, and increased in the penumbra during 7-56 day. Most Nile Red positive droplets were double positive for ED1 in the core, and were localized within GFAP positive cells in the penumbra. These results suggest that changes of FC and NLs are different temporally and spatially between the core and penumbra in relation to degenerative and regenerative neural processes following brain ischemia.
