EGb 761 is a standardized extract of Ginkgo biloba that appears to have a neuroprotective effect against neurodegenerative diseases. Adult male rats were treated with EGb 761 (100 mg/kg) or vehicle prior to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and brains were collected 24 h after MCAO. Proteins that were differentially expressed after EGb 761 treatment during cerebral ischemia were detected using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Protein spots with more than a 2.5-fold change in intensity between vehicle- and EGb 761-treated groups were identified by mass spectrometry. The levels of peroxiredoxin-2 and protein phosphatase 2A subunit B were significantly decreased in the vehicle-treated group in comparison to the EGb 761-treated group. In contrast, levels of the collapsing response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) were significantly increased in vehicle-treated animals, while EGb 761 prevented the injury-induced increase of CRMP2. These results suggest that EGb 761 protects neuronal cells against ischemic brain injury through the specific up- and down-modulation of various proteins.
