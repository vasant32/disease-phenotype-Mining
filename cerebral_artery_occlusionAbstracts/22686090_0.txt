 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of injecting adenosine A1 receptor agonist (CCPA) into Baihui (GV20) on the cerebral cortex induced by the ischemia/reperfusion of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. METHODS: Twenty-four SD rats were randomly divided into four groups, i. e., the sham-operation group, the model group, the DMSO group, and the CCPA group. The MCAO model was established by thread embolism method. At the moment of ischemia/reperfusion, the rats in DMSO group and the CCPA group were injected with DMSO (20 microL) and CCPA (0.1 mmol) 20 microL into Baihui respectively. The rats' behavior, the histomorphology of ischemic penumbra in the cerebral cortex, the expressions of Bcl-2 protein, and the apoptosis rate of neurocytes were assessed. RESULTS: Compared with the model group and the DMSO group, the rats' behavior were markedly improved in the CCPA group (P<0.05). No obvious karyopyknosis and cytoplasm empty dye of neurons appeared. The Bcl-2 expressions in rats' cerebral cortex obviously increased (P<0.01). The apoptosis number of neurons obviously decreased (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Injecting CCPA into Bahui improved the rats' behavior and histomorphology in the ischemic penumbra, elevated the expressions of Bcl-2 protein, and reduced the neurons apoptosis rate in the ischemic penumbra. It alleviated the cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Therefore, it could be taken as a new treatment method.
