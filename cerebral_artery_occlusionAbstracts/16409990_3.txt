To gain greater insight on the molecular mechanisms that underlie ischemic stroke, we compared gene expression profiles in transient (tMCAO) and permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) stroke models using Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer (EASE) pathway analysis software. Many transcripts were induced in both stroke models, including genes associated with transcriptional pathways, cell death, stress responses and metabolism. However, EASE analysis of the regulated genes indicated molecular functions and biological processes unique to each model. Pathways associated with tMCAO included inflammation, apoptosis and cell cycle, while pMCAO was associated with the induction of genes encoding neurotransmitter receptors, ion channels, growth factors and signaling molecules. An intriguing finding was the involvement of tyrosine kinases and phosphatases following pMCAO. These results provide evidence that neuronal death following tMCAO and pMCAO involves distinct mechanisms. These findings may give new insight to the molecular mechanisms involved in stroke and may lead to novel neuroprotective strategies.
