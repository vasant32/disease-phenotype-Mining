Cerebral ischemia is associated with the induction of several heat shock proteins (HSPs), but the effects on HSP40 and GrpE are less clear. The present study investigated the induction of Hsp40 and GrpE mRNAs following 30 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat model. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization analyses showed significant induction of both mRNAs in the ischemic cortex. These results demonstrate the synergic induction of HSP70 molecular chaperone machinery in cerebral ischemia.
