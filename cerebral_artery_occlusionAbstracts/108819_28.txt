The relationship between increase in water content in ischemic brain and levels of regional blood flow has been studied in 11 primates. Flows were recorded using the method of hydrogen (2-minute) clearance, from a total of 128 electrodes in cortex and white matter, and a gradation of ischemia was produced by middle cerebral occlusion transorbitally. The flows were reduced in the area of densest ischemia from control levels of 12.0 +/- 12.0 ml/100g/min to 7.0 +/- 5.4 ml/100g/min, with lesser decreases over the remainder of the ischemic hemisphere. Water content was measured in cortex and white matter, in regions topographically related to those of flow measurements, by densitometric assessment using precalibrated kerosene/bromobenzine columns. The average water content of cortex in regions remote from ischemia was 797.4 +/- 5.8 mg/gm and in white matter 708.5 +/- 8.2 mg/gm. Significant increases in water content (comparing corresponding regions of the two hemispheres) of up to 11.4 +/- 7.5 mg/gm were demonstrated in the most ischemic cortical areas. A gradient of water increase was evident in the ischemic hemisphere, increases water content being greatest in the opercular zone and least in the parasagittal area. Significant differences in white matter water content between the 2 hemispheres were demonstrated only in the most densely ischemic areas in the current experiments where ischemia was limited to 93 +/- 20 mins in the 11 animals without reperfusion. The relationship between ischemic density and water content increase showed that significant increases in water content occurred in regions where terminal flows had been below 20 ml/100g/min, indicating that accumulation of water in ischemic brain begins at flow values comparable to those associated with the failure of synaptic transmission, higher than those associated with failure of the ionic pump of the cell. Possible pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed.
