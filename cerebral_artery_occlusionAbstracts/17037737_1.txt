OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of ligustrazine on cell proliferation in subventricular zone of lateral cerebral ventricle after middle cerebral artery occluded (MACO) in adult rat. METHODS: SD male rats were randomly divided into three group: sham operation group, ischemic model group and Ligustrazine group. The model of the middle cerebral artery occlusion was established by placement of an intraluminal filament at the origin of left MCA. Ligustrazine was administered intraperitoneally with a dose of 80 mg/kg daily starting at 2 hours after MCAO. BrdU (50 mg/kg) was injected once a day intraperitoneally starting at 4 hours after operation. Number of BrdU-positive cells and expression of doublecortin (DCX) in subventricular zone (SVZ) were measured by immunohistochemistry on day 7, 14, 24 after operation. RESULTS: Compared with sham operation group, BrdU-positive cells in ischemic model group increased on day 7, reached the peak on day 14, then decreased on day 21 after operation. On day 7 and 14, the numbers of BrdU-positive cells in Ligustrazine group were markedly augmented and significantly more than those in ischemic model group (P < 0.01), but decreased on day 21. The expressions of DCX in SVZ in ischemic model group were enhanced on day 7 with lasting into day 14, and reduced on day 21, but still higher than those in sham operation group on day 7, 14, and 21, respectively. The expressions of DCX in SVZ in Ligustrazine group increased gradually along with prolong of ischemia and kept the high level up to day 21 after operation, and were higher than those in ischemic model group on day 14 and 21. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that Ligustrazine may promote the cells of SVZ, which the adult rats suffer from the focal cerebral ischemia, to go into cell proliferation.
