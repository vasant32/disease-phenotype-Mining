The energy metabolism of the brain was measured in three types of ischemic models in the cat using phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The cerebral ischemia was produced as follows. In Group 1, two balloons were inflated in the left subclavian artery and the brachiocephalic trunk. In Group 2, the left middle cerebral artery was occluded through a transorbital approach. A combination of the two was employed in Group 3. Phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectra were obtained serially during 2 hours of ischemia. Immediately after occlusion, peaks of phosphocreatine and adenosine triphosphate decreased, whereas the peak of inorganic phosphate increased and split in two. Intracellular pH determined by chemical shift of the inorganic phosphate peak decreased. These changes were more pronounced in Group 3 when compared with the other groups. Histological study showed no infarction in Group 1 and infarcted areas in Groups 2 and 3. The size of the infarcted area in Group 3 was larger than that in Group 2. These results suggest that the model of middle cerebral artery occlusion potentiated with the occlusion of the brachiocephalic trunk and the left subclavian artery by balloon catheters is a reliable stroke model and that phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy is useful to understand the pathophysiological state of cerebral ischemia in vivo.
