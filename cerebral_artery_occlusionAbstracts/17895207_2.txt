Diffusion-weighted and perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI, PWI) are useful in detecting early cerebral ischemic lesions. Intra-arterial thrombolysis is an effective treatment for some patients with acute thromboembolic occlusion. We evaluated the efficacy of acute thrombolytic therapy by using DWI and PWI in 3 patients who presented with internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery occlusion. On the initial magnetic resonance imaging scans, the abnormal areas shown by PWI were bigger than those shown by DWI. All patients received thrombolytic therapy within 6 hours after stroke onset. In 1 patient, the hyperintensity area detected by initial DWI scanning diminished after thrombolysis. DWI and PWI may be useful to monitor the effectiveness of intra-arterial thrombolysis.
