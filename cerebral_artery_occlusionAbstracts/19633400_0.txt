The effect of hypoxia on glioma growth including pathological changes was investigated in an experimental model of brain ischemia in the rat C6 glioma model. C6 glioma cells were inoculated into the subcortex of adult Wistar rats. Focal cerebral ischemia near the implanted glioma area was induced by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (PMCAO). Ten days later, the rats were sacrificed to compare tumor volume of C6 glioma without PMCAO (control group) versus C6 glioma with PMCAO (hypoxia group). The histological features were also observed. The mean tumor volume in the hypoxia group was significantly larger than that in the control group. The most prominent histological finding in the hypoxia group was abundant formation of pseudopalisading around the necrotic areas. Immunohistological examinations showed intensive staining for vascular endothelial growth factor and hypoxia-inducible factor in these pseudopalisading cells. These findings suggest that cerebral ischemia positively modulates glioma mass growth by the formation of pseudopalisading necrosis, a characteristic histological finding of glioblastoma.
