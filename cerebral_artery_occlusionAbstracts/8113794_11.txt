Although considerable evidence supports a role for amino acids in transient global cerebral ischemia and permanent focal cerebral ischemia, effects of transient focal cerebral ischemia on the extracellular concentrations of amino acids have not been reported. Accordingly, our study was undertaken to examine the patterns of changes of extracellular glutamate, aspartate, GABA, taurine, glutamine, alanine, and phosphoethanolamine in the striatum of transient focal cerebral ischemia, as evidence to support their pathogenic roles. Focal ischemia was induced using the middle cerebral artery occlusion model, with no need for craniotomy. Microdialysis was used to sample the brain's extracellular space before, during, and after the ischemic period. One hour of middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by recirculation caused neuronal damage that was common in the frontoparietal cortex and the lateral segment of the caudate nucleus. During 1 h of ischemia, the largest increase occurred for GABA and moderate increases were observed for taurine, glutamate, and aspartate. Alanine, which is a nonneuroactive amino acid, increased little. After recirculation, the levels of glutamate and aspartate reverted to normal baseline values right after reperfusion. Despite these rapid normalizations, neuronal damage occurred. Therefore, uptake of excitatory amino acids can still be restored after 1 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion, and tissue damage occurs even though high extracellular levels of glutamate are not maintained.
