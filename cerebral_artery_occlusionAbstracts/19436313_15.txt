Males exhibit greater histologic and behavioral impairment after stroke than do age-matched females. However, the contribution of androgens to stroke outcome remains unclear. We compared outcomes from middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in castrated mice with those in testosterone- or dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-replaced castrated mice. Castrates treated with 1.5 mg testosterone or 0.5 mg DHT before MCAO showed smaller infarct volumes (hemisphere: 27 or 26%) at 24 h after 90 mins MCAO than did untreated castrates (37%), whereas 5 mg testosterone or 1.5 mg DHT exacerbated infarcts (53 or 51%). These outcomes were blocked by the androgen receptor antagonist, flutamide, suggesting that androgen receptors mediate these responses to ischemia. We further evaluated long-term outcomes with a milder 60-min MCAO in castrates treated with the protective 1.5 mg testosterone dose. Consistent with data obtained at 24 h reperfusion, the infarct volume was decreased at 9 days reperfusion. Neurobehavioral analysis showed that motor functional recovery was improved during the first 3 days of reperfusion, but not improved at 7 days. We conclude that testosterone exhibits dose-dependent and time-sensitive effects after ischemia and that testosterone is likely to be an important factor in sex-linked differences in cerebrovascular disease.
