 BACKGROUND: Scalp acupuncture (SA) therapy on strokes has been empirically established and widely used in clinics in China. The evidence from clinical studies suggests that SA produces significant benefits for some patients with stroke. METHODS: The effect of scalp acupuncture was studied using MRI for two different stroke models: spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone (SHR-SP) rats and rats with transiently induced focal cerebral ischaemia by middle cerebral artery occlusion for 2 h (MCAO rats). RESULTS: Stroke onset in SHR-SP rats was characterised by a development of vasogenic oedema without any appearance of cytotoxic oedema. Scalp acupuncture reduced rapidly neurological dysfunction in SHR-SP rats and reduced the volume of the vasogenic oedema during the same period. In contrast, in MCAO rats, focal cerebral ischaemia caused an immediate development of cytotoxic oedema without any appearance of vasogenic oedema. Vasogenic oedema developed after reperfusion. Scalp acupuncture had no significant effects on the cytotoxic oedema, vasogenic oedema or neurological dysfunction of the MCAO rats within the time span examined. CONCLUSION: Scalp acupuncture had a rapid and strong effect on neurological dysfunction only in the hypertensive stroke-model by reducing the vasogenic oedema. Our results suggest that, if there are similar underlying mechanisms in human strokes, scalp acupuncture may be more beneficial for patients with strokes of hypertension-caused vasogenic origin than ischaemic origin.
