Transposition of pedicled omental grafts to the brain has been shown to minimize the effects of cerebral infarction in dogs and monkeys. An experimental study in which pedicled omental grafts and free non-revascularized omental grafts were placed on the brains of rabbits is reported. With the use of a modified inhaled hydrogen clearance technique to measure blood flow in the brain tissue, it was determined that the pedicled omental graft minimized the effects of middle cerebral artery occlusion by maintaining a collateral blood supply and limiting the decline of local cerebral flow. Super-position of free omental grafts on the brain had no effect on the threshold for infarction.
