The role of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) in brain injury after cerebral ischemia has been reported; however, the spatio-temporal properties of 5-LOX expression and the enzymatic activation are unclear. To determine these properties, we observed post-ischemic 5-LOX changes from 3 h to 14 days after reperfusion in rats with transient focal cerebral ischemia induced by 30 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion. We found that the expression of 5-LOX, both mRNA and protein, was increased in the ischemic core 12-24 h after reperfusion, and in the boundary zone adjacent to the ischemic core 7-14 days after reperfusion. The increased 5-LOX was primarily localized in the neurons in the ischemic core at 24 h, but in the proliferated astrocytes in the boundary zone 14 days after reperfusion. As 5-LOX metabolites, the level of cysteinyl-leukotrienes in the ischemic brain was substantially increased 3 h to 24 h, near control at 3 days, and moderately increased again 7 days after reperfusion; whereas the level of LTB(4) was increased mildly 3 h but substantially 7-14 days after reperfusion. Thus, we conclude that 5-LOX expression and the enzymatic activity are increased after focal cerebral ischemia, and spatio-temporally involved in neuron injury in the acute phase and astrocyte proliferation in the late phase.
