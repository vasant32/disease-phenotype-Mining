The role of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 in the hematopoietic system has been well studied; however, its role in the central nervous system (CNS) response to injury is not well understood. Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated increased immunoreactivity for SHP-1 in a subset of reactive astrocytes that do not appear to enter the cell cycle following deafferentation of the chicken auditory brainstem. In order to determine whether mammalian astrocytes also upregulate SHP-1 immunoreactivity following CNS injury, a mouse model of focal cerebral ischemia was utilized to study SHP-1 expression. The brains of 3-week-old mice were analyzed at four time points following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO): 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. Our results demonstrate consistent infarct volumes within surgical groups, and infarct volumes decrease as a function of time from 1 day (maximum infarct volume) to 14 days (minimum infarct volume) post-MCAO. In addition, SHP-1 protein levels are upregulated following cerebral ischemia and this increase peaks at 7 days post-MCAO. Analysis of confocal images further reveals that immunoreactivity for SHP-1 occurs predominantly in GFAP+ reactive astrocytes, although a small percentage of F4-80+ microglia are also double labeled for SHP-1 at early times post-MCAO. These SHP-1+ reactive astrocytes do not appear to enter the cell cycle (as defined by PCNA immunoreactivity), confirming our previous studies in the avian auditory brainstem. These results suggest that SHP-1 plays an important role in the regulation of glial activation and proliferation in the ischemic CNS.
