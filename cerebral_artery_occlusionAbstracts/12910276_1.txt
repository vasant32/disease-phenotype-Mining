Intraperitoneal injection of ketamine in subanesthetic doses to Wistar rats with unilateral occlusion of the middle cerebral artery caused ipsilateral rotation (2-10 rpm), which was recorded in an automatic rotameter. The optimal dose of ketamine was 50 mg/kg. The animals were examined in an automatic rotameter for 40 min. Motor asymmetry persisted for no less than 2 months after surgery. According to the neurological test (Menzies scale) motor asymmetry in animals with focal brain ischemia persisted for no more than 30 days. The degree of ketamine-induced motor asymmetry in intact rats was 0.10 0.03 rpm.
