Using two-photon imaging techniques with monochlorobimane as a glutathione (GSH) probe, we investigated GSH levels in both core and penumbra regions of an ischemic brain after middle cerebral artery occlusion. We found that the GSH level significantly decreased in the ischemic core, but increased significantly in the penumbra. Furthermore, we observed a differential change of the GSH levels in neurons and astrocytes in the penumbra. The GSH level in neurons increased significantly whereas it decreased slightly in astrocytes in the penumbra. These findings reveal critical region and cell type-dependent changes of the GSH level in an ischemic brain.
