The substantia nigra is innervated by massive inhibitory GABAergic projections from the striatum and globus pallidus, deafferentation of which is supposed to lead to anterograde trans-synaptic degeneration of the nigral neurons. An immunohistochemical method was used to examine the induction of 72,000 mol. wt heat shock protein in the substantia nigra following cerebral hemitransection or transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. At three and four days post-transection, strong immunoreactivity for 72,000 mol. wt heat shock protein was found in the ipsilateral substantia nigra pars reticulata. Light microscopic observation revealed a number of pars reticulata neurons showing strong immunoreactivity for 72,000 mol. wt heat shock protein in their perikarya and proximal processes. In addition, Golgi-like stained neurons with dystrophic features were occasionally observed in the ipsilateral substantia nigra pars reticulata. The immunoreactivity for 72,000 mol. wt heat shock protein in the ipsilateral pars reticulata gradually declined and almost disappeared by 15 days after transection. No apparent induction of 72,000 mol. wt heat shock protein was found in the substantia nigra pars compacta throughout the time period examined. Massive striatal ischemic injury produced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion also induced expression of 72,000 mol. wt heat shock protein in the pars reticulata neurons three and four days postoperatively. These findings suggest that deafferentation of the striatal or striatopallidal inputs per se is a harmful stress for the substantia nigra pars reticulata neurons, inducing 72,000 mol. wt heat shock protein synthesis. The present data may contribute to our understanding of the molecular basis of the pathomechanism of the transneuronal regression of substantia nigra pars reticulata neurons, which may occur after removal of inhibitory GABAergic inputs.
