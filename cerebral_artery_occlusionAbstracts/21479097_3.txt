Acid-sensing ion channels, ASICs, are proton-gated cation channels widely expressed in peripheral sensory neurons and in neurons of the central nervous system that play an important role in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. To further confirm the role played by ASIC1a in cerebral ischemia, here we examined the involvement of this channel in two endogenous recently characterized neuroprotective strategies: brain ischemic preconditioning and postconditioning. The main aim of this study was to elucidate whether ASIC1a might take part as effector in the neuroprotection evoked by brain ischemic preconditioning and postconditioning. For this purpose we investigated the effect of ischemic preconditioning and postconditioning on (1) ASIC1a mRNA and protein expression in the temporoparietal cortex of rats at different time intervals; and (2) the effect of p-AKT inhibition on ASIC1a expression during ischemic preconditioning and postconditioning. Ischemic preconditioning and postconditioning were experimentally induced in adult male rats by subjecting them to different protocols of middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion. ASIC1a expression was dramatically reduced in both the neuroprotective processes. These changes in ASIC expression were p-AKT mediated, since LY-294002, a specific p-AKT inhibitor, was able to prevent variations in ASIC1a expression. The results of the present study support the idea that the downregulation of ASIC1a expression and activity might be a reasonable strategy to reduce the infarct extension after stroke.
