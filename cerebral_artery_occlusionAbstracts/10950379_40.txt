A low dose (0.5 mg/kg) of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), administered 72 hours before 60-minute middle cerebral artery occlusion, induced a delayed neuroprotection proven by the significant decrease (-35%) of brain infarct volume in comparison with control, whereas infarct volumes remained unchanged in rats treated 12, 24, or 168 hours before ischemia. This delayed neuroprotective effect of LPS was induced only with low doses (0.25 to 1 mg/kg), whereas this effect disappeared with a higher dose (2 mg/kg). The delayed neuroprotection of LPS was induced in the cortical part of the infarcted zone, not in the subcortical part. The beneficial effect of LPS on consequences of middle cerebral artery occlusion was suppressed by dexamethasone (3 mg/kg) and indomethacin (3 mg/ kg) administered 1 hour before LPS, whereas both drugs had no direct effect on infarct volume by themselves, suggesting that activation of inflammatory pathway is involved in the development of LPS-induced brain ischemic tolerance. Preadministration of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, also blocked LPS-induced brain ischemic tolerance suggesting that a protein synthesis is also necessary as a mediating mechanism. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) could be one of the synthesized proteins because lipopolysaccharide increased SOD brain activity 72 hours, but not 12 hours, after its administration, which paralleled the development of brain ischemic tolerance. In contrast, catalase brain activity remained unchanged after LPS administration. The LPS-induced delayed increase in SOD brain content was suppressed by a previous administration of indomethacin. These data suggest that the delayed neuroprotective effect of low doses of LPS is mediated by an increased synthesis of brain SOD that could be triggered by activation of inflammatory pathway.
