Acute focal ischemia was created in 10 cats by unilateral retro-orbital middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) was determined utilizing the hydrogen clearance technique from electrode recordings within the gray matter and white matter of the ectosylvian gyrus of both hemispheres. The somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) was obtained during contralateral median nerve stimulation. When the MCA was clipped the white and gray matter blood flows in the ipsilateral ectosylvian gyrus were reduced to 14.8 +/- 19.6% and 19.3 +/- 23.7% of control, and the cortical component of the SSEP was abolished. In the contralateral hemisphere an average increase of 3.5% above the control latency and a 10% mean depression in the amplitude of the cortical component of the SSEP were observed following occlusion. CBF in the contralateral hemisphere was unaffected by the MCA clip. Infusion of saline or dextran to lower the hematocrit by approximately 45% did not significantly improve blood flow or restore the SSEP in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the MCA clip. However, significant increases in the contralateral hemisphere gray matter CBF occurred following hemodilution while the latency of the cortical component of the SSEP in this same hemisphere was significantly extended. Elevations in gray and white matter blood flows were achieved in the experimental hemisphere of 3 of 10 cats suggesting a wide range of variation in the collateral circulation.
