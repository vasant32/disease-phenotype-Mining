The aim was to test the hypothesis that occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) results in the development of epilepsy in rats. Further, we investigated whether lesion volume, hippocampal pathology, early seizures, or severity of behavioral impairment is associated with the development and severity of epilepsy or interictal spiking. MCA occlusion was induced by intracerebral injection of endothelin-1 (ET; 120 pmol). One group of ET-injected rats were followed-up for 6 months (n = 15) and another for 12 months (n = 20). Sham-operated animals were injected with saline (n = 12). Occurrence of early and late seizures was monitored by intermittent video-electroencephalography. Sensorimotor function was tested with the running wheel and tapered beam-walking tests. Emotional learning and memory were assessed with the fear conditioning test and spatial learning and memory with the Morris water maze. Finally, brains were processed for histology. Only one rat developed late spontaneous seizures (i.e., epilepsy). Epileptiform interictal spiking was detected in 9 of 26 animals. Early seizures did not predict the development of epilepsy, spiking activity, or severity of behavioral impairment. Production of MCA stroke by intracerebral injection of ET was not a strong trigger of epileptogenesis in adult rats. Further studies are needed to investigate the effect of age, genetic background, and location of ET-injection on the development of hyperexcitability and the risk of post-stroke epileptogenesis.
