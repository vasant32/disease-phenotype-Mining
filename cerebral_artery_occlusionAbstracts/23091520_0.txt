Gingko biloba extract 761 (EGb 761) protects neuronal cells from ischemic brain injury via a number of neuroprotective mechanisms. Hippocalcin is a calcium sensor protein that regulates intracellular calcium concentrations and apoptotic cell death. We investigated whether EGb 761 regulates hippocalcin expression in cerebral ischemia. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with vehicle or EGb 761 (100 mg/kg) prior to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and cerebral cortex tissues were collected 24 h after MCAO. A proteomic approach demonstrated reduction in hippocalcin expression in vehicle-treated animals during MCAO, whereas EGb 761 treatment prevented injury-induced decreases in hippocalcin expression. RT-PCR and Western blot analyses indicated that EGb 761 attenuates injury-induced decrease in hippocalcin. These results suggest that the maintenance of hippocalcin during cerebral ischemia contributes to the neuroprotective role of EGb 761.
