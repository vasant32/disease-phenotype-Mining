Using tissue engineering, a complex of neural stem cells (NSCs) and collagen type I was transplanted for the therapy of cerebral ischemic injury. NSCs from E14 d rats were dissociated and cultured by neurosphere formation in serum-free medium in the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), then seeded onto collagen to measure cell adhesive ability. BrdU was added to the culture medium to label the NSCs. Wistar rats (n=100) were subjected to 2-hour middle cerebral artery occlusion. After 24 hours of reperfusion, rats were assigned randomly to five groups: NSCs-collagen repair group, NSCs repair group, unseeded collagen repair group, MCAO medium group, and sham group. Neurological, immunohistological and electronic microscope assessments were performed to examine the effects of these treatments. Scanning electronic microscopy showed that NSCs assemble in the pores of collagen. At 3, 7, 15, and 30 d after transplantation of the NSC-collagen complex, some of the engrafted NSCs survive, differentiate and form synapses in the brains of rats subjected to cerebral ischemia. Six d after transplantation of the NSC-collagen complex into the brains of ischemic rats, the collagen began to degrade; 30 d after transplantation, the collagen had degraded completely. The implantation of NSCs and type I collagen facilitated the structural and functional recovery of neural tissue following ischemic injury.
