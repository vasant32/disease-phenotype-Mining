OBJECTIVE: To investigate the inhibiting effects of interleukin-10 (IL-10) on the expression of E-selectin and L-selectin in cerebral ischemia-reperfusions. METHODS: Seventy-two adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 equal groups, cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) group undergoing middle cerebral artery occlusion with Longa's thread method, IL-10 group undergoing lateral ventricle injection of IL-10 after the establishment of I/R model, Vehicle group undergoing lateral ventricle injection of normal saline after the establishment of I/R model, and sham operation (Sham) group. Twenty-four hours later the rats were killed with their brains taken out. Immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to detect the mRNA and protein expression of E-selectin and L-selectin. RESULTS: The E-selectin and L-selectin expression levels of the I/R group were significantly up-regulated compared with the Sham group (both P < 0.05). The numbers of E-selectin and L-selectin positive vessels of the IL-10 group were 18.8 +/- 1.9/10 HP fields and 15.8 + 2.4/10 HP fields respectively, both significantly less than those of the vehicle group (24.7 +/- 2.4/10 HP fields and 20.9 + 3.3/10 HP fields respectively, both P < 0.05). The E-selectin and L-selectin gene mRNA expression levels of the IL-10 group were (0.431 +/- 0.029) and (0.318 +/- 0.048) respectively, both significantly lower than those of the Vehicle group [(0.497 +/- 0.019) and (0.433 +/- 0.087) respectively, both P < 0.05]. The E-selectin and L-selectin protein expression levels of the IL-10 group were (0.349 +/- 0.037) and (0.296 +/- 0.035) respectively, both significantly lower than those of the Vehicle group [(0.421 +/- 0.043,) and (0.348 +/- 0.044) respectively, both P < 0.05]. CONCLUSIONS: IL-10 suppresses the expression of E-selectin and L-selectin in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.
