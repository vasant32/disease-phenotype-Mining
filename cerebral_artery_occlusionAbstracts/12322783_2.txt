The present study investigated the activation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and the potential role of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) in the brain's response to focal brain ischemia in the permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) model. Phosphorylated ERK p44 and p42 were increased time-dependently and significantly 18- and 28-fold, respectively, at 24-h post-pMCAO. Similarly, IL-1beta protein levels were significantly increased with the peak at 24 h in the lesioned core of the ischemic hemisphere compared to the contralateral side. Previous studies using various stimuli have shown ERK-dependent IL-1 induction. The results from our study suggest that this relation may also exist in vivo in ischemic brain tissue. Based on the progressive nature of IL-1 induction, we hypothetized that inhibition of interleukin-converting enzyme (ICE) could provide an extended time-window for neuroprotection. Therefore, we applied N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD x fmk), an ICE blocker 3 or 6 h after pMCAO. Reductions of infarct volume, however, were not observed. Taken together with previous results, where we showed protective activity of zVAD x fmk when given immediately after pMCAO, we conclude that the time window for zVAD x fmk is less than 3 h.
