The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential efficacy of 3-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (TOF-MRA) to validate a canine ischemic stroke model. Ischemic stroke was induced through permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in 5 healthy Beagle dogs. T2-turbo spin echo images and TOF-MRA were obtained with a 1.5-T magnetic resonance system before and 3 and 10 d after MCAO. In 3 dogs, angiograms of the brain obtained at 3 d after MCAO showed complete occlusion of the MCA; in addition, T2 hyperintensities were present unilaterally in the striatocapsular and cerebral cortex lesions. Partial occlusion of the proximal part of the MCA was identified in the 2 remaining dogs, with T2 hyperintensities present only in the striatocapsular lesions. The occluded sites were confirmed at necropsy. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of TOF-MRA to provide a detailed description of intracranial arteries and aid in the evaluation of flow impairment in a canine MCAO model.
