OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation and nerve growth factor (NGF) on neurological function recovery in rats with ischemic stroke induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). METHODS: Cultured hippocampal NSCs isolated from neonate rats were labeled with BrdU. Sixty-four rats subjected to transient MCAO were randomized equally into 4 groups, namely group A (MCAO model group), group B (model group with NGF treatment, group C (model group with NSC transplantation), and group D (model group with both NGF and NSC transplantation). The neurological deficits of the rats were evaluated with neurological severity score (NSS) after the treatment, and the brain tissues were examined with immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent staining for BrdU and nestin expression. RESULTS: The NSS of rats in group D 2 and 4 weeks after transplantation was significantly lower than that in the other 3 groups (P<0.05), and the scores in groups B and C were significantly lower than those in group A (P<0.05). The number of BrdU- and nestin-positive cells was significantly greater in group B than in group A (P<0.05), and BrdU-positive cells were markedly more numerous in group D than in group C (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Both NSC transplantation and NGF treatment can obviously improve the neurological function of rats after MCAO, but their combined use shows stronger effects. NGF can promote autologous NSC activation and proliferation, with also stimulatory effect on the proliferation of transplanted NSCs.
