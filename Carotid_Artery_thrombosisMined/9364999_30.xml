<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The relation between the antithrombotic effect in vivo, and the inhibition constant (Ki) and the association rate constant (k(on)) in vitro was investigated for eight different thrombin inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The carotid arteries of anaesthetized rats were exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30808">FeCl3</z:chebi> for 1 h, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> size was determined from the amount of incorporated 125I-fibrinogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The thrombin inhibitors were given intravenously, and complete concentration- and/or dose-response curves were constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite a 50,000-fold difference between the Ki-values comparable plasma concentrations of hirudin and melagatran were needed (0.14 and 0.12 micromol l(-1), respectively) to obtain a 50% antithrombotic effect (IC50) in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there was a comparable in vitro (Ki-value) and in vivo (IC50) potency ratio for melagatran and inogatran, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results can be explained by the concentration of thrombin in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and improved inhibition by the low-molecular-weight compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight thrombin inhibitors tested, there was an inverse relationship between k(on)-values in vitro and the slope of the dose response curves in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhibitors with k(on)-values of &lt; 1 x 10(7) M(-1) s(-1) gave steep dose response curves with a Hill coefficient &gt; 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association time for inhibition of thrombin for slow-binding inhibitors will be too long to give effective antithrombotic effects at low plasma concentrations, but at increasing concentrations the association time will decrease, resulting in a steeper dose-response curve and thereby a more narrow therapeutic interval </plain></SENT>
