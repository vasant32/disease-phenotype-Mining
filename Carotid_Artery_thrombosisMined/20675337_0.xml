<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Less than 150 cases have been described in the published world literature to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: We present 6 consecutive cases of carotid FFT, identified prospectively from 5000 carotid duplex scans over a 34-month period in a single tertiary center for vascular surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 6 cases involved the left carotid bifurcation in neurologically symptomatic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 5 of the 6 cases, FFT occurred in the absence of a significantly stenosing atheromatous plaque and was not associated with an elevation in velocity on duplex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treated with surgical thromboendarterectomy, with good result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Duplex imaging can underestimate the degree of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Free-floating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> presents a challenge in diagnosis due to its rapidly evolving nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The management of FFT by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thromboendarterectomy appears to be safe and effective in limiting further focal neurological sequelae </plain></SENT>
