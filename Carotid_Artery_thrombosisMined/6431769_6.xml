<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Carotid atheroma and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> can be imaged directly on these sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intimal lesions are uniformly hypodense with respect to the carotid arterial wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Radiologic-pathologic correlation studies using human carotid arteries in a neck phantom confirm that these hypodense lesions are atheromas or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is good correlation between CT cross-sectional images and cross-sectional postmortem artery sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While a number of new computer-based methods of reformation of the carotid artery have been developed, consecutive thin slices through the carotid bifurcation display the pathologic lesions satisfactorily </plain></SENT>
