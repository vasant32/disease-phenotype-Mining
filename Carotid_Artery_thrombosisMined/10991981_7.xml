<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>546 Da) is a synthetic, selective inhibitor of human coagulation factor Xa (fXa) (K(i) = 0.52 nM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study compared the antithrombotic effects of SK549 and a series of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41033">benzamidine</z:chebi> isoxazoline fXa inhibitors with aspirin, DuP 714 (a direct thrombin inhibitor), recombinant tick <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in a rabbit model of electrically induced carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compounds were infused i.v. continuously from 60 min before electrical stimulation to the end of the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Values of ED(50) (dose that increases the carotid blood flow to 50% of the control) were 0.12 micromol/kg/h for SK549, 0.56 micromol/kg/h for aspirin, 0.14 micromol/kg/h for DuP 714, 0.06 micromol/kg/h for recombinant tick <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, and &gt;100 U/kg/h for <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The EC(50) (plasma concentration that increased blood flow to 50% of the control) for SK549 was 97 nM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unlike aspirin and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, SK549 was efficacious and, at 1.5 micromol/kg/h i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(n = 9), maintained carotid blood flow at 87 +/- 6% of control level for greater than 90 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unlike <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, SK549 inhibited ex vivo fXa activity but not ex vivo thrombin activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a highly significant correlation between K(i) (fXa) and ED(50) of a series of fXa inhibitors (r = 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>85, P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these results suggest that SK549 is a novel, potent, and effective antithrombotic agent in a rabbit model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is likely that SK549 exerts its antithrombotic effect through selective inhibition of fXa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, SK549 may be clinically useful for the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
