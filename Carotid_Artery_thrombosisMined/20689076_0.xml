<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Aging is a major risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In humans, assessing the direct effects of aging on vascular homeostasis is difficult because it occurs in the presence of other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>Arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> is the critical event in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e>; however, it is not known whether aging per se promotes its occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice represent an interesting system to address this issue because they age without spontaneously developing other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Organ chamber experiments confirmed the advanced level of aging of old mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As previously shown, old mice exhibited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e>; however, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> induced by photochemical injury was unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Arterial tissue factor expression and activity; expressions of tissue factor pathway inhibitor, thrombomodulin, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; prothrombin time; partial thromboplastin time; thrombin-antithrombin complex; and platelet activation were comparable in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although these results cannot be directly extrapolated to humans, this study contributes novel important information on the direct effect of aging on <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> and underscores the importance of controlling modifiable risk factors in aged individuals </plain></SENT>
