<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the fibrin(ogen)olytic character of FIIa isolated from Agkistrodon acutus venom in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 125I-labeled human plasma clot lysis was measured in vitro and rabbit carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was as an in vivo model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In vitro, urokinase (UK) at 25, 35, 40, 45, 60 kU/L and FIIa at 0.08, 0.23, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.7 g/L resulted an equivalent clot lysis (20%, 40%, 50%, 60%, and 80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>UK at 25 to approximately 60 kU/L induced 27.3%+/-3.6%, 35.2%+/-2.3%, 39.3%+/-2.4%, 44.2%+/-4.6%, and 51.1%+/-1.2% fibrinogen degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>But FIIa at 0.08 approximately -0.7 g/L induced 95.4%+/-0.3%, &gt;95.6%, &gt;95.6%, &gt;95.6%, &gt;95.6% fibrinogen degradation respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo, UK 40 kU/kg and FIIa 1.0 mg/kg reduced the weight of residual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> to 9.0+/-2.5 mg and 7.8+/-3.5 mg compared with negative control group (30.0+/-5.4 mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>But the fibrinogen degradation rate after UK 40 kU/kg and FIIa 1.0 mg/kg treatment was 24.4%+/-6.2% and 4.1%+/-7.8%, respectively (P&lt;0.05, n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The order of the lysis speed after UK 125 kU/L treatment was platelet poor plasma (PPP) clots&gt;the whole blood clots&gt;platelet rich plasma (PRP) clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sequence for FIIa 0.4 g/L was PRP &gt;PPP &gt;whole blood clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: At the same percentage of clot lysis, FIIa degraded more fibrinogen than UK did in vitro but less fibrinogen than UK did in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The order of the lysis speed was PPP&gt;whole blood clots&gt;PRP clots for UK and PRP&gt;PPP&gt;whole blood clots for FIIa </plain></SENT>
