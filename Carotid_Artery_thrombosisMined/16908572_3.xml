<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of our retrospective study was to investigate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of clot removal therapy by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> and extraction for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with embolic internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 814 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> admitted to our institution from March 2003 to April 2005, clot removal therapy was performed for 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were patients (1) presenting within 6 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, (2) with serious neurologic symptoms defined by a National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score of at least 11, (3) without extensive high signal intensity on diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images but with decreased ipsilateral hemispheric cerebral blood flow on perfusion-weighted images (perfusion/diffusion mismatch), and (4) with total ICA occlusion on angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We removed clots by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> and extraction with a microsnare through either a guiding or balloon guide catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Radiographic results, 7-day NIHSS, 3-month modified Rankin Scale, and procedure-related complications were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 10 patients treated with the balloon guide catheter to temporarily interrupt proximal flow, 7 obtained complete or partial recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 4 patients treated with the guiding catheter had no recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 7 patients with recanalization, 6 had favorable 7-day neurologic and 3-month functional outcome; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> showed anatomic crossflow via the anterior communicating artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A procedure-related complication, distal embolization into the ipsilateral anterior cerebral artery, occurred in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Balloon guide catheter-assisted clot removal therapy for embolic ICA occlusion may provide a high recanalization rate and good clinical outcome in patients with anatomic crossflow </plain></SENT>
