<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A retrospective review of 61 cases of angiographically confirmed occlusion of one or both carotid arteries was carried out to look at the evidence that the presence of collateral blood supply influenced the extent and type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty six patients had bilateral angiography from which it was possible to assess collateral filling of the internal carotid and middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As expected, patients with no CT scan evidence of infarction more frequently had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> or <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> than did those with visible cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with small cortical ischaemic lesions usually had appropriate neuropsychological or neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients with cortical watershed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> had a fluctuating deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with bilateral angiograms 67% showed some filling via collaterals of the middle cerebral artery, and 43% of the internal carotid artery in the siphon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Those with collateral filling were mostly found to have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CT scans or evidence of peripheral cortical lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast most watershed and full territory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were found in individuals whose angiograms showed no collateral filling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that in many cases infarction occurs despite collateral flow and is due to distal embolism and that this may be relevant to the recently reported failure of the EC/IC bypass operation </plain></SENT>
