<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>Thromboembolic events</z:hpo> are a major cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To obtain evidence for platelet embolization after cerebrovascular injury, the accumulation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">indium</z:chebi>-labeled platelets was documented after photothrombosis of the rat common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Heterologous blood was collected from donor rats, and the isolated platelets were labeled with 111In-tropolone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Labeled platelets were then infused into Wistar rats 30 minutes before right carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nonocclusive common carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was induced by a laser-driven <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi>-mediated photochemical insult to the vascular endothelium, and the rats were killed 15 minutes or 3 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carotid arteries and brains were immediately removed and dissected for regional radioactivity assessment or sectioned for the autoradiographic visualization of platelet emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 15 minutes after <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, the ratio of right-to-left common carotid artery radioactivity was significantly elevated compared with control (33 +/- 12 [mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>] versus 0.97 +/- 0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within individual brain regions, including the frontal and frontoparietal cortices and hippocampus, significant elevations in right-to-left radioactivity ratios were also documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Autoradiographic images revealed multiple foci of 111In-labeled platelets throughout the thrombosed hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the level of the frontal cortex, bilateral platelet accumulation was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Regional counts demonstrated significantly increased platelet density within selective cortical and subcortical regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the 15-minute findings, right-to-left ratios of carotid arteries or brain regional radioactivities were not significantly elevated at 3 hours after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, the areal densities of autoradiographically visualized platelets in the 3-hour group were not different from control except in the right frontal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate (1) the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> accumulation of labeled platelets in downstream vessels after nonocclusive common carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, (2) that platelet accumulation is widespread and also involves contralateral areas, and (3) that platelet accumulation within the thrombosed carotid artery and brain is largely transient </plain></SENT>
