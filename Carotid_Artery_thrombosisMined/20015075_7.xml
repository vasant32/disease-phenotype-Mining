<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Aegyptin is a 30 kDa mosquito salivary gland protein that binds to collagen and inhibits platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have studied the biophysical properties of aegyptin and its mechanism of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Light-scattering plot showed that aegyptin has an elongated monomeric form, which explains the apparent molecular mass of 110 kDa estimated by gel-filtration chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surface plasmon resonance identified the sequence RGQOGVMGF (where O is <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18095">hydroxyproline</z:chebi>) that mediates collagen interaction with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (vWF) as a high-affinity binding site for aegyptin, with a K(D) of approximately 5 nM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, aegyptin interacts with the linear <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> RGQPGVMGF and heat-denatured collagen, indicating that the triple helix and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18095">hydroxyproline</z:chebi> are not a prerequisite for binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, aegyptin does not interact with scrambled RGQPGVMGF <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aegyptin also recognizes the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (GPO)(10) and GFOGER with low affinity (microM range), which respectively represent <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> VI and integrin alpha2beta1 binding sites in collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Truncated forms of aegyptin were engineered, and the C-terminus fragment was shown to interact with collagen and to attenuate platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, aegyptin prevents laser-induced carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">Rose Bengal</z:chebi> in vivo, without significant <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, aegyptin interacts with distinct binding sites in collagen, and is useful tool to inhibit platelet-collagen interaction in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
