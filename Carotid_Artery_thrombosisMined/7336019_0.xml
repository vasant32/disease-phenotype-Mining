<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serial transversal sections plus two or more longitudinal sections enabled identification by Echo-B of the three carotid arteries, and thus the bifurcation, in 37 instances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arteriography was performed in 11 patients (21 carotid arteries) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlation between Echo-B and arteriographic findings was good in 10 cases (including 1 case of occlusion and 2 of stenosis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 3 false negatives but no false positives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Echo-B did not detect the bifurcation on either side in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The method is non-invasive, painless, and can be repeated without risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It enables the detection of stenotic and occlusive lesions with a certain degree of reliability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is also of value for demonstrating the presence of atheromatous plaques, and to some extent, irregularities in the arterial wall or variations of its diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It allows new perspectives for long-term following of patients after medical or surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
