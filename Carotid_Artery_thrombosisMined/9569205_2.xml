<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the adjunctive effect of a novel factor Xa inhibitor, YM-60828, on vessel patency and blood loss from the operation site after successful thrombolysis with a modified tissue-type plasminogen activator (moPA) in an electrically-induced carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five minutes after the induction of occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, a test drug (YM-60828, argatroban, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> or saline) was administered by i.v. bolus injection followed by continuous infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thrombolysis was induced with moPA by i.v. bolus injection at a dose of 650,000 IU/ kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>YM-60828 at 1 mg/kg i.v. followed by 3 mg/kg/h significantly prevented reocclusion, increased the duration of patency, and improved vessel patency after successful thrombolysis without any significant increase in blood loss from the operation site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Argatroban at 1 mg/kg i.v. followed by 3 mg/kg/h and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> at 300 U/kg i.v. followed by 150 U/kg/h also significantly improved these parameters, but were accompanied by a significant increase in blood loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the factor Xa inhibitor YM-60828 may be a potent and useful adjunctive agent with a lower risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications than argatroban and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
