<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In four patients this was on the clinical side of the lesion; in two the disease was in the asymptomatic carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient appeared to show a carotid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>; the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> was detected on CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, at surgery and subsequent histology, the surface of the lesion was endothelialized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The carotid CT examination is performed in the scanner "dead time" between unenhanced and enhanced head CT scans using the same contrast material for both studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The examinations covers 3-3.6 cm of the carotid bifurcation region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thin-section CT of the extracranial carotid arteries is a noninvasive examination that on preliminary evaluations appears to have sensitivity at least equal to that of carotid angiography in the detection of intimal disease </plain></SENT>
