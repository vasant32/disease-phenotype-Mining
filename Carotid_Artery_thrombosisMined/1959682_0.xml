<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sixty-six patients (72 carotid arteries) were examined after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) using Doppler colour flow imaging (DCFI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Examinations were performed 4-18 days (mean: 7 days) after surgery (32 patients, 34 arteries) or between 2 and 100 months (mean: 39 months) after CEA (34 patients, 38 arteries) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Minor vessel wall abnormalities were found in 36% in the internal carotid artery (ICA) and in 55% in the common carotid artery (CCA) or bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient had a minor residual ICA stenosis after surgery; two low-grade stenoses and three ICA-occlusions were diagnosed at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Altered flow patterns occurred most in CCA (90%) and were predominantly located adjacent to the vessel wall and in dilated vascular segments of the CCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disturbed haemodynamics in the ICA were less marked (57%) and frequently found in the central vessel lumen or diffusely distributed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that surgically induced changes of the vessel geometry and residual or recurrent vascular wall abnormalities are often associated with distinct haemodynamic disturbances, which can reliably be detected by DCFI </plain></SENT>
