<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Animal preparations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> play a crucial role in the discovery and validation of novel drug targets in vivo, aiding in the selection of new drugs for clinical evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Folts and electrolytic methods of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> are two of the most commonly used techniques to investigate drugs with novel anti-thrombotic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, these techniques often involved the use of large animals such as dogs, and their application to small animals was limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to adapt the Folts and electrolytic methods previously described in large animals to create highly reproducible, quantitative models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in mice, rats and rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Carotid artery blood flow was measured in anaesthetised mice, rats and rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the Folts-like method, a silk suture was tied around one carotid artery distal to a flow probe and tightened to cause a concentric stenosis sufficient to decrease blood flow by 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intimal damage was induced by pinching the artery at the site of stenosis using forceps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sequential formation and mechanical dislodgement of the resultant platelet-rich occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> caused cyclic carotid artery flow reductions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the electrolytic method in mice, a <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> hook electrode was placed distal to a flow probe on one carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The artery was clamped distally to the electrode to cause stasis and an electrical current (4 mA for 1.25 min) was applied before clamp release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This induced vascular injury resulting in occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> (platelet- and fibrin-rich) formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Folts-like method of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> was successfully adapted for use in mice, rats and rabbits, and the electrolytic technique for use in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Compared with larger animals, these methods are highly reproducible and ideal for pre-clinical, cost-effective, low-cost routine screening of novel anti-thrombotic drugs </plain></SENT>
