<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood in the ligated segments of the in situ veins remained mostly fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these segments, intimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> was observed after 4 weeks with apparent preservation of an endothelial lining </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Full-wall viability was maintained in 100% of the in situ veins and in 95% of the devascularized veins, but inner wall viability was lost in 30% of the in situ arteries and in 95% of the devascularized arteries </plain></SENT>
