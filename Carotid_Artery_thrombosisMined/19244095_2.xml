<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The platelet integrin receptor alpha(IIb)beta(3) plays a critical role in <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have shown previously that the octapeptide YMESRADR, corresponding to sequences 313 to 320 of the human alpha(IIb) subunit, inhibits human platelet activation and fibrinogen binding to alpha(IIb)beta(3), possibly interacting with the ligand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of YMESRADR on electrically induced carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in New Zealand white rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">Peptide</z:chebi> was administered via the femoral vein, starting 60 min before and continuing for 90 min after the electrical stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Carotid blood flow was monitored for 90 min after the electrical stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> effects on platelet aggregation, in vitro and ex vivo, and on various coagulation, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, and hemostatic parameters were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>YMESRADR significantly inhibited rabbit platelet aggregation in vitro in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is important that <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> administration in vivo, at doses ranging from 3 to 15 mg/kg, prolonged the duration of the patency of the carotid artery, and no <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was observed until the end of the study (90 min after electrical stimulation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, YMESRADR administration <z:mp ids='MP_0009549'>reduced platelet aggregation</z:mp> ex vivo and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> weight; however, these reductions reached statistical significance, compared with the control group, at the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> doses of 12 and 15 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>YMESRADR did not affect any coagulation parameter studied and the hemostatic response observed in control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, YMESRADR represents a novel antiplatelet agent that can inhibit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation effectively and carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> without causing hemorrhagic complications in a rabbit model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
