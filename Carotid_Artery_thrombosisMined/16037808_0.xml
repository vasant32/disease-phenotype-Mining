<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CEA procedures included 346 (54.5%) open CEAs with <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi> patch angioplasty and 289 (45.5%) eversion CEAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with thromboses in the reconstructed area (n=10) had the profiles of comorbidities and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0241832" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular insufficiency</z:e> grade similar to the total CEA group (p&gt;0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Differences concerned the higher rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> cases (10%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (30%) and contralateral ICA occlusions (20%) in the group of thromboses (p&gt;0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among these 10 patients, 5 underwent eversion CEA (1.44% of the total eversion CEA group) and 5 - open CEA with patch angioplasty (1.73%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 8 patients thromboses manifested as local neurological symptoms in the area supplied by the operated carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient demonstrated the progression of general cerebral symptomatology, while in the tenth patient <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was accompanied with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Urgent ultrasonography in 7 patients failed to detect a blood flow in ICA, that proved the diagnosis of ICA <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>; in 3 patients ultrasonography showed a mural <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine patients underwent reoperation in emergency, while for the tenth patient an intervention was contraindicated due to the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of middle cerebral artery, unstable clinical state (cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>) and progression of neurological symptomatology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi> arterial graft was implantedin 7 reoperated patients with ICA <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, thrombectomy from ICA was carried out in 1 patient and in another one patient a thrombectomy from reconstructed segment with <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi> patch angioplasty of the arteriotomy defect was fulfilled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 3 reoperated patients a complete resolution of neurological symptoms was evident 24 hours after intervention, in 2 patients neurological symptomatology regressed over 2-4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In another 3 reoperated patients local neurological symptoms persisted; 1 patient demonstrated postoperative progression of neurological symptomatology and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> with fatal outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The last patient, for whom a reoperation was contraindicated, died due to aggravation of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Dynamic follow-up in early postoperative period after CEA, especially in the first 6 hours, as well as an urgent duplex scanning of the reconstructed area in case of neurological symptoms development, provides timely diagnosis of postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and the success of reoperations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Adjustments to patient's cardiac status and appropriate intraoperative heparinization can decrease the risk of this complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>An urgent reoperation aimed at the restoration of carotid blood flow, immediately after the diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (provided the absence of deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>), promotes a complete or partial regression of neurological symptoms and helps to prevent a progression of cerebrovascular disturbances </plain></SENT>
