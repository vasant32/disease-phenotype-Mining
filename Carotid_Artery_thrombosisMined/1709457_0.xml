<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> operations were conducted using a shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Morbidity and mortality rates were both 0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postoperative transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> lasting for 6 hours was recognized in only four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The total percentage of correct diagnoses using intravenous DSA compared with conventional angiography was approximately 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of the non-invasive B-mode Doppler technique in measuring the degree of constriction compared with conventional angiography was 84% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The shunt was made of <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> tubing and was based on a tube 30 cm in length and 3.5 mm in diameter which was a T-shaped loop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Different sized bulbs were fixed to each end of the tube to prevent extravascular deviation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Modified bulldog clamps and Sugita clips were used for fixation in the vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measurement and electroencephalography (EEG) under contralateral Matas procedure were conducted before surgery, and cross circulation during short-term occlusion of the common carotid artery was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The emergence or increase of delta waves in EEG during occlusion was observed in six cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The rCBF of the affected middle cerebral artery territory in these patients was lower than that in patients with no increase of delta waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the mean stump pressure during surgery in cases with preoperative EEG changes was 40 mmHg and that in cases without changes was 63 mmHg; these values were significantly different.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
