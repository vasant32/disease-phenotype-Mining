<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) plays an important role in cardiovascular homeostasis, particularly in the regulation of vascular tone and the reactivity of platelets and circulating cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) acts as the principal biological target for NO and catalyses the formation of the intracellular second messenger cyclic <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi> (cGMP); activation of this enzyme is thought to be responsible for the majority of cardiovascular actions of NO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have evaluated the antiplatelet effects of a novel non-NO-based sGC activator, BAY 41-2272, in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BAY 41-2272 produced a marked inhibition of platelet aggregation in washed platelets with a potency (IC(50) approximately 100 nM) some threefold less than the NO donor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">S-nitrosoglutathione</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BAY 41-2272 also prevented aggregation in platelet-rich plasma (PRP), albeit with a much lower potency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both NO and prostacyclin exhibited synergistic activity with BAY 41-2272 to inhibit platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo, at doses of BAY 41-2272 that significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0002843'>reduced blood pressure</z:mp>, the compound had little effect on FeCl(3)-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data confirm that intraplatelet sGC activation results in inhibition of aggregation and suggests that novel non-NO-based sGC activators, which possess both hypotensive and antiplatelet activities, may be useful as therapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
