<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: New antithrombotic agents with the potential to prevent atherothrombotic complications are being developed to target receptors on platelets and other cells involved in plaque growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the antiplatelet effects of F 16618, a new non-peptidic PAR1 (thrombin receptor) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We investigated the inhibitory effect of F 16618 on human platelet aggregation ex vivo, in whole blood and washed platelets, by using a multiple-electrode platelet aggregometer based on impedance and an optical aggregometer, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Its effects on whole-blood haemostasis (clot parameters) were analysed with the ROTEM thromboelastometry device and the platelet function analyser <z:chebi fb="95" ids="53371">PFA</z:chebi>-100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A guinea-pig model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> was used to investigate its effects on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: F 16618 inhibited PAR1 <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (SFLLR-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>)-induced washed platelet aggregation ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect was concentration-dependent and exhibited a competitive inhibition profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Washed platelet aggregation, as well as P-selectin expression induced by thrombin, were significantly inhibited by 10 µM F 16618 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In whole-blood experiments, 20 µM F 16618 inhibited SFLLR-induced platelet aggregation by 49% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, it had no effect on whole-blood haemostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the guinea-pig model of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, 0.32 mg·kg(-1) F 16618 doubled the occlusion time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: F 16618 was shown to have strong antithrombotic activity in vivo and moderate antiplatelet effects ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As these effects were not associated with major effects on physiological haemostasis, this molecule is a good antiplatelet drug candidate for use either alone or in combination with current treatments </plain></SENT>
