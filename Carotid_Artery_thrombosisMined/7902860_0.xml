<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Over a 5 year period (1988-1992), 6 patients were treated by combined carotid and subclavian artery surgery, representing 0.7% of carotid interventions practised during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The carotid lesion clinical stage was 0 (2 cases), 1 (2 cases) and 3 (2 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While for the subclavian artery 4 patients were asymptomatic and 2 had vertebrobasilar syndromes, one associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of upper limb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only one patient was globally asymptomatic but the diagnosis was a prethrombotic carotid restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Radiographs showed that the atheromatous lesion of the cervical trunks was equivalent to 2.83 stenoses per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The decision to use the combined interventions was based on either the clinical condition (combined carotid and vertebrobasilar symptomatology) or hemodynamic data (improvement in subclavian flow during carotid surgery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This hemodynamic component could be determined by transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Operation consisted always of initial subclavian revascularization (1 reimplantation, 5 bypasses), followed by carotid surgery (2 grafts, 4 endarterectomies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The postoperative course was uneventful in 5 patients, the 6th patient requiring recovery surgery for early carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> without worsening of the neurologic state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean follow up was 9 months (range 1 to 27 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Combining these two interventions in this small series did not appear to increase carotid surgery complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Initial revascularization of the subclavian artery in the patient with multiple trunk lesions corrected the posterior hemodynamic supply to the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
