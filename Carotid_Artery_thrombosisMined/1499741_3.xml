<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a canine model, we investigated the effect of endothelial cell seeding on platelet deposition on endarterectomised arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirteen dogs underwent bilateral carotid intimectomy (5 cm long) and one side was seeded with an average of 2 x 10(6) viable freshly harvested endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood flow was restored 20 min after seeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the contralateral side, a sham-seeding was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Deposition of 111indium-labelled autologous platelets was studied with sequential gamma camera images 3-5 h, 1, 2, 3, 4 days and 4 weeks after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Platelet uptake was statistically reduced on the seeded side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Animals were killed at 4 weeks (nine dogs) and 5 weeks (four dogs) after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven arteries for each group were found to be occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that endothelial cell seeding on endarterectomised arteries is feasible and reduces platelet uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Improvement in the efficiency of seeding and reduction of endothelial cell loss might permit clinical application of this technique </plain></SENT>
