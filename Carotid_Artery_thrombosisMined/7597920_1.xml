<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the effect of 3,4',5-trihydroxystibene-3-beta-mono-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35436">D-glucoside</z:chebi> (Polydatin, Pol) on rabbit <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rabbit <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> was induced by vascular endothelial damage with trypsin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: It was showed that the moist weights of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> were 6.6 +/- 1.8 and 4.8 +/- 1.6 mg in Pol 5 and 10 mg.kg-1 groups, respectively, which was lighter than that in control (10.9 +/- 1.9 mg, P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01); the platelet aggregation was inhibited simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vitro, Pol 0.30-1.15 mmol.L-1 reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">TXA2</z:chebi> produced in platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It did not affect the production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> was abated by Pol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The selective inhibition of production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">TXA2</z:chebi> rather than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi>, is one of the mechanisms involved </plain></SENT>
