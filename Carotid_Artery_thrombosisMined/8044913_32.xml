<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Coronary stenting is associated with two major complications: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and neointimal proliferation resulting in restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our hypothesis is that the biocompatibility of metallic stents can be improved by coating with a polymer membrane that delivers agents that favorably modify the local arterial microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates the kinetics, distribution, and bioactivity of the model drug <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> delivered to the local arterial wall by a <z:chebi fb="82" ids="53284">polyurethane</z:chebi>-coated removable metallic stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Stents were used in rabbit carotid arteries (n = 20) for as long as 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The quantity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> bound to the stent decreased exponentially with a half-life of 5.8 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood concentrations peaked at 140 +/- 39 pg/microL at 4 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The adjacent arterial media contained 60 +/- 39 ng/mg, which was 380- and 460-fold greater than the contralateral carotid media and the systemic blood, respectively (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Media <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> concentrations declined exponentially over time with a tissue half-life of 5.0 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Drug distributed throughout the vessel wall with decreasing gradients in the radial and axial dimensions consistent with a diffusion process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Removal of the stent was associated with a 100-fold decline in media <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> concentration within 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">Forskolin</z:chebi> release was associated with a sustained 92% increase in carotid blood flow and a 60% decrease in local arterial resistance compared with coated control stents (P &lt; .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In another set of rabbits (n = 14) using a carotid crush injury, flow-reduction model, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> prolonged the time to flow variation and occlusion by 12-fold compared with the use of bare metal stents and 5-fold compared with the use of <z:chebi fb="82" ids="53284">polyurethane</z:chebi>-coated stents (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A polymer-coated metallic stent can deliver <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> to the local arterial wall in high concentrations relative to the blood or other tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>High local drug concentrations are dependent on maintaining stent-to-tissue gradients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The delivered drug is biologically active, demonstrating vasodilating and antiplatelet properties </plain></SENT>
