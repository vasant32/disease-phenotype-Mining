<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: A debate is emerging over whether the treatment time window in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> can be extended beyond 6 h if penumbral tissue can be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment decisions are very difficult in cases of tandem proximal carotid occlusion with arterioarterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752140" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We enter this debate with the present report on a case of atherosclerotic proximal carotid occlusion and resulting periocclusional carotid T embolism that was successfully treated 9 h after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The case of a 68-year-old man with fluctuating symptoms of right-hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is presented (NIHSS score 12-20 on admission) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CT angiography demonstrated proximal carotid occlusion and periocclusional embolism of the entire internal carotid artery (ICA) including the carotid T segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Penumbral tissue was diagnosed by nonenhanced and perfusion CT imaging 7.5 h after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment was initiated 9 h after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> by passing the proximal occlusion with a microcatheter and local administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) into the carotid T segment at the level of posterior communicating artery (PCoA) origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recanalization of the ICA and middle cerebral artery was accomplished within 1 h by flow establishment via the PCoA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The atherosclerotic proximal ICA occlusion was not stented due to the risk of embolism from remnant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in the petrous and cavernous ICA segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up MRI showed only mild haemorrhagic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> transformation of the initial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient was discharged from hospital 18 days after treatment with NIHSS score 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: If penumbral tissue can be conclusively identified, endovascular treatment in proximal and intracranial tandem occlusion can be successful, even in treatments initiated 6-9 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>If the intracranial flow after recanalization can be established via the circle of Willis, the underlying proximal ICA occlusion may not require treatment </plain></SENT>
