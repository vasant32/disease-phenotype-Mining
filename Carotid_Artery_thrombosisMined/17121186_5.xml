<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Administration of KRG to rats not only prevented carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in vivo in a dose-dependent manner, but also significantly inhibited <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation ex vivo, while failed to prolong coagulation times such as activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT), indicating the antithrombotic effect of KRG might be due to its antiplatelet aggregation rather than anticoagulation effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In line with the above observations, KRG inhibited U46619-, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi>-, collagen- and thrombin-induced rabbit platelet aggregation in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 620 +/- 12, 823 +/- 22, 722 + 21 and 650 +/- 14 microg/mL, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, KRG also inhibited various <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>-induced platelet <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> secretions as it suppressed platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that KRG has a potent antithrombotic effect in vivo, which may be due to antiplatelet rather than anticoagulation activity, and KRG intake may be beneficial to the individuals with high risks of thrombotic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
