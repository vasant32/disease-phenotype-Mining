<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In rats the carotid territory was embolized with a single clot formed in a <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53226,53227">polyethylene</z:chebi> tube and washed with saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen minutes after embolization 10 animals were treated with rt-PA 10 mg kg-1; 11 with 15 mg kg-1; 12 with 20 mg kg-1 and 9 with 10 mg kg-1 + 20 mg kg-1 aspirin and 34 animals with saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rt-PA 10 mg kg-1 reduced median <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (in percent of the ipsilateral hemisphere volume) from 19.5 to 4.8; rt-PA 15 mg kg-1 to 2.0; rt-PA 20 mg kg-1 to 0.0, while rt-PA 10 mg kg-1 + aspirin resulted in a median <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of 9.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thrombolytic therapy significantly and dose dependently (p = 0.001) reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, improved the presacrifice clinical score and increased (p = 0.02) angiographically verified reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no additional benefit of coadministration of aspirin </plain></SENT>
