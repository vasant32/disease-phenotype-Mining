<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is widely believed that atherosclerotic plaque rupture and subsequent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> leads to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, study of the mechanism and treatment of human plaque rupture is hampered by lack of a suitable animal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to develop a novel animal model of atherosclerotic plaque rupture to facilitate the study of human plaque disruption and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 28 healthy male New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into two groups: rabbits in group A (n = 12) were only fed a high-fat diet for eight weeks; rabbits in group B (n = 16) underwent cold-induced endothelial injury with liquid nitrogen, then were given a high-fat diet for eight weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After completion of the preparatory regimen, triggering of plaque rupture was attempted by local injection of liquid nitrogen in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rabbits in group B had disrupted plaques or rupture-driven occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, but none in group A showed any effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More importantly, the cold-induced plaques in our model were reminiscent of human atherosclerotic plaques in terms of architecture, cellular composition, growth characteristics, and patterns of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We successfully developed a novel rabbit model of atherosclerotic plaque rupture and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, which is simple, fast, inexpensive, and reproducible, and has a low mortality and a high yield of triggering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This model will allow us to better understand the mechanism of human plaque rupture and also to develop plaque-stabilizing therapies </plain></SENT>
