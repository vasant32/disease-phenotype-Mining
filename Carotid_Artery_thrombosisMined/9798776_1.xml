<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MRI has been reported to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> better than CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether MRI influenced the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> diagnosis and management of TBI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A retrospective medical records review was performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> TBI patients undergoing cerebral CT scan and MRI admitted to a regional trauma center during a 2-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient data collected included demography, extent of TBI, CT scan and MRI use, and therapeutic interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty TBI patients (initial Glascow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale, 8.8+/-0.7) underwent 79 CT scans and 40 MRIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Time to initial CT scan was 6.3+/-4.3 hours and time to MRI was 2.9+/-3.1 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (22.5%) had injuries on CT scan but not on MRI, most commonly skull fractures or small <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhages</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients (60%) had injuries on MRI but not on CT scan, most commonly corpus callosum shear injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were two cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1541830,C0008060" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">child abuse</z:e> and both had injuries of varying ages identified by MRI, but not CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> injuries requiring a therapeutic intervention or change in management were identified by CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance angiography identified one patient with a traumatic internal carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The performance of MRI resulted in additional charges of $75,640 or $3,152/patient identified with a new lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although MRI identifies lesions not evident on CT scan, MRI does not alter management plans and is of limited value in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> management of TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>MRI may be of medicolegal benefit in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1541830,C0008060" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">child abuse</z:e> </plain></SENT>
