<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the results of urgent thrombolytic treatment of patients with major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in this clinical category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical findings and outcome in 33 patients were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had suffered a major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, with a score of 24 or higher on the NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ischemic abnormalities were not detected on initial CT studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses were made at angiography, and patients were treated by intravenous or intraarterial local thrombolysis within 6 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recanalization was accomplished in eight patients with intraarterial local thrombolysis; four of these patients had a good clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two factors characteristic of those whose treatment was successful were dramatic improvement of symptoms after partial recanalization achieved within 3 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and stabilized improvement after subsequent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or carotid endarterectomy for residual atherosclerotic stenosis at the ICA origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that urgent intraarterial local thrombolysis may be a successful treatment method for some patients in this critical clinical category if the treatment can be accomplished within 3 hours of ictus and followed by either angioplasty or endarterectomy for residual stenosis </plain></SENT>
