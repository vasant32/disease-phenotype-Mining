<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We aimed to analyse the course of early recanalization and corresponding functional outcome in patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusion of the carotid T who were treated conservatively or underwent intravenous thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-two patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusion of the carotid T within 6 h were recruited from consecutive admissions to a neurological department participating in the Duplex Sonography in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent a standardized admission and follow-up procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Colour-coded duplex sonography was performed on admission, 30 min after thrombolysis, and at 6 and 24 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recanalization of the carotid T was classified as complete, partial and absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome was rated with the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 3 months as favourable (mRS 0-2) or poor (mRS 3-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Within 6 h, complete or partial recanalization occurred in 1 of 27 patients treated conservatively and in 6 of 15 thrombolysed patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intravenous thrombolysis predicted early recanalization also after adjustment for age, sex, cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> aetiology and time to treatment (adjusted odds ratio, OR, 39.7; 95% confidence interval, CI, 2.0-801.7; p = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An early recanalization was the only selected predictor of a favourable outcome (OR, 13.6; 95% CI, 1.0-179.0; p = 0.047) at regression analysis, and was achieved in 3 thrombolysed patients but in none with conservative medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients treated conservatively, functional outcome is poor and early recanalization rarely occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The latter can be achieved by intravenous thrombolysis with a rate comparable to that found at an intra-arterial approach without major <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Early recanalization is associated with a better functional outcome </plain></SENT>
