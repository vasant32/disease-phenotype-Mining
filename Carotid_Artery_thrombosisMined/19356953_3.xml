<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to examine the relationship between thrombomodulatory gene expression, timing of clinical events and plaque histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN OF STUDY: Plaques were obtained from 40 consecutive patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy and divided into three groups (group 1, early symptomatic, within 1 month; group 2, late symptomatic, 1-6 months and group 3, asymptomatic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was isolated to determine the expression of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), urokinase plasminogen activator (u-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), tissue factor (TF), tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), thrombomodulin (TM), CD68 and vascular endothelial-cadherin (VE-Cadherin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Expression of t-PA, PAI-1, TF, TFPI, TM, CD68 and VE-cadherin were significantly increased in the early symptomatic group (p=0.019, 0.028, 0.018, 0.025, 0.038, 0.016 and 0.027 respectively), but the level of gene expression in the late symptomatic group was indistinguishable from the asymptomatic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of plaque rupture and intraplaque haemorrhage was significantly increased in the early symptomatic groups (58% versus 18%/18% group 2/3, and 55% versus 6%/9% respectively, p&lt;0.05 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Expression of thrombomodulatory genes is increased in unstable plaques, though levels after 1 month are comparable to asymptomatic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This transient rise may influence plaque instability, and rapid resolution mirrors the clinical reduction in risk of further thrombo-embolic events </plain></SENT>
