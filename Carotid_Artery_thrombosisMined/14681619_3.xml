<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These emboli can be detected by intraoperative transcranial Doppler monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They are not linked to technical error and are variable between patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As it is known that platelets play a key role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, it was hypothesized that a patient's risk of postoperative carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was linked to the individual's platelet response to physiologic <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood samples from 120 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy were analyzed before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Platelet aggregation was measured in response to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>) (0.5 to 4 micromol/L), collagen (10 to 50 mg/mL), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> (3 or 6 micromol/L), and fibrinogen binding to GPIIb-IIIa was measured by whole blood flow cytometry in response to <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> (0.1 to 10 micromol/L) and thrombin (0.02 to 0.16 micro/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent intraoperative transcranial Doppler monitoring for 3 hours after surgery, and platelet functional data of those who had &gt;25 emboli in this period (n = 22) were compared with the data of those with &lt;25 emboli (n = 88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The platelet response to <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> was significantly higher in the patients with &gt;25 emboli, as measured both by aggregometry (P =.0012) and by flow cytometry (P &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Platelet aggregation with collagen was also significantly higher in this group (P =.0018), but the response to thrombin was not statistically different in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was no difference in the response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The platelet response to <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> may be linked to clinical outcome, and thus, specific <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> receptor inhibitors may be appropriate for this group of patients </plain></SENT>
