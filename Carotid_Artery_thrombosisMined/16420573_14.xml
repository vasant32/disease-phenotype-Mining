<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we describe the development of a murine model of vena cava <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and its use to characterize the antithrombotic activity of potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor (PCI) of TAFIa (activated TAFI) in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS/RESULTS: Vena cava <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was induced by various concentrations of FeCl(3) in C57BL/6 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A relatively mild stimulus (3.5% FeCl(3)) induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> that was consistent and sensitive to reference antithrombotic agents such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dose-response studies identified a PCI dose (5 mg kg(-1) bolus plus 5 mg kg(-1) h(-1), i.v.) that produced a maximum 45% decrease in vena cava <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> mass as assessed by protein content (n = 8, P &lt; 0.01 compared to vehicle) in the 3.5% FeCl(3)-induced model without exogenous tissue plasminogen activator administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, PCI had no effect on 3.5% FeCl(3)-induced carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a tail transection <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> model, the 5 mg kg(-1) bolus plus 5 mg kg(-1) h(-1) dose of PCI increased tail-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time up to 3.5 times control (n = 8, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ex vivo activity of antithrombotic doses of PCI was also demonstrated by the enhanced lysis of whole blood clots formed in a thrombelastograph with the addition of a sub-threshold concentration of tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These studies provide evidence for a role of TAFIa in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in mice, and describe an optimized vena cava injury model appropriate for the evaluation of antithrombotic drugs and the characterization of novel therapeutic targets </plain></SENT>
