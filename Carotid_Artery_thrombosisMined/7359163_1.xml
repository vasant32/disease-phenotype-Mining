<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 16 arteries thought suitable for endarterectomy had abnormal Doppler images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Imaging of the external carotid artery was less reliable and disease of the common carotid artery was too infrequent to allow imaging to be satisfactorily evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This non-invasive technique may eventually replace selective carotid angiography in some patients </plain></SENT>
