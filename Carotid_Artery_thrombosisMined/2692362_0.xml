<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 30 patients were studied: 19 with occlusion of internal carotid artery (ICA) or common carotid artery (CCA), 11 with uni- and bilateral kinking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical examination, ultrasound Doppler sonography and Duplex examination of extracranial arteries, TCD, and cerebral angiography were applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that the degree of the developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> and the character of clinical manifestations depended on the functional capacities of collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Its possible sources and pathways in cases of occlusion of major cerebral arteries are discussed </plain></SENT>
