<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were from English Hospital Episode Statistics (2000-2005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Admissions were classified as elective or emergency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Risk-adjusted data were analysed through modelling of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate, complication rate and length of admission with regard to the year of procedure and annual hospital volume of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hospitals with elevated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates were identified and the evidence quantified that they had outlying mortality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 280,081 diagnoses of extra-cranial atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> in which 18,248 CEA were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean mortality rates were 1.04% for elective and 3.16% for emergency CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A volume-related improvement in mortality (p=0.047) was seen for elective CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Length of stay decreased as annual volume increased for elective and emergency CEA (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>20% of the operations were performed in 67.1% of the hospitals, each of which performed fewer than 10 CEA per annum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A number of hospitals had elevated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Volume-related improvements in outcome were demonstrated for elective CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Minimum volume-criteria of 35 CEA per annum should be established in England </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Hospitals performing low annual volumes of surgery should consider arrangements to network services </plain></SENT>
