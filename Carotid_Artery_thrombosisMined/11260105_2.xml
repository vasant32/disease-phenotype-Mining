<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is usually secondary to technical error, which may be related to the experience of the operator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this retrospective study the clinical and technical outcome of carotid endarterectomies performed by one consultant and five trainees were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Some 149 patients underwent carotid endarterectomy; 89 were operated on by the consultant and 60 by trainees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative duplex imaging of the carotid repair was performed before wound closure, and re-exploration was carried out when there was a residual severe stenosis associated with an intimal flap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference in clinical outcome between operations done by consultant or trainees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase in the number of stenoses, kinks and flaps in carotid endarterectomies performed by trainees compared with those of the consultant both before (chi2 = 12.0, 1 d.f., P &lt; 0.001) and after (chi2 = 10.1, 1 d.f., P &lt; 0.001) correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intraoperative duplex imaging may facilitate training by providing an objective assessment of the quality of the operation </plain></SENT>
