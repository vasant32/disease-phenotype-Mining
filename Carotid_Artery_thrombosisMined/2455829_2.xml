<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hemorheological properties and plasma protein levels were studied pre- and postoperatively over a period of 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In comparison to age-matched healthy controls preoperative plasma viscosity, red cell aggregation, fibrinogen, haptoglobin and alpha-1-antitrypsin were significantly elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After surgical trauma there was an increase in fibrinogen, alpha-1-antitrypsin, haptoglobin and ceruloplasmin, whereas alpha-2-macroglobulin, immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin G decreased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma viscosity, red cell aggregation, red cell filterability, fibronectin and immunoglobulin M remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
