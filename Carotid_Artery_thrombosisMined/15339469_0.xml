<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of PUW (a fraction containing 60% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3884">corilagin</z:chebi> from a Chinese herbal plant Phyllanthus urinaria) on <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and coagulation system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Myers's method was used to evaluate the protection of intravenously administered PUW against the male mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> caused by injection of 75 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> in the tail vein; Charlton's method was modified to observe antithrombotic effect of PUW in rat electrically stimulated carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model; and the model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was produced to investigate the antithrombotic effect of PUW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rosette assay was used to observe the effect of PUW on platelet-neutrophil <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of PUW were monitored on euglobulin lysis time (ELT), prothrombin time (PT), kaolin partial thromboplastin time (KPTT), and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time (BT) in rats, according to the methods of Kowalski, HUANG Zheng-Liang, and GU Yue-Fang, et al, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results showed that PUW administered intravenously significantly decreased the mouse mortality, prolonged the occlusion time of rat carotid arteries, and reduced the wet and dry <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> weight of the inferior vena cava, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PUW markedly inhibited the binding of activated platelets to neutrophils, obtaining 39.7 mg/L of the medium inhibitory concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intravenously administered PUW significantly shortened ELT, prolonged KPTT while had no influence on PT; PUW increased BT in rat tail tips but the BT caused by PUW was much shorter than that by aspirin or urokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is suggested that PUW has the potential of antithrombosis due to its inhibition of platelet-neutrophil <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PUW shows the tendency to <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, however, it could not cause serious <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> side effect as compared with aspirin or urokinase </plain></SENT>
