<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Our objectives were to quantify the thrombogenicity and extent of vascular injury created by slotted-tube geometry stainless steel and nitinol coronary stents in a rabbit carotid artery model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Stents were implanted in rabbit right carotid arteries without antiplatelet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stainless steel stents were implanted for 4 days while nitinol stents were placed for 4 and 14 days (n = 8, 8, and 6, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was assessed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> weight, grading <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> encroachment of the lumen, and by blood flow in the stented and contralateral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stainless steel stents at 4 days contained more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> than 4- and 14-day nitinol stents (20.0 +/- 5.9 versus 2.5 +/- 0.6 and 2.7 +/- 0.3 mg, respectively; P &lt; .000001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stainless steel stents were more often occluded by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> (6 of 8) or contained more subocclusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> (2 of 8) than nitinol stents (0 of 14, P &lt; .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Resting blood flow was reduced in arteries with stainless steel stents compared with 4- and 14-day nitinol stents (1.5 +/- 2.8 versus 24.0 +/- 2.0 and 25.5 +/- 1.9 mL/min, respectively, P &lt; .000001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stainless steel stents were less uniformly expanded, had deeper strut penetration into the vascular wall, and were associated with more extensive medial smooth muscle cell <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were strong correlations (r = .77 to .95) between variables of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> extent (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> weight and grade) and histologically determined vascular injury (strut penetration and medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Slotted-tube stainless steel stents were more thrombogenic and created more extensive vascular injury than nitinol stents in a rabbit carotid artery model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms underlying these differences probably are related to metallurgic and design geometry properties of the two stent types </plain></SENT>
