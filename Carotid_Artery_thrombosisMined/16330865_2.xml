<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> (CI), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, peripheral artery disease (PAD) and aortic atheroma are the main clinical manifestations of atherothrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Long-term prevention after CI of atherothrombotic origin may require preventive measures at other sites, such as specific drug therapies, surgery, or angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore the detection of other locations is potentially important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to describe the other locations of atherothrombosis in patients hospitalized for a recent cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> of atherothrombotic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary objectives were to describe their vascular risk factor profiles, and their management before and after the cerebral event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHOD: This prospective, observational, multicenter survey was conducted in France between September 2003 and July 2004, mainly in neurological departments and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 753 patients were included (74% men; mean age 69.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Previous coronary events had occurred in 119 (16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> had occurred in 233 (31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PAD was already known in 109 (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A search for other atherothrombotic locations was positive in 216 patients (29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The minimum prevalence for any associated atherothrombotic location (either present before or identified during hospitalization) was 47.5% for any location, 33.7% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, 16.6% for aortic atheroma, and 22.7% for PAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Fifty percent of the patients with recent atherothrombotic CI have other locations of atherothrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For this reason, a systematic search for these other locations is recommended because of the possible therapeutic consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, the question of the most appropriate period for this search after the cerebral event remains unsettled </plain></SENT>
