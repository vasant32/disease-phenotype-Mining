<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory potencies of these compounds toward tissue plasminogen activator, plasmin and factor Xa were minimal; however, substantial cross-reactivity versus trypsin was observed (Ki values from 0.5 to 1500 nM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of thrombin by alpha-keto <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36586">carbonyl compounds</z:chebi> appeared to occur via a one-step reversible reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The alpha-keto <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi> inhibitors bound thrombin with a second order rate constant (k1 1-4 microM-1s-1) that was 10-100-fold slower than that expected for a diffusion-controlled reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Certain alpha-keto <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi> inhibitors were as potent (on a weight basis) as hirudin when evaluated in a rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The modest oral bioavailability (10-19%) in rats demonstrated for three of the alpha-keto <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi> thrombin inhibitors suggests the possibility that alpha-keto <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">amide</z:chebi> containing thrombin inhibitors may have utility as orally-active antithrombotic agents </plain></SENT>
