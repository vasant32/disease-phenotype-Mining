<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Variations in plaque composition, particularly an increased <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> concentration, could make carotid plaques unstable and prone to embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate this hypothesis, 35 carotid bifurcation plaques from 31 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (20 symptomatic, 11 asymptomatic) were prospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plaque total <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>, cholesterol, collagen, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> content were determined, and the plaque collagen was fractionated into pepsin-soluble collagen (PSC) (indicative of less crosslinked, more recently synthesized collagen) and pepsin-insoluble collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preoperative serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> levels were also obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results revealed that plaques removed from symptomatic patients contained significantly more total <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and cholesterol (P less than 0.001) than those removed from asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was also an increased amount of pepsin-soluble collagen in symptomatic plaques, potentially indicating increased metabolic activity (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, mean plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> was higher in symptomatic patients than in asymptomatic patients (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-laden plaques can potentially be identified by B-mode ultrasound, it may be important to remove these plaques in asymptomatic patients or, alternatively, to attempt to lower the plaque cholesterol by <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering maneuvers </plain></SENT>
