<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to determine the effect of inhibitors of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1, COX-2, and the nonselective COX inhibitor naproxen on coronary vasoactivity and thrombogenicity under baseline and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS)-induced inflammatory conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that endothelial COX-1 is the primary COX isoform in the canine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> coronary artery, which mediates <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> (AA)-induced vasodilatation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, COX-2 can be induced and overexpressed by <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> and becomes the major local COX isoform responsible for the production of antithrombotic <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandins</z:chebi> during systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The interventions included the selective COX-1 inhibitor SC-560 (0.3 mg/kg iv), the selective COX-2 inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44445">nimesulide</z:chebi> (5 mg/kg iv), or the nonselective COX inhibitor naproxen (3 mg/kg iv) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The selective prostacyclin (IP) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> RO-3244794 (RO) was used as an investigational tool to delineate the role of prostacyclin (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="26345">PGI</z:chebi>(2)) in modulating vascular reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AA-induced vasodilatation of the left circumflex coronary artery was suppressed to a similar extent by each of the COX inhibitors and RO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that AA-induced vasodilatation in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> coronary artery is mediated by a single COX isoform, the constitutive endothelial COX-1, which is reported to be susceptible to COX-2 inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect of the COX inhibitors on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation was evaluated in a model of carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> secondary to electrolytic-induced vessel wall injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with LPS (0.5 mg/kg iv) induced a systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> and prolonged the time-to-occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, which was reduced in the LPS-treated animals by the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44445">nimesulide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, neither SC-560 nor naproxen influenced the time to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the animals pretreated with LPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The data are of significance in view of reported adverse cardiovascular events observed in clinical trials involving the use of selective COX-2 inhibitors, thereby suggesting that the endothelial constitutive COX-1 and the inducible vascular COX-2 serve important functions in maintaining vascular homeostasis </plain></SENT>
