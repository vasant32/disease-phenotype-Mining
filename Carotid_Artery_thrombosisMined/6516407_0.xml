<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Statistical correlations were sought between the clinical data, the neurological signs and the results of angiography in 224 patients who had had panangiography for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With advancing age there is an increase in the incidence of stenosis, but not of occlusion in the cervical portion of the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients who suffer from peripheral or coronary occlusive artery disease have a higher incidence of stenosis and occlusion of the cervical carotid artery, but most are clinically silent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If there is a cardiac source of embolism, the main lesions are found in the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of middle cerebral artery branch occlusions is elevated in areas distal to stenosis and occlusion of the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More than half of the patients whose neurological deficit augmented over a period exceeding one day have lesions in the cervical carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The degree of narrowing of the carotid or middle cerebral artery shows a negative correlation with neurological recovery, but in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> with recovery under one hour there is a high incidence of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As to the neurologic symptoms there was a clear difference between the findings in medial cerebral artery <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and those in vertebrobasilar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the findings in the former condition show a positive correlation with the gravity of the deficit, whilst those of the vertebrobasilar artery correlate with the symptoms of a lacunar state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>9 of 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> had lesions of the ipsilateral carotid artery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
