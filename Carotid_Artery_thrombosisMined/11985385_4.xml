<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Little is known about the natural course of internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion and its possible recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to evaluate recanalization rates of extracranial ICA occlusions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients by means of color-coded duplex sonography (CCDS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 305 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the territory of the middle cerebral artery were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a neurological examination on admission and on discharge and were rated by means of the European <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Extracranial color-coded duplexsonography, transcranial Doppler sonography and cranial computed tomography were immediately performed after admission and within 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 254 patients showed no sign of hemodynamic relevant stenosis greater than 70% of the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>21 patients had symptomatic high grade ICA stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>20 patients had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusion and 10 patients an old ICA occlusion as judged by duplex sonographic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients (5 male, 1 female; age range 57 to 77 years) with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> atherothrombotic or cardioembolic occlusion showed a recanalization of the ICA in the follow-up ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients with cardiogenic embolic occlusion of the ICA had the most favorable outcome and these patients showed no residual stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>4 patients who had ultrasound findings consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> on follow-up examination (2 high-grade stenosis, 2 with carotid plaques) did not show a notable improvement of their <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESS</z:e>-score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with carotid plaques developed complete <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarctions; the other 4 patients had partial anterior circulation infarction on follow-up CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that recanalization of the occluded ICA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients is more frequent than generally presumed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CCDS should be routinely performed in the follow-up of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients as spontaneous recanalization may influence clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
