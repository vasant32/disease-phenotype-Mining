<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>10% of the patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> had a contralateral occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Corresponding to the side of occlusion most patients had a preoperative neurological stage IV (55%, 19% stage II, 26% stage I) and corresponding to the side of stenosis most patients had a stage I (57%, 28% stage II, 4% stage III, 12% stage IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to the stenosis the occlusion had been operated on in 7 patients, in 5 of them the revascularisation was not possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 88% the arteriotomy could be closed using a venous patch and in 97% a intraluminal shunt was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> operations were done under general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The early <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> rate was 10%, in one patient a postoperative neurological deficit occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The late mortality rate was 21%, in 5% a new neurological deficit could be found (n = 57, mean follow-up: 3.0 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In relation to the preoperative neurological stage corresponding to the side of stenosis the highest mortality rate was found in patients with stage IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a separate analysis of two periods (1962-1978 and 1979-1981) it can be demonstrated that the high early mortality rate is nearly entirely found in the first period with a low operative frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the second period 1979-1981, 33 carotid endarterectomies in patients with contralateral occlusion were operated with a mortality rate of 3%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
