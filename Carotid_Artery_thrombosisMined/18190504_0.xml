<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Mechanical clot extraction up to 8 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> is an alternative strategy for opening large vessels, especially for patients ineligible for intravenous thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Safety beyond this therapeutic window is untested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An 81-year-old woman presented 8 hours after she developed left-sided <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> with a National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score fluctuating between 6 and 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging revealed a large perfusion deficit with no diffusion abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An emergent cerebral angiogram revealed a complete internal carotid artery terminus occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Successful mechanical thrombectomy was performed without complication and resulted in almost complete reversal of the patient's deficit to an NIHSS score of 1, 10 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with large hypoperfused areas and minimal diffusion abnormalities on the MRI may benefit from mechanical thrombectomy beyond an 8-hour window </plain></SENT>
