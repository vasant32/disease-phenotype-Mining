<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Careful review of the late films of their initial arteriographic series or repeat arteriography with a specialized technique revealed a thin trickle of contrast medium flowing antegrade through a region of extreme stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This thin line of contrast material ascended slowly to meet the column of contrast medium in the cavernous carotid segment that was filling by collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgical exploration of the neck in these patients revealed a patent but collapsed ICA distal to a localized atheromatous plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients have been asymptomatic following carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This distinctive angiographic appearance may be described as "atheromatous pseudo-occlusion." Once recognized, carotid endarterectomy is the logical treatment of choice </plain></SENT>
