<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For each drug group (n = 6), the right carotid artery was used as control vessel and resulting occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was kept in situ to examine the direct thrombolytic efficacy of the <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes after occlusion of control vessel, a low or high dose of each <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> was administered and the left carotid artery was used as test vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> control vessels occluded within 86-96 min in response to electrolytic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of occlusion with lower doses of m7E3, DMP-728, and MK-383 was 100, 33 and 100%, respectively; corresponding times to occlusion were 174, 220 and 118 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lower doses inhibited <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>- or AA-induced platelet aggregation in cPRP (&gt;80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incidence of occlusion with high doses of m7E3, DMP-728 and MK-383 was 33, 0 and 0%, respectively; corresponding times to occlusion were 209, &gt;240 and &gt;240 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher doses inhibited aggregation in cPRP (&gt;80%), but only partially in hPRP (45-66%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dose-dependent prolongation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time occurred with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that ex vivo platelet aggregation conducted in hPRP, as opposed to conventional cPRP, provides a better assessment of the in vivo efficacy of GPIIb/IIIa receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
