<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it would be valuable to identify atherothrombosis and vulnerable plaques before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of such clinical events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether the noninvasive in vivo visualization of activated platelets was effective when using a target-specific MRI contrast agent to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, hallmarks of vulnerable or high-risk atherosclerotic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were induced in mice via topical application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> on the carotid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Thrombus</z:e> formation was imaged with intravital fluorescence microscopy and molecular MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To accomplish the latter, a paramagnetic contrast agent (P975) that targets the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> alpha(IIb)beta(3), expressed on activated platelets, was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The specificity of P975 for activated platelets was studied in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vivo, high spatial-resolution MRI was performed at baseline and longitudinally over 2 hours after injecting P975 or a nonspecific agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The contralateral carotid, a sham surgery group, and a competitive inhibition experiment served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>P975 showed a good affinity for activated platelets, with an IC(50) (concentration of dose that produces 50% inhibition) value of 2.6 micromol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In thrombosed animals, P975 produced an immediate and sustained increase in MRI signal, whereas none of the control groups revealed any significant increase in MRI signal 2 hours after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>More important, the competitive inhibition experiment with an alpha(IIb)beta(3) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> suppressed the MRI signal enhancement, which is indicative for the specificity of P975 for the activated platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: P975 allowed in vivo target-specific noninvasive MRI of activated platelets </plain></SENT>
