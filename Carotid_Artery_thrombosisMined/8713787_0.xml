<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used a parallel-plate flow chamber, which was connected to the femoral artery of the rat, to measure platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A collagen-coated arterioarterial shunt between two carotid arteries was used to measure shunt patency duration as an index of antithrombotic efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), vitamin E, and the combination of these two were intravenously administered for 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurements were performed before drug administration, and at 30, 60, 120 min after the initiation of drug infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results indicated that (1) treatments with t-PA or t-PA/vitamin E prolonged the time to shunt occlusion at 30 and 60 min; (2) t-PA enhanced platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> at 60 and 120 min; (3) vitamin E tended to reduce platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>; (4) t-PA/vitamin E reduced the t-PA-enhanced platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>; (5) at the high-density area of platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> under t-PA treatment, the adherent platelets demonstrated severe morphological changes which could be blocked by vitamin E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that t-PA may enhance platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> in rats and that this adverse effect can be suppressed by co-administration of vitamin E </plain></SENT>
