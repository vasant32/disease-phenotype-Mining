<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 48 rats were used, and divided into three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first group (A) was used as a control with no medical agent being used after anastomosis, the second group (B) was medicated with aspirin, and the third group (C) was medicated with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each group, four rats were sacrificed serially on every post-operative 3, 5, 10 and 15 days after arterial anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patency and histologic evaluations at the anastomotic site were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results revealed that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(1) therapied group showed highest patency rate (100%), lesser formation of mural <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and also minimal changes in the intimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> and medial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From these findings, we could conclude that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(1) has superior effect on maintaining the patency after microvascular surgery </plain></SENT>
