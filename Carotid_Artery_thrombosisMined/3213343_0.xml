<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patent anastomoses were marked by two types of changes occurring on the polarograms in clamping of the donor artery of the anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They reflect the relations between the EICMA and the natural channels of the collateral blood supply of the brain, correlate to a great measure with the localization of the occluding lesions in the cerebral vessels, and allow the efficacy of the operative intervention to be predicted </plain></SENT>
