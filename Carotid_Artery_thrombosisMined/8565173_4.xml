<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Currently used antiplatelet drugs, including aspirin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi>, are effective against certain but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the many endogenous platelet activators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of their limited efficacy, a significant number of serious thromboembolic complications still occur, highlighting the need for a more effective therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DMP 728 has been characterized as a potent and specific platelet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa complex (GPIIb/IIIa) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The goals of the present study were to determine the oral antiplatelet and antithrombotic efficacies of DMP 728 in various <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> models in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In conscious and anesthetized mongrel dogs, DMP 728 at 0.02 to 1.0 mg/kg PO in gelatin capsules produced dose-dependent antiplatelet effects in inhibiting ex vivo platelet aggregation induced by <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> and prolonging template <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DMP 728 effects on <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time prolongation could be reversed more rapidly than those on platelet aggregation inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A maximal antiplatelet effect for DMP 728 was demonstrated at 1.0 mg/kg PO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DMP 728 demonstrated dose-dependent oral antiplatelet effects with an absolute oral bioavailability of 8% to 12% in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the antithrombotic efficacy of DMP 728 was examined after intravenous and oral administration at different doses in various models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the coronary artery Folts' model in dogs, DMP 728 demonstrated maximal antithrombotic efficacy at 0.01 mg/kg IV and &lt; 0.6 mg/kg PO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, DMP 728 at 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg IV or PO demonstrated 60% to 100% prevention of primary <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (P &lt; .01) in an electrolytically induced carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that DMP 728, a low-molecular-weight GPIIb/IIIa receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, may have therapeutic potential as an oral antithrombotic agent in coronary and carotid artery thromboembolic disorders </plain></SENT>
