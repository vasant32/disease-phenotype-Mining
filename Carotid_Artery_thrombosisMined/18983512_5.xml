<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Atherothrombosis is a major cause of cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, animal models to study this process are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We describe the first murine model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation upon plaque rupture to study atherothrombosis by intravital fluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Localized rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque in a carotid artery from Apoe(-/-) mice was induced in vivo using ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rupture of the plaque and formation of localized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were verified by two-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM) in isolated arteries, and by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The thrombotic reaction was quantified by intravital fluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Inspection of the ultrasound-treated plaques by histochemistry and TPLSM demonstrated local damage, collagen exposure, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation as well as intra-plaque intrusion of erythrocytes and fibrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound treatment of healthy carotid arteries resulted in endothelial damage and limited platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Real-time intravital fluorescence microscopy demonstrated rapid platelet deposition on plaques and formation of a single <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> that remained subocclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The thrombotic process was antagonized by thrombin inhibition, or by blocking of collagen or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> receptor pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were formed in 70% of mice lacking CD40L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Targeted rupture of murine plaques results in collagen exposure and non-occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The thrombotic process relies on platelet activation as well as on thrombin generation and coagulation, and is sensitive to established and novel antithrombotic medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This model provides new possibilities to study atherothrombosis in vivo </plain></SENT>
