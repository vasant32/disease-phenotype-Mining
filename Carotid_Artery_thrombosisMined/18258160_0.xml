<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The factor V Leiden (FVL) mutation has been demonstrated to be associated with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether such a propensity also exists in the arterial circulation remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In an effort to minimize the variability that clouds the clinical study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, we studied FVL-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in an experimental model of homozygous, heterozygous, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Heterozygous FVL mice were crossbred to C57BL/6J mice over several generations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The genotypes of the resulting three genotype groups (<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp>, heterozygous FVL, and homozygous FVL) were blinded to the investigators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arterial injury was produced with the injection of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30808">ferric chloride</z:chebi> into an isolated segment of carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>Arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> was assessed with an ultrasonic flow probe and the time to occlusion (TTO) was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The carotid artery occluded within 60 minutes of injury in 72 of the animals studied (97.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The carotid artery remained patent at 60 minutes in the remaining two animals, both of whom were subsequently found to be genotypically <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant relationship between TTO and genotype (p = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TTO was greatest in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice (p &lt; .001 vs heterozygous, &lt; .001 vs homozygous) and least in the homozygotes (p &lt; .001 vs heterozygotes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Increased thrombogenicity is present in mice with the FVL mutation and is more prolonged in homozygotes than heterozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings provide some corroboration to the clinical studies that suggest an increased risk of arterial events in patients with the FVL mutation </plain></SENT>
