<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study compares the efficacy of two formulations of encapsulated streptokinase to streptokinase in a rabbit model of carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>Arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> followed the injection of thrombin mixed with autologous whole blood into a carotid artery of New Zealand white rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes after the confirmation of an occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, one of four streptokinase formulations was infused at a dosage of 6000 IU/kg into the jugular vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Free streptokinase (FREE SK) was compared to identical dosages of streptokinase encapsulated in a liposome (LESK), streptokinase entrapped in a water-soluble polymer (MESK), and free streptokinase admixed with blank microparticles (FREE SK + BLANK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Carotid arterial blood flow was determined by pulsed Doppler flowmetry to confirm clot formation and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two hours after drug infusion, the rabbits were killed and the residual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> mass was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to FREE SK (74.5 +/- 16.9 min; mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>), LESK demonstrated significantly reduced reperfusion times (19.3 +/- 4.6 min) while MESK exhibited even greater improvement (7.3 +/- 1.6 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FREE SK + BLANK showed no statistical improvement versus FREE SK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LESK and MESK also resulted in reduced residual clot mass and greater return of arterial blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that encapsulation of streptokinase offers a potential method of improved fibrinolytic treatment for patients with clot-based disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MESK performed slightly better than LESK with improved production and storage characteristics </plain></SENT>
