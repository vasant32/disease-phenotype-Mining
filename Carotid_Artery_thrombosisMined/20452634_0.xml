<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Since 2003, intravenous thrombolysis with rt-PA for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> victims has been largely developed in the military hospital of Toulon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the results of our practice and compare them with the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>WeÂ also sought to identify predictive factors of favorable outcome after thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients treated with rt-PA for a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the carotid territory between September 2003 and June 2009 were prospectively included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disability was assessed at 3 months with the modified Rankin Scale (m-RS); outcome was considered unfavorable if m-RS score was above 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis was then performed to identify parameters correlating with poor and favorable outcome at 3 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and one patients were included in this study (mean initial National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale [NIHSS]: 15.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>53.4% had a Rankin score higher than 2 at 3 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, low NIHSS score on admission, short time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to treatment, and prior <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use were identified as independent predictive factors of favorable functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After 6 years of activity, our <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit has results that appear similar to those of the French and international trials in terms of safety and efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Efficacy of rt-PA in our series is poor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> caused by large-vessel atherothrombotic changes and cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissection</z:e> due to high incidence of internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our studies also suggest that prior <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use may be an independent predictive factor of favorable outcome after thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
