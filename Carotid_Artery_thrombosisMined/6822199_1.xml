<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conventional carotid angiography was performed in 156 cases, 363 were examined by digital subtraction angiography (DSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three methods were employed for 32 carotid systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was demonstrated that the accuracy of the Doppler-echo flow method depends on the experience of the examiner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the hands of the experienced, accurate diagnosis with regard to "haemodynamic effective obstruction" was 96% and for "no haemodynamically effective obstruction" 98% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among beginners the corresponding results were 87 and 93%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DAS was a very low-risk procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Directly occurring cerebrovascular complications during manipulation were not observed among 1,000 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results agreed in 88% of cases examined by the Doppler-echo flow method, so that in most cases it is possible to avoid arterial angiography with its higher risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of 32 cases, in which there was additional arterial angiography, indicates that there may be some false-positive and false-negative results with DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If the findings do not agree, arterial angiography is still necessary </plain></SENT>
