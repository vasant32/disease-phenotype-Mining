<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purpose of this report is to describe the clinical and pathologic features of a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of both internal carotid arteries leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a case report of special interest because of extensive brain vessel pathologic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The analysis of this case showed that the brain had suffered massive infarction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The internal carotid arteries (ICAs) were occluded by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The arterial wall of the left ICA, studied at its distal segment, showed a small amount of intimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> which did not cause encroachment on the lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical stains indicated that this lesion was formed by proliferative vascular smooth muscle rather than incremental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation can occur in the large cerebral arteries of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> in the presence of only minimal intimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The intimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> which forms the sickle related vasculopathy seen on angiography or detected by Transcranial Doppler may be more related to stimulation of smooth muscle cells than dysregulation of thromboregulation at the endothelial surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Implications for preventive treatment are discussed </plain></SENT>
