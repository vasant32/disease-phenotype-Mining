<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These were noncrimped <z:chebi fb="80" ids="53550">polypropylene</z:chebi>-supported filamentous velour knitted Dacron (PPSFV) and expanded <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> (e-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi>, Gore-Tex) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One series of implants was subjected to controlled low flow rates for six hours; another was exposed to physiologic flow rates and observed at seven days, 14 days, and 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At six hours the filamentous Dacron, preclotted according to a specific regimen utilizating <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, performed as well as, and possibly better than, e-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Gore-Tex developed surface coagulum in an irregular fashion which was related to graft wetting and blood soakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven-day TFS scores and patency rates of the two graft types were comparable at physiologic flow rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At two weeks, TFS scores and patency rates of the two graft types were comparable at physiologic flow rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At two weeks, TFS scores and patency rates dropped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was sufficiently marked in the case of e-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi> that longer-term implants were not done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, PPSFV grafts were implanted for 12 weeks, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> grafts examined at that time had closed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It appears that patency of 4 mm ID grafts of this construction will not be reliably attained in the dog carotid artery without the use of platelet-inhibitory drugs until complete healing has occurred </plain></SENT>
