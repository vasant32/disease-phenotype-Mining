<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The substrate recognition region of tissue factor contains two residues, Lys165 and Lys166, which are important for macromolecular substrate activation by the tissue factor:factor VIIa complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Replacement of these two residues with alanine in a soluble version of human tissue factor resulted in a mutant, hTFAA, which can bind factor VIIa but forms an enzymatically inactive complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that hTFAA inhibits the activity of guinea pig factor VIIa, allowing us to evaluate hTFAA's effects on <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and hemostasis in a guinea pig model of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, the effects of hTFAA were compared to active site inhibited factor IXa (F.IXai) and factor Xa (F.Xai) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that hTFAA, F.IXai and F.Xai were potent antithrombotics and may possess a decreased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> when compared to unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When administered at a dose that inhibited <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> by about 90%, hTFAA neither affected cuticle <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> nor the activated partial thromboplastin time, and had only a modest effect on the prothrombin time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At equi-efficacious doses, F.IXai, F.Xai and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003010'>prolonged bleeding times</z:hpo> by 20% (p &gt;0.5), 50% (p &lt;0.05) and 100% (p &lt;0.01), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, our study demonstrates that, unlike <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, specific inhibitors of factors VIIa, IXa and Xa can produce antithrombotic effects without or with only minimally disturbing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hemostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results further suggest that factor VIIa and factor IXa are especially promising targets for antithrombotic drug development </plain></SENT>
