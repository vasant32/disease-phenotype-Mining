<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of our study was determine the results of CEA in the octogenarians patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1998 and May 2008, 755 CEAs were performed by the first author </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 73 (9.7%) were performed in 69 octogenarians (40 men, 29 women) with a median age of 83 years (range, 80 to 90 years ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before the procedures, 46 patients (63%) were asymptomatic and 27 (37%) had a severe (&gt;70%) asymptomatic stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> (68.1%), tobacco history (47.8%) and ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopathy</z:e> (39.1%) were the most prevalent comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgical data and perioperative results such as ocurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, transitory ischemic atacks, need for re-operation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as a long term survival estimate by Kaplan Meier method were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 73 operations, there was two early (&lt;30 days( postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (2.7%) due to pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> in a patient submitted to myocardial revascularization simultaneously and due to a fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in another patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was one non-fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (1.4%) due to early (eighth post-operative day) carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>; and one non-fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (1.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Another four patients (5.5%) were submitted to early reoperation due to neck <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of patients that have been discharged (n=67), late information was available in 55 patients (82.1%) and the Kaplan-Meier estimated 5-year survival rate was 60.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that CEA may be performed in selected octogenarians patients to treat carotid occlusive disease with good results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, age alone should not be considered as a prohibitive risk factor for patients candidates for CEA </plain></SENT>
