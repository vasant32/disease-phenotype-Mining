<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The procoagulant effect of anionic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> may play a major role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Annexin V, a calcium-dependent anionic-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding protein, was expressed and isolated from Escherichia coli and its antithrombotic effect examined in a rabbit carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A partially occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was formed in the left carotid artery by application of electric current to produce an approximately 50% occlusion of the lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the current was discontinued, flow ceased completely within 42+/-12 minutes (n=6) because of continuing platelet/fibrin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When annexin V was given at doses of 2.8 to 16.6 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) for a period of 180 minutes, starting at the time the current was stopped, there was a dose-dependent inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At a dose of 5.6 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1), blood flow remained patent throughout the infusion and for an additional 60 minutes after the infusion was stopped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was a decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> weight (16+/-7.4 versus 2.0+/-1.0 g), (125)I-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>fibrin deposition</z:mpath> (approximately 45% reduction, P&lt;.001), and (111)In-labeled platelet accumulation (approximately 43% reduction, P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prior mixing of annexin V with phosphatidylserine micelles abolished the antithrombotic effect of annexin V, whereas mixing with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> micelles had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The antithrombotic effect of annexin V was not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001892'>bleeding tendency</z:hpo>, as judged by the amount of blood absorbed in a gauze pad placed in a surgical incision extending to the muscle tissue and by the standard template <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These observations support a potentially important role for anionic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> exposure in platelets in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, and inhibition of this activity could be a novel target for therapy in coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and after angioplasty </plain></SENT>
