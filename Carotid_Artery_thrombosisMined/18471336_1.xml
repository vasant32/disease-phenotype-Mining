<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Blood oxygen concentration decrease may be associated with haemostatic impairments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to study the effect of oxygen decrease in a rabbit model of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 44 rabbits were anaesthetized, ventilated and monitored for blood pressure, blood arterial gas, temperature and carotid blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Folts model was used: a stenosis (75%) and an injury were carried out on the carotid artery, inducing <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood flow decreased as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> size increased until the pressure gradient was such that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was released and local arterial blood flow was suddenly restored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is known as a cyclic flow reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After counting baseline cyclic flow reductions during a 20-min period (P1), rabbits were randomized blindly to one of three groups: hyperoxic, FiO2=100%; normoxic, FiO2 was decreased to obtain a PaO2 between 80 and 120 mmHg; hypoxic, PaO2 &lt; 80 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Then CFRs were recorded over a second 20-min period (P2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the end of the experiment, a hepatosplenic section was done and the amount of blood loss was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After each period, the following parameters were measured: blood gas, ear-immersion <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time, <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi>, platelet count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and fibrinogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Oxygen decrease during hypoxic and normoxic periods was associated with a decrease in cyclic flow reductions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Bleeding</z:mp> time increased in the hypoxic group unless hepatosplenic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> remained stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A slight increase in activated partial thromboplastin time was observed in the normoxic and hypoxic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An abrupt decrease in oxygen administration was responsible for an antithrombotic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Increase in <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time occurred during <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No clinically relevant variation of any haemostasis parameters was observed </plain></SENT>
