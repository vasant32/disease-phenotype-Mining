<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>SAK-RGD-K2-Hir and SAK-RGD-K2-Hirul are recombinant proteins that are derivatives of r-SAK (recombinant staphylokinase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are characterized by their fibrin-specific plasminogen activation properties and their antithrombin and antiplatelet activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The difference between these proteins is the presence of the antithrombotic fragment (hirudin or hirulog) in the C-terminal portion of the r-SAK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to examine the thrombolytic potentials of SAK-RGD-K2-Hir and SAK-RGD-K2-Hirul in an electrically induced carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model in rats and to compare the potentials to that of r-SAK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We determined that a bolus injection of SAK-RGD-K2-Hirul was more effective than one of r-SAK in the improvement and maintenance of carotid patency and in arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> weight reduction; however, it had the same potency as SAK-RGD-K2-Hir </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were significantly prolonged in the animals that were treated with either dose (1.5 or 3.0 mg/kg) of SAK-RGD-K2-Hir or SAK-RGD-K2-Hirul, whereas no changes were observed in the plasma fibrinogen concentration or the Î±2 plasmin inhibitor level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>r-SAK alone did not change the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time or coagulation parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our findings demonstrate the thrombolytic activity of intravenous bolus injection of the novel thrombolytic agent SAK-RGD-K2-Hirul in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although this protein compares favorably with r-SAK, we were unable to show the presence of any beneficial effects of SAK-RGD-K2-Hirul over those of SAK-RGD-K2-Hir </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our results suggest that high doses of SAK-RGD-K2-Hirul bear the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
