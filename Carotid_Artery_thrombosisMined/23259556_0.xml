<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SIRT1 deacetylates <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> and non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> proteins and has been implicated in protective effects of caloric restriction on lifespan and metabolic pathways in yeast, nematodes, and mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the vasculature of rodents, SIRT1 mediates vasodilatation through the release of endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase-derived nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and scavenges reactive oxygen species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a genetic loss-of-function approach, SIRT1 has been shown to interfere with crucial steps of endothelial activation and atherogenesis by suppressing NFÎºB signaling: Partial SIRT1 deletion in ApoE-/- mice prevented expression of endothelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules thereby hampering the extravasation of circulating monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In monocyte-derived macrophages SIRT1 deletion reduced the expression of the scavenger receptor lectin-like oxidized <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> receptor 1 (Lox-1) resulting in reduced foam cell formation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it was reported that SIRT1 regulates the activity of liver X-receptor, thereby promoting ABCA1-driven reverse cholesterol transport in plaque-resident macrophages slowing foam cell formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, SIRT1 suppressed the expression of endothelial tissue factor, and thus exerted anti-thrombotic properties during induced carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate protective effects of SIRT1 in atherogenesis and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> at an experimental level and highlight the opportunity to translate this concept from bench to bedside </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Indeed, SIRT1 activators are available and have been shown to exert beneficial effects at the preclinical level in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SIRT1 activators are currently being evaluated in phase II clinical trials in patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The concept of SIRT1 activation appears a promising strategy for novel therapeutic approaches in patients with atherothrombosis </plain></SENT>
