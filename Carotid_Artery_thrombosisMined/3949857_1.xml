<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Changes associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were loss of frequency and amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results of CEM were correlated with carotid stump pressure (CSP) measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only one (4%) of the 25 patients who developed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>abnormal EEG</z:hpo> had a mean CSP greater than 50 mmHg: however, CEM was positive in only 24 (45%) of the 53 patients with a CSP less than 50 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using EEG as a standard, no CSP criterion (50 or 25 mmHg) was sufficiently sensitive and specific to recommend its routine use (50 mmHg--96% and 61% respectively; 25 mmHg--40% and 96% respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Operative mortality was 1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The three intraoperative neurologic deficits (3%), one transient and two permanent, are analyzed with respect to the operative EEG findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 100 endarterectomy patients and three more undergoing carotid exploration or excision of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_400'>carotid body tumor</z:mpath> EEG changes due to <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> problems not associated with carotid clamping were often identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 48 additional endarterectomies a computerized display and disk storage of six selected EEG leads, each with a reference trace for comparison, has provided information equivalent to that from the full EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EEG monitoring is more accurate than CSP measurement for identifying patients who require shunting, safely dispensing with a shunt in many cases which would otherwise be shunted by standard CSP criteria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
