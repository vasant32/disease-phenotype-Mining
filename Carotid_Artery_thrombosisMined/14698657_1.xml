<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated if elevation of endogenous plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) can retard thrombolysis in both a rat model of lung vasculature <z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>fibrin deposition</z:mpath> and a platelet-rich <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> model induced by endothelial injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By 3 h following an intravenous bolus injection of 0.5 mg/kg LPS, the plasma PAI-1 level had increased to approximately 8 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>125I-labeled fibrinogen was injected intravenously followed by an injection of batroxobin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Batroxobin converts fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin, which was then deposited in the lungs within 5 min, followed by spontaneous fibrinolysis that completely cleared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>fibrin deposition</z:mpath> in the lungs by 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In rats pre-treated with LPS, spontaneous fibrinolysis was significantly retarded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the endothelial injury model, topical application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30812">FeCl2</z:chebi> on the carotid artery induced an occlusive platelet-rich <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, which was not sensitive to endogenous thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exogenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) was required to recanalize the occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pre-treatment with LPS did not alter the dose-response curve of exogenous tPA-induced thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that batroxobin-induced lung vasculature <z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>fibrin deposition</z:mpath> in rats, unlike the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30812">FeCl2</z:chebi> model, is sensitive to the impact of endogenous PAI-1 on fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
