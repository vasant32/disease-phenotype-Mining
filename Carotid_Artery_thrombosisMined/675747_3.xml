<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The occluded internal carotid arteries of 2 patients were confirmed angiographically to recanalize and the reversed flow of their ophthalmic arteries changed to physiological flow after the recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ophthalmic artery blood flow remained reversed in 2 patients whose occluded internal carotid arteries did not recanalize on the follow up angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the other patient, whose ophthalmic artery blood flow was not detected by the ultrasonic Doppler flowmeter in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage, physiological flow through the ophthalmic artery was detected later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The occluded internal carotid artery did not recanalize and this physiological ophthalmic artery blood flow was filled through the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
