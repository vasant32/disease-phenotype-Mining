<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was found that in 24 patients with serious state changes prevailed involving nearly the whole lobe in CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> CT demonstrated major lesions with involvement of a whole lobe as well as small deep lesions and cortical foci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 27 patients the first CT examination demonstrated extensive lesions involving a whole lobe or a hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this group clinical manifestations regressed completely in 3 cases within 10 days, in 15 cases an improvement was observed, 3 cases failed to improve and 6 patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 12 cases with small cortical lesions regression of clinical manifestations was observed in 3 patients, 8 patients improved and one failed to improve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations showed a certain correlation between the clinical state and CT findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prognostic conclusions could be reached, however, only if a correlation existed between the clinical picture and CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In case of lack of agreement, that is if extensive lesions coexisted with slight clinical changes or small lesions with a serious condition the clinical picture was of greater prognostic significance than CT findings </plain></SENT>
