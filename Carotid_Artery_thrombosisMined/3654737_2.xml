<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This test of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> function measures the recovery time of the amplitude of the major positive peak (P100) after photostress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When compared to that we observed in controls, we found, a significant increase of the P100 recovery time in patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> with severe stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The method proved suitable for the functional evaluation of the vascular reconstruction of the carotid area, since four weeks after surgery a physiological recovery of the amplitude of VEP was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This method is proposed by the authors for the long-term functional evaluation of patients subjected to carotid thromboendarterectomy for tight stenosis of the carotid bifurcation </plain></SENT>
