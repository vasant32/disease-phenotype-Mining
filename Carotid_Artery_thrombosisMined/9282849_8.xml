<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess in a swine model the in vivo thrombogenicity of various microcatheters and guiding catheters as a function of catheter material, catheter coating, and duration of implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Microcatheters (Tracker 18 and Fastracker 18, Target Therapeutics, Fremont, Calif; Magic 1.8, Balt, Montmorency, France; and Transit, Cordis Endovascular Systems, Miami Lakes, Fla) were placed through 6F guiding catheters (Fasguide, Target Therapeutics, and Envoy, Cordis Endovascular Systems) into the common carotid arteries of swine for 30 minutes (short term), 90 minutes (medium term), and 35 days (long term) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Guiding catheters were implanted for 5 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the end of the implantation periods the catheters were retracted and fixed for scanning electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The surface of the Fastracker microcatheter was devoid of debris after both short- and medium-term implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Tracker microcatheter had minimal accumulation of cellular elements whereas the Transit microcatheter showed moderate accumulation of nondeformed red blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither the Tracker nor the Transit microcatheter showed evidence of increasing debris accumulation after medium-term implantation as compared with short-term implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Magic microcatheter was coated with gross <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> after both short- and medium-term implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Fasguide guiding catheter was nearly devoid of debris, while the Envoy guiding catheter had moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Long-term implantation of the Fastracker microcatheter was well tolerated whereas that of the Transit catheter resulted in vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hydrophilic microcatheters and guiding catheters are less thrombogenic than their nonhydrophilic counterparts, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hydrophilic coatings are equally hypothrombogenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Degree of thrombogenicity depends on catheter material rather than surface <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Medium-term implantation did not yield increasing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation relative to short-term implantation </plain></SENT>
