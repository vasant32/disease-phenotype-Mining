<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This article describes the equivalent antiplatelet/antithrombotic effects of DMP755 at comparable doses by intranasal and i.v. administration but required substantially higher doses with the oral administration route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antiplatelet and antithrombotic efficacy of DMP755 or its free acid form XV459 were determined in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>Arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> models were induced either electrolytically (200 microA anodal current) in the carotid artery or mechanically by external clamping of femoral artery along with stenosis, which result in either total occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation or cyclic flow reduction (CFR), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Either DMP755 or its free acid form, XV459 demonstrated maximal and comparable antiplatelet efficacy at 0.025-0.1 mg/kg, intravenous (i.v.) or intranasal but not oral (PO) in mongrel dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The antiplatelet efficacy of DMP755 at 0.1 mg/kg, intranasal, or i.v. was determined in a cross-over design (n=8 in each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, a comparable and maximal antiplatelet efficacy for DMP755 after intranasal or i.v. was demonstrated suggesting 100% intranasal bioavailability as compared with the modest antiplatelet efficacy at 0.1 mg/kg, p.o </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DMP755 administered at 0.1 mg/kg, intranasally or i.v. or at 0.3 mg/kg, p.o. prevented the incidence of electrolytic injury-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in the carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model and prevented the incidence of cyclic flow reduction in mechanically injured and stenosed femoral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, DMP755 has a comparable intranasal and intravenous antiplatelet/antithrombotic profiles along with a significant improvement over its oral profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data also suggest the potential utility of intranasal DMP755 in various <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> thromboembolic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of intranasal bioavailability of a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
