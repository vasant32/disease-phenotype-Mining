<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1992 and 2001, 49 patients had radiosurgery for dural-based masses of the cavernous sinus presumed to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean patient age was 55.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume was 10.2 mL; the mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> margin dose was 15.9 Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 58 months (range, 16-144 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> enlarged after radiosurgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve of 38 patients (26%) with preexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> or facial numbness/pain had improvement in cranial nerve function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients (10%) had new (n = 3) or worsened (n = 2) trigeminal dysfunction; 2 of these patients (4%) underwent surgery at 20 and 25 months after radiosurgery despite no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither patient improved after partial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient (2%) developed an oculomotor nerve injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient (2%) had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> related to occlusion of the cavernous segment of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Event-free survival was 98%, 85%, and 80% at 1, 3, and 7 years after radiosurgery, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis of patient and dosimetric factors found no analyzed factor correlated with postradiosurgical morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery was an effective primary management strategy for patients with an imaging defined cavernous sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Except in situations of symptomatic mass effect, unusual clinical presentation, or atypical imaging features, surgery to confirm the histologic diagnosis is unlikely to provide clinical benefit </plain></SENT>
