<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood clots were produced in cellulose dialysis tubing and then placed into appropriate baths of either saline or water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The echogenicity changes were then followed quantitatively using A-mode and qualitatively using B-mode imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood clots in saline showed an initial decrease followed by a leveling off in echogenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood clots in water showed a decline in echogenicity throughout the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The A-mode imaging was effectively able to follow blood clot echogenicity changes under these controlled conditions </plain></SENT>
