<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A study was carried out on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> after carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A specific type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, similar in its characteristics to "cluster <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>", occurred on the operative side in 30% of 54 patients, whereas no such <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> occurred after extra-intracranial bypass or peripheral vascular surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was not spontaneously reported by 56% of patients unless they were specifically asked about it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological pupillary testing performed in 37 patients revealed that a decreased oculosympathetic activity (with or without adrenoceptor supersensitivity) was constantly associated with post-endarterectomy <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although this same abnormality was also observed in 54% of the patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, a statistically significant (p less than 0.01) higher prevalence of decreased oculosympathetic responses was found in the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that damage to the sympathetic plexus due to the surgical procedure is involved in the development of postoperative "cluster-like" <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
