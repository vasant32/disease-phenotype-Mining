<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to fabricate a compliant engineered vascular graft (inner diameter of approximately 4.5 mm and length of 6 cm) lined with endothelial progenitor cells derived from circulating peripheral canine blood and to verify its nonthrombogenicity potential in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Autologous circulating endothelial progenitor cells derived from the peripheral veins of 6 adult mongrel dogs were isolated by using a density gradient method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cells were proliferated in vitro in EGM-2 culture medium, prelined on the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surface of in situ-formed collagen type I meshes as an extracellular matrix, and wrapped with a segmented <z:chebi fb="82" ids="53284">polyurethane</z:chebi> thin film with multiple micropores as a compliant scaffold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After canine carotid arteries were bilaterally implanted with these grafts for 1 and 3 months, microscopic observation, histologic staining, and immunochemical staining were performed to evaluate morphogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 33.3 +/- 10.5 days of culture in vitro, 4.2 +/- 1.2 x 10(6) endothelial progenitor cells were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the 12 engineered vascular grafts were patent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The grafts possessed smooth, glistening, and ivory-colored <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surfaces at the predetermined observation period up to 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The intimal layer was covered with confluent, cobblestone-like monolayered cells that were positively stained with factor VIIIB-related antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The thickness of the neoarterial walls was approximately 300 microm at 3 months after implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A few smooth muscle cells were observed in the medial tissue, and fibroblasts dominated the adventitial tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Circulating endothelial progenitor cells could be a substitute source of endothelial cells for endothelialization on small-diameter-vessel prostheses to ensure nonthrombogenicity </plain></SENT>
