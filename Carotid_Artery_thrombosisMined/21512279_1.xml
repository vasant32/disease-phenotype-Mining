<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Obovatol, a major biphenolic component of Magnolia Obovata leaves, displays anti-inflammatory and acyl Co-A cholesterol acyltrasferase inhibitory effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of obovatol on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in vivo and platelet activation in vitro and ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated the antiplatelet and antithrombotic activities of obovatol in rat carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in vivo along with platelet aggregation in vitro and ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Its possible cellular mechanism of antiplatelet activity was investigated by testing PLC-γ2 activation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> cascade, calcium mobilization and granule secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Oral administration of obovatol prevented carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, but also significantly inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Obovatol did not change coagulation times, such as activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time, indicating that the antithrombotic effect of obovatol might be due to antiplatelet activity rather than anticoagulation activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Obovatol inhibited in vitro collagen- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi>-induced rabbit platelet aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner (1-10 µM), with IC(50) values of 2.4 ± 0.8 and 4.8 ± 0.9 µM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Obovatol blocked collagen-mediated phospholipase C-γ2 phosphorylation, cytoplasmic calcium mobilization, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> liberation and <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Obovatol has a potent antithrombotic effect, which may be due to antiplatelet activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The antiplatelet activity of obovatol is mediated by inhibition of PLC-γ2 phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, obovatol may be a potential candidate to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
