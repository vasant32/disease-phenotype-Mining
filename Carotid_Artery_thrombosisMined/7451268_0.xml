<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our patient, a 49-year old woman, developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the internal carotid artery two days following transoral removal of an elongated styloid process through the tonsillar fossa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis, diagnosis and therapy of posttraumatic carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> are discussed, inclusive of surgical trauma </plain></SENT>
