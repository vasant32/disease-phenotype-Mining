<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We further sought to determine whether the antithrombotic efficacy in vivo could be predicted using an ex-vivo perfusion chamber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oral treatments included: PD0348292 (0.4, 0.9, or 4.3 mg/kg); PD0348292 (0.4 mg/kg) plus aspirin (325 mg); aspirin; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> (75 mg); aspirin plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi>; or vehicle (n = 6-10/group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aspirin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> were administered 27 and four hours pre-injury and PD0348292 or vehicle was administered four hours pre-injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both carotid arteries were crush-injured, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was measured by detection of (111)In-platelets over 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prior to injury, the antithrombotic efficacy was assessed by ex-vivo perfusion chamber platelet deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PD0348292 produced dose-dependent prothrombin time (0.9- to 2.9-fold) and aPTT (1.4- to 2.5-fold) prolongations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Bleeding</z:mp> times were significantly prolonged in each active drug group compared to vehicle, but were not significantly different between drug groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PD0348292 significantly inhibited arterial platelet deposition (x10(6)/cm(2)) at 4.3(549 +/- 1,066), 0.9 (399 +/- 162) and 0.4 mg/kg (531 +/- 470) compared to vehicle (2,242 +/- 1,443) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aspirin (992 +/- 973), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> (537 +/- 483), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> plus aspirin (228 +/- 66) or PD0348292 plus aspirin (558 +/- 317) also significantly inhibited platelet deposition, although these values were not significantly different than with any dose of PD348292 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Perfusion chamber platelet deposition correlated significantly with in-vivo anti-thrombotic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, PD0348292 inhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> comparable to aspirin plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Perfusion chamber methodology may be useful in predicting in-vivo antithrombotic efficacy </plain></SENT>
