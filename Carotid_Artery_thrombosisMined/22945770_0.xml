<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A combination of low-dose aspirin (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50218">phosphodiesterase inhibitor</z:chebi> has been clinically tried for the secondary prevention of atherothrombotic diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The in vivo antithrombotic property of ibudilast (CAS 50847-11-5), a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor, was evaluated in a photochemically-induced guinea pig carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model in combination with low-dose <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The time required to decrease the carotid artery blood flow to the reading "zero" was defined as the time to occlusion (TTO) of the artery through thrombogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each independent use of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> (300 mg/kg, p.o.) and ibudilast (3 and 10 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly prolonged the TTO, and <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> (300 mg/kg) significantly <z:hpo ids='HP_0003010'>increased bleeding time</z:hpo> (BT) and gastric mucosal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A selective PDE4 inhibitor rolipram (1 and 5 mg/kg, p.o.) tended to prolong the TTO without extending BT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> (100 mg/kg) plus ibudilast (3 mg/kg) and <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> (100 mg/kg) plus rolipram (5 mg/kg) markedly prolonged the TTO compared with each agent alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> (100 mg/kg) plus ibudilast (3 mg/kg) caused a longer TTO than <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> (300 mg/kg) alone, without significant extension of BT and gastric mucosal injury as observed in <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> (300 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the combination of low-dose <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> and ibudilast has a more potent antithrombotic effect than <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> alone without increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001892'>bleeding tendency</z:hpo> and gastric mucosal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The potent in vivo antithrombotic effect of this combination may be brought about by an action that is associated with PDE4 inhibition of ibudilast </plain></SENT>
