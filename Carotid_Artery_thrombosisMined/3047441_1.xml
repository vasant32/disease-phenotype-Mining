<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of DS was established at greater than 90% by blinded comparison with angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the study period 138 patients (68%) had stable carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and 65 patients (32%) had progression of stenosis in at least one artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients had new symptoms of cerebrovascular disease (19 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> and 11 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was not possible to predict which patients would become symptomatic on the basis of risk factor analysis or analysis of severity of stable <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with progression of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> to greater than 50% diameter reduction were significantly more likely (p less than 0.0001) to have new <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than were those with stable carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, regardless of severity </plain></SENT>
