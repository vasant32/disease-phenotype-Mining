<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To model <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> in rats, photochemically induced nonocclusive common carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CCAT) was used to generate a platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the carotid artery of anesthetized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After CCAT, platelet aggregates break off the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, travel to the distal cerebral vasculature, damage blood vessels, and cause small infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors hypothesized that deficits in the endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS) pathway may be responsible for vascular dysfunction after embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To examine the functional status of the eNOS system, they measured eNOS-dependent dilation after CCAT by applying <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> through a cranial window over the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors also measured eNOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein in the middle cerebral artery to determine whether functional changes were caused by alterations in expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>eNOS-dependent dilation was reduced at 6 hours, elevated at 24 hours, and returned to baseline 72 hours after CCAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> increased at 2 hours and was followed by a rise in protein 24 hours after CCAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Changes in the eNOS system may account for some of the observed vascular deficits in patients with cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
