<SENT sid="1" pm="?"><plain>OBJECTIVES: Is 3 h of routine monitoring as effective as 6 h in the prevention of early postoperative thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, consecutive study in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with an accessible cranial window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and sixty-six patients undergoing CEA underwent 3 h of postoperative monitoring by TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Any patient with &gt; 25 emboli detected in any 10 min period or those with emboli that distorted the arterial waveform were commenced on an incremental infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran 40</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The majority of patients destined to embolise will do so within the first 2 postoperative hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran</z:chebi> therapy was instituted in nine patients (5%) and rapidly controlled this phase of embolisation although the dose had to be increased in three (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patient suffered a postoperative carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> but one suffered a minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on day 5 and was found to have profuse embolisation on TCD; high dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> therapy was again instituted, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> count rate fell rapidly and he made a good recovery thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was 1.2% and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was 2.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Three hours of postoperative TCD monitoring is as effective as 6 h in the prevention of postoperative carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
