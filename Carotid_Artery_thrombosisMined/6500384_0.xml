<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> had antithrombotic activity, but only at high doses (200 mg/kg), when carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was induced 15 min after intravenous drug administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lower doses were associated with augmented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in some animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2-Propionyloxybenzoic acid, which has in vitro activities similar to <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>, caused similar in vivo effects, but was antithrombotic at 100 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>3-Propionyloxybenzoic acid, which augments platelet function in vitro, and 3-methylphthalide, which inhibits biphasic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi>-induced platelet aggregation, had no statistically significant effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2-Acetoxybenzoic acid, which is a weak platelet aggregation and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> biosynthesis inhibitor, had antithrombotic activity at 100 and 200 mg/kg and was not associated with augmented <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> at lower doses as found with <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pattern of antithrombotic activity of this series of compounds does not reflect in vitro effects on <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> biosynthesis and indicates alternative mechanisms of antithrombotic activity </plain></SENT>
