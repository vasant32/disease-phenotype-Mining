<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two types of lesions are considered: occlusion and very tight stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The principle of early surgery in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusion is very controverse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to the facts reported (38 cases) results are rewarding when operative decision is taken under precise conditions judged as favorable: short lapse of time since occlusive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, absence of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> state and no sign of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain oedema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some patients under go surgery in the priviledged condition of being already in a medico-surgical unit (post operative, post angiographic, embolic occlusions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Majority present the most common hemiplegic attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However difficulty resides in the inefficient mode of transport to hospital and lack of highly specialized units on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A very tight stenosis (at extreme a pseudo-occlusive stenosis) with clinical recurrent deficit, modified Loppler's recording and hemodynamic repercussion at angiography is an operative emergency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When results of early surgery on 38 cases of stenosis are compared to those of late operation in 14 similar cases early decision becomes compulsory once tight stenosis of the carotid artery is identified and operative criteria respected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the light of this report that "wait and see attitude" needs be somewhat revised when confronted to the dramatic ictal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
