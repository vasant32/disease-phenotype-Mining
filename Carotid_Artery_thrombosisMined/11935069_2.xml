<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transient distal platelet accumulation after common carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CCAT) leads to hemodynamic, metabolic, and molecular events that may influence the response of the postthromboembolic brain to secondary emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of repeated embolic episodes on histopathological outcome at various time intervals using a clinically relevant model of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six groups of rats underwent either photochemically induced CCAT followed by sham surgery or 2 episodes of CCAT separated by 10 minutes or 1, 3, 5, or 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures included routine histopathological analysis and determination of the number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> loci and their total volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rats that underwent a second CCAT at 1, 3, or 5 days after the first insult had 20 to 30 times larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes than rats in the single-CCAT group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, rats in the 10-minute and 1-, 3-, and 5-day groups had 2 to 3 times as many <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> as those in the single-CCAT group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> produced by double insults commonly extended through the neuraxis and were necrotic, edematous, and sometimes hemorrhagic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A prior thromboembolic event puts the brain at risk for severe infarction after a second embolic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings cannot be explained solely by a greater number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Elucidating pathomechanisms responsible for the vulnerability of the postthromboembolic brain may provide targets for new treatment strategies to prevent the severe consequences of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
