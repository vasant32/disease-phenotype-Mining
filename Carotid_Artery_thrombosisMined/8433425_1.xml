<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Because the platelet membrane receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa plays a central role in the recruitment of platelets into forming <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, therapeutic inhibition of this receptor complex may be particularly useful to prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> after small vessel arterial manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The relative hemostatic safety and antithrombotic efficacy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation at sites of endarterectomy and implanted prosthetic vascular graft of a murine monoclonal antibody (LJ-CP8) against platelet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa have been determined in baboons after bolus injections in doses (10 mg/kg) that block platelet receptor function for fibrinogen and other adhesive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> (absent platelet aggregation and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> times &gt; 30 minutes without affecting circulating platelet counts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Thrombus</z:e> formation was eliminated by LJ-CP8 at sites of surgical endarterectomy in fresh segments of homologous aorta incorporated into <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> exteriorized arteriovenous femoral shunts (accumulation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">indium</z:chebi> 111-labeled platelets fell from 4.40 +/- 0.89 x 10(9) platelets/cm in control animals [n = 6] to 0.23 +/- 0.01 x 10(9) platelets/cm in treated animals [n = 4]; p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The formation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was also abolished by LJ-CP8 at sites of 1 cm prosthetic vascular grafts (4 mm inner diameter <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> grafts) interposed into common carotid arteries (deposition of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">indium</z:chebi> 111-labeled platelets decreased from 2.57 +/- 0.43 x 10(9) platelets/cm [n = 5] to 0.16 +/- 0.06 x 10(9) platelets/cm, [n = 4]; p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, LJ-CP8 injections produced substantial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in the surgical wound during the first few hours after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty days after operation <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four graft implants were patent in JJ-CP8-treated animals compared with two of five in control animals (p = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that profound inhibition of platelet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa receptor function by single bolus injection of LJ-CP8 monoclonal antibody transiently abolishes platelet hemostatic function, eliminates <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation at sites of endarterectomy and prosthetic vascular graft implants, and may improve vascular patency </plain></SENT>
