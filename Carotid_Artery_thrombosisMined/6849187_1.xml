<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A significant EEG change, 40% power attentuation in <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi>-induced fast activity, was documented with a tracing record, compressed spectral analysis, and PSA-1 in this series of 195 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interpretation of the change was simplified by the use of the compressed spectral analysis or PSA-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quantification of the change was aided by use of the PSA-1, and the graphic output form of this instrument minimized user error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also, it provided the needed information to those members of the operative team not skilled in EEG interpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No immediate postoperative deficits were missed by the monitoring technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no postoperative deficits upon awakening in the 138 patients without processed EEG change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Shunt placement, depth of anesthesia, and intraoperative blood pressure levels were accurately guided throughout the operative procedure by these monitoring techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Accurate documentation of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> significant change permits prompt treatment for restoration of necessary collateral flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The monitoring technique described continuously provides information for efficacy of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Attention to blood pressure level, which seems to passively determine cerebral collateral flow during clamping, was a very important clinically manipulable variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Manipulation of this variable with processed EEG control may prove efficacious not only in patients undergoing carotid procedures but in nonsurgical cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> carotid occlusion or middle cerebral stem occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Manipulation of identifiable critical variables has a positive impact on the clinical outcome when continuous monitoring is employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The detection of hemispheric low flow in 34 patients during the preclamp, clamp, and postclamp periods suggests that shunting will not prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> low flow deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Finally, perfection of surgical therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention necessitates detection and treatment of hemispheric low flow </plain></SENT>
