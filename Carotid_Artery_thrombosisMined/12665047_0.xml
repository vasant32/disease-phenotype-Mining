<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of early thrombolytic therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is to obtain early recanalization of occluded cerebral arteries and prevent or reduce irreversible ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, Seldinger technique and digital subtraction angiography were used to verify thromboembolic occlusion of the common carotid artery by an autologous 12-hour-old <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in 28 rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes after embolization, 2 mg/kg of recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was delivered intravenously by way of the femoral vein in group A (n = 8) and through a local intraarterial infusion in group B (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve control animals received an equivalent volume of saline intravenously (group C, n = 6) or by local intra-arterial infusion (group D, n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A comparison of posttreatment angiographs of the treatment groups and the control groups was used to demonstrate reperfusion induced by thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the control animals showed any evidence of recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both intravenously (group A) and intra-arterially (group B) treated animals achieved 100% recanalization, although the average time to recanalization was significantly longer in group A (P = .01; 123.7 vs 82.5 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that local intra-arterial administration of rt-PA within 30 minutes produces more rapid reperfusion compared with the intravenous route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies and additional treatments are needed to widen the therapeutic window and decrease hemorrhagic side effects </plain></SENT>
