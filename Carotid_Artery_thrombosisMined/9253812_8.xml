<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed spectral analysis of echo signals acquired from human carotid endarterectomy specimens in vitro to calculate three parameters of the calibrated power spectrum: slope, intercept and total power for fibrous, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> pool and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> constituents of plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plaque constituents were identified histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated classification efficacy by discriminant function analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Slope and intercept parameters alone provided correct classification in 92.5%, 57.6% and 72.4% of fibrous, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> pool and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> plaque components, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Slope, intercept and total power used in combination improved classification of the three tissue types to 93.0%, 69.7% and 81.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall proportion of correctly classified tissue regions increased from 84.5% to 88.0% by the combined use of the three parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The improvement in classification that occurred when we included total power as a third parameter suggests that ultrasound plaque components may not consist solely of small, randomly distributed isotropic scatterers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our ability to identify plaque <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> provides motivation for future studies of parameter-based imaging methods for identifying such plaque that presents an increased risk of embolic neurologic ischemic events </plain></SENT>
