<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 12 of these cases carotid occlusion was diagnosed by ophthalmodynamography and Doppler ultrasonography of the orbital vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Angiographic substantiation was possible in nine of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pathognomonic importance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> for occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> is clearly shown by these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The plasma concentration of platelet specific proteins was examined in 32 patients and found to be pathologically increased in 13 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous aggregation of platelets and circulating platelet aggregates were only found in a few patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Due to the lack of coincidence between the event of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> and the time when platelet function tests were made no definite conclusions may be drawn from these results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Yet disturbances of platelet function must be taken into consideration in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
