<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects of the selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor glycine-binding site <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> SM-18400 on the mortality rate, deterioration of neurological signs, and formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> in the SHR-BCAo model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SM-18400 (15 or 30 mg/kg) was administered via the tail vein immediately and 2 h after BCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological signs were monitored continuously for 8 h after BCAo, and the mortality rates were followed for 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> SM-18400-treated animals were still alive 5 h after BCAo, whereas 38% of the animals died in the vehicle-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mortality rates of the SM-18400-treated groups were still lower than those of the vehicle-treated group 5 days after BCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, SM-18400 markedly prevented the deterioration of neurological signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The water content of the telencephalon and diencephalon/mesencephalon in the vehicle-treated group, measured 3 h after BCAo, was significantly higher than in the sham-operated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SM-18400 significantly inhibited the increase in water content in both regions in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptors participate in the increase in the mortality rate, deterioration of neurological signs, and formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> following ischemic brain damage in the SHR-BCAo model, and that SM-18400 can prevent ischemic insults </plain></SENT>
