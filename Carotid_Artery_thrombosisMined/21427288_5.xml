<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that oxidized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> (oxLDL) formed in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> initiated a CD36-mediated signaling cascade leading to platelet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now show that the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> nucleotide exchange factors Vav1 and Vav3 were tyrosine phosphorylated in platelets exposed to oxLDL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pharmacologic inhibition of src family kinases abolished Vav1 phosphorylation by oxLDL in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Coimmunoprecipitations revealed the tyrosine phosphorylated form of src kinase Fyn was associated with Vav1 in platelets exposed to oxLDL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using a platelet aggregation assay, we demonstrated that Vav1 deficiency, Fyn deficiency, or Vav1/Vav3 deficiency protected mice from diet-induced platelet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis revealed that Vav1/Vav3 deficiency significantly inhibited oxLDL-mediated integrin αIIbβIII activation of platelets costimulated with <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, we showed with an in vivo carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model that genetic deletion of Vav1 and Vav3 together may prevent the development of occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in mice fed a high-fat diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings implicate Vav proteins in oxLDL-mediated platelet activation and suggest that Vav family member(s) may act as critical modulators linking a prothrombotic state and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
