<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have developed potent and selective thrombin inhibitors with a novel non-peptidic structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A bicyclic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24995">lactam</z:chebi> was used as the scaffold on which various P1 and P3 motifs were substituted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein, we report the in vitro and in vivo properties of four representatives of this novel class of inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their Ki values were less than 10 nM, they inhibited equally both free and clot-bound thrombin, and they displayed high level of specificity for thrombin over other serine proteases (trypsin, factor Xa, activated Protein C, and plasmin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They prolonged the clotting time of human plasma to twice the control value in coagulation assays (TT, APTT, and PT) at a concentration below 3 microM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activities using rat plasma were similar to, although slightly weaker, than with human plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, they inhibited thrombin-induced platelet aggregation (human and rat) at concentrations close to their Ki values for thrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These molecules demonstrated similar dose response antithrombotic efficacy in rat arterial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> models when given as i.v. bolus followed by infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Antithrombotic efficacy of 85% and greater was observed at a dose of 5-7 microM/kg/hour in each model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bicyclic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24995">lactam</z:chebi> inhibitor 3, at a dose which caused a complete inhibition of visible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in the venous and arterial models of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, showed a 1.9-2.1 and a 4.0-4.8-fold shift in APTT and TT, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, the bicyclic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24995">lactam</z:chebi> inhibitors exhibited low oral bioavailability in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this novel class of bicyclic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24995">lactam</z:chebi> thrombin inhibitor has the potential to be promising intravenous antithrombotic agents for the treatment of arterial as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and warrants further investigation </plain></SENT>
