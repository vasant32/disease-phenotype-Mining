<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The importance of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) in the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is well recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have established a reproducible stenosis model in hypercholesterolemic hamsters, and the process of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> or neointima was studied and compared with that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hamsters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The level of plasma <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> was 4.6 times higher in hamsters fed a high-cholesterol diet than in hamsters fed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> food </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endothelial injury in right common carotid arteries was induced using a modified catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Arterial blood flow was monitored continuously using a Doppler flow probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arterial patency after the initiation of injury in high-cholesterol hamsters was significantly changed as compared with that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hamsters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neointima was observed 2 wk after the vascular injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neointimal area of high-cholesterol hamsters was significantly larger than that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hamsters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To characterize the stenosis in hypercholesterolemic hamsters, we measured platelet aggregation, thrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and proliferating smooth muscle cells (SMC) in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The half-maximal inhibitory concentration value for platelet aggregation induced by thrombin or collagen, the DNA synthesis stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB, and 5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-2-deoxy-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> labeling indices (proliferating index of SMC in vivo) in high-cholesterol hamsters were each significantly higher than the comparable value from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hamsters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, specific binding of PDGF-BB in SMC was not different between the two types of hamsters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we investigated the inhibitory effects of probucol or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> on neointima formation using this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Probucol, but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi>, significantly reduced the neointimal area in hypercholesterolemic hamsters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings indicated that high levels of plasma <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> strongly contributed to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and neointima formation via both up-regulation of platelet aggregation and the enhancement of SMC proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This stenosis model may be useful for the investigation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
