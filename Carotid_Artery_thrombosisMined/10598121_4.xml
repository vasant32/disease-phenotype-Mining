<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>These studies were designed to examine the pharmacodynamic profile and antithrombotic efficacy of RPR120844, a competitive inhibitor of coagulation factor Xa, with a K(i) of 7 nM against human factor Xa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro, RPR120844 doubled activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) at concentrations of 1.54, 1.48, and 0.74 microM in plasma obtained from humans, dogs, and rats, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intravenous bolus administration of RPR 120844 at 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg to rats resulted in maximal increases in APTT of 1.8-, 2.6-, and 8.4-fold over baseline, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect on prothrombin time (PT) was less pronounced, resulting in a 4.4-fold increase at 3 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These effects were rapidly reversible; APTT and PT returned to control values by 30 min after dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intragastric administration to rats at 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg resulted in modest increases in APTT and PT of 1.5- and 1.3-fold over baseline at the highest dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels were estimated by anti-Xa activity by using an amidolytic, chromogenic assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels were 0.65, 1.29, and 2.45 microM at 30 min after dosing at 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intravenous administration to dogs at 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg produced maximal increases in APTT of 1.7- and 2.4-fold over baseline, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intragastric administration to dogs at 50 mg/kg resulted in maximal increases in APTT and PT of 1.7- and 1.1-fold over baseline, with peak plasma levels of 3.9 microM observed at 15 min after dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a rat model of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30812">FeCl2</z:chebi>-induced carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, RPR120844 (3 mg/kg, i.v. bolus + 300 microg/kg/min constant infusion; n = 4) significantly increased time-to-occlusion from 18+/-1 min (vehicle, n = 4) to 60 min (maximal observation time) and reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> mass from 5.5 +/- 0.2 mg (vehicle) to 1.4 +/- 0.2 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that RPR120844 is a potent, selective inhibitor of Xa that exhibits oral activity and is efficacious in a standard model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
