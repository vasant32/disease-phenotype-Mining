<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied clinical and imaging outcome of intravenous thrombolysis in MRI-selected patients with tandem ICA/<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion as compared to isolated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed data of MRI-selected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator within 6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initial perfusion and diffusion lesion volumes were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was assessed on follow-up imaging after 5 to 8 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recanalization/reperfusion was assessed after 24 hours using MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Favorable outcome was defined as a modified Rankin scale score of 0 to 1 after 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 38 patients with proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, 14 (37%) had a tandem ICA/<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median NIHSS on admission (15 vs 15), initial perfusion (246 vs 246 mL), and diffusion lesion volume (22 vs 21 mL), final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (30 vs 39 mL), and the proportion of patients with a favorable outcome after 3 months (50% vs 46%) were similar in tandem ICA/<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion versus isolated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of tissue at risk appears to play a key role for the likelihood of clinical recovery after intravenous tissue plasminogen activator treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with tandem ICA/<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There appears to be no evidence to exclude patients with tandem ICA/<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion from intravenous thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
