<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After the intravenous injection of recombinant human FVIII and/or of purified FVIII-free human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (vWF), a controlled mild injury was inflicted on the carotid artery of FVB mice by irradiation with filtered green light in combination with intravenous injection of the dye <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Formation of a platelet-rich <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was continuously monitored for 40 min via transillumination and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> size was measured via image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Administration of recombinant human FVIII at 40 microg/kg led to initial FVIII plasma activities equivalent to 250% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human plasma FVIII activity and significantly enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining illustrated the accumulation of FVIII within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Human vWF, even at 10 mg/kg, had no effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The thrombotic tendency induced by FVIII was significantly inhibited by the administration of human vWF in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Separate plasma measurements revealed that human FVIII has comparable affinities for human and murine vWF but that human vWF does not effectively bind murine platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The inhibition by human vWF of the thrombotic tendency induced by human FVIII could therefore be explained by a lack of accumulation of FVIII within the developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> because of the reduced affinity of human vWF for murine platelets and the reduced occupancy of murine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor by human FVIII after injection of human vWF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results show that vWF actively participates in FVIII accumulation in the arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and provide experimental evidence for epidemiological findings that elevated plasma FVIII levels are associated with an increased thrombotic risk, also in arteries </plain></SENT>
