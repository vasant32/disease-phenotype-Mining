<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> of the CCA was produced by a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi>-mediated photochemical insult and regional patterns of blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) disruption were documented by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) histochemistry at 15 min (n = 12), 4 h (n = 3), 1 day (n = 5) or 7 days (n = 5) after vascular injury </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Extravasated HRP was associated with well-perfused arterioles and arterioles containing <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> platelet aggregates at different stages of degranulation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Variable degrees of parenchymal injury were documented including dendritic and astrocytic swelling with neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 7 days, vessels permeable to HRP were associated with tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, reactive astrocytes and microglial infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Arteriole wall thickening and leukocyte accumulation within arterioles and venules were also detected </plain></SENT>
