<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histological findings confirmed the platelet-rich composition of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Platelet accumulation at the stimulus site was quantitated with "'<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">Indium</z:chebi>-labelling of autologous platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In rabbits injected intravenously with either 2 mg/kg dazoxiben or 10 mg/kg aspirin, accumulation of labelled platelets was considerably reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals which received vehicle injection only, showed no such reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In separate experiments in anaesthetised rabbits, the levels of TxB2 and 6KPGF1 alpha in clotting blood were measured in blood samples taken from animals which had received the above drug treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aspirin markedly reduced the production of both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32395">arachidonate</z:chebi> metabolites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, dazoxiben almost totally inhibited TxB2 production but caused a 3.5 fold increase in the levels of 6KPGF1 alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate an anti-thrombotic effect and confirm the mechanistic selectivity of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> synthetase inhibitor </plain></SENT>
