<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lesions have a preferential topography according to etiology: internal carotid for blunt trauma and arteriographic lesions, common carotid for penetrating injuries, common and bifurcation for X-ray lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arteriography and surgical exploration confirm this notion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Macroscopic lesions don't always accord to the classical aspect: thus, only one intimal lesion has been found in blunt trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptomatology is orientated by etiology: neurological symptoms in blunt trauma and X-ray lesions, vascular symptoms in penetrating injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis has sometimes been made at a distance from the initial accident and in unusual circumstances, mainly in blunt trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The treatment has been a surgical one except for usual countra-indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results are favourable on young subjects and above <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> for particular lesions such as penetrating injuries and X-ray lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lastly, the authors insist on the post-operative evolutivity which is often misunderstood, and on the interest of an angiographic control </plain></SENT>
