<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we investigated whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> inhibit platelet-mediated arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in vivo and, if so, the underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were divided into 4 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group 1 was treated with the vehicle, whereas groups 2, 3, and 4 were treated with cerivastatin for 7 days (1, 2, and 5 mg/kg i.p., respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerivatatin did not change serum cholesterol levels </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that in vivo administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> protects against platelet-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, possibly by augmenting platelet- and endothelium-derived NO releases via up-regulation of platelet and endothelial NOS </plain></SENT>
