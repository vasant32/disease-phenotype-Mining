<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe the pharmaceutical effect of Chinese drugs for activating blood circulation (Xiongshao Capsule, XSC, ) and for activating blood circulation and detoxification (Xiongshao Capsule and Huanglian Capsule, XSHLC, ) in terms of the indices of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, inflammatory reaction and tissue damage related factors in experimental carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty Wistar rats were randomly divided into the sham operation group, the model group, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> group (SG), the activating blood circulation (ABC) group, and the activating blood circulation and detoxifying (ABCD) group, with 10 rats in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> (1.8 mg/kg), XSC (0.135 g/kg) and XSHLC (0.135 g/kg) were administered to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi>, ABC and ABCD group by gastrogavage, and an equal volume of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline was given to the sham operation group and the model group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 2 weeks of successive medication, the rats in the model and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> drug therapy groups were made into experimental carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The serum levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-9), tissue inhibitors to metalloproteinase (TIMP-1), granule membrane protein-140 (<z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi>-140), tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were detected with enzyme-linked immunoassay 24 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the model group, the levels of serum <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi>-140, hs-CRP, IL-6 and MMP-9 were significantly decreased, and the level of t-PA was significantly increased in the ABC and ABCD group ( P&lt;0.05), while the level of serum hs-CRP in ABCD group decreased significantly compared with that in the ABC group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Chinese drugs both for activating blood circulation and for activating blood circulation and detoxifying have good effects on regulating indices of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, inflammatory reaction and tissue damage in experimental carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect of activating blood circulation and detoxifying drugs on regulating the level of serum hs-CRP is superior to that of activating blood circulation drug alone </plain></SENT>
