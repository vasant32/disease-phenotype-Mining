<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report the results of balloon angioplasty in recurrent carotid occlusive disease and evaluate the potential for stent implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Between April 1991 and September 1995, 15 patients with carotid restenosis underwent 17 endoluminal procedures in 3 common carotid and 14 internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two postdilation complications (dissection and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusion) required prompt stenting; one common carotid artery was stented for postdilation residual stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One recurrent lesion was also stented 6 months after initial angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 1 silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, and 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> occurred in the balloon angioplasty patients (33% neurological complication rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The common carotid stent patient died 3 days postoperatively due to hyperperfusion syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up in two stent patients showed no restenosis at 18 and 48 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 11 balloon angioplasty patients likewise have not demonstrated restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Balloon angioplasty alone appears too risky for treating recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stents may offer a safer alternative, particularly when implanted primarily </plain></SENT>
