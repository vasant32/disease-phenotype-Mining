<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Carotid endarterectomies (CEAs) with standard <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi>) patching have been shown to have results comparable with those of autogenous vein patching; however, prolonged <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> through needle holes in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi> is a commonly recognized problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is the first study of CEA using a new hemostatic modified <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi> patch (GORE-TEX) analyzing the early and late outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred consecutive CEAs were entered into this protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had an immediate postoperative carotid duplex ultrasound scan that was repeated at 1 month and every 6 to 12 months thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free survival and the risk of restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 21 months (range, 1 to 48 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was 1.5% (1% ipsilateral and 0.5% contralateral, two minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and one major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) with no perioperative mortality or perioperative carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> was 3.5% (2.5% ipsilateral and 1% contralateral) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean hemostasis time after completion of the patching was 3 minutes, in contrast to 14 minutes for conventional <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi> (in a previous study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rates of freedom from ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years were 99%, 99%, 99%, and 99%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cumulative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free survival rates at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years were 98%, 96%, 93%, and 93%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The rates of freedom from &gt; or =70% restenosis at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years were 97%, 97%, 94%, and 94%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CEAs with a new modified <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi> patch are safe, have low perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates, are durable, and have an acceptable hemostasis time </plain></SENT>
