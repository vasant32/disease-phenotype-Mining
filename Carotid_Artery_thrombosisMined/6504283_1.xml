<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unilateral common carotid endarterectomies 3 mm in length were performed on 25 rats using microsurgical techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pattern of endothelial regrowth after endarterectomy, the pinocytosis of regenerated endothelial cells, and the effects of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> synthetase inhibitor on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation were examined 7 days after the resumption of flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pinocytotic vesicular transport in endothelial cells was evaluated using horseradish peroxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> endarterectomized vessels in both control and drug-treated groups were patent 7 days after operation without apparent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333205,C1260883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mural thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regenerated endothelial cells had spindle-shaped nuclei and cell bodies with long axes oriented parallel to the direction of blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were several instances where the leading edge of the endothelium at the distal end was reflected back in the distal direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The extent of the endothelial ingrowth was often greater from the proximal end of the endarterectomy than from the distal end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that hemodynamic force affects endothelial regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pinocytotic activity was less in the regenerated endothelium than in either the endothelium remaining at the periphery of the endarterectomy or the endothelium of the control animals </plain></SENT>
