<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Angiography, the "gold standard" vascular imaging modality, is an invasive procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it is time-consuming and thus may delay a needed vascular intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of screening angiography are negative in more than 80% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore other less invasive and faster screening tests, such as the Doppler ultrasound and magnetic resonance angiography, have been tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study was done to evaluate the use of CT angiography (CTA) in suspected vascular injuries of the neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: from 1995 to 1998, 16 patients with suspected traumatic carotid artery injury underwent CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve of these patients had penetrating injuries and four had blunt injuries to the neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CTAs were obtained by Elscint Twin Flash Spiral Scanner, while MIP reconstructions were carried out on an Omnipro, Elscint (Indy, Silicon Graphics) work station and interpreted by a radiologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the CTAs were diagnostic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Positive findings included one complete tear of the right common carotid artery (confirmed by surgery) due to a penetrating injury and one bilateral internal carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> after blunt injury to the neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, three patients with multiple trauma were operated on, due to either proximity only or questionable neurological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Surgical exploration confirmed the negative findings seen on CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CT angiography of the carotid arteries in cervical trauma may be used as an accurate decisive tool for a needed surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>More studies with larger number of patients and comparison with angiography are needed </plain></SENT>
