<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To establish and evaluate a rabbit model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> by modified thread-drawing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-three rabbits were randomly divided into 6 groups: a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group, a ligating group,a collagen encapsulated thread-drawing group,a aspirin group,a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> group, and an aspirin clopidogral group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The endovascular pathological changes in the rabbits were observed, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15824,37721">D-fructose</z:chebi>-1,6-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> trisodium salt octahydrate (FDP), D-Dimer and tissue factor (TF) were detected with enzyme linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the thread-drawing group, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was obvious, and the endovascular elastic membrane was injured seriously compared with the ligating group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After being treated with aspirin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi>, most arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was softened, dissolved and absorbed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with that in the modified thread-drawing group,wet and dry weight of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> increased,and the level of D-Dimer, FDP and TF also increased in the modified thread-drawing group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After being treated by aspirin and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi>, the wet and dry weight of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and the level of D-Dimer, FDP and TF decreased compared with the control (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aspirin plus clopidogral could obviously reduce the wet and dry weight of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, and reduce the level of D-Dimer and FDP (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aspirin plus clopidogral could obviously inhibit the formation of TF compared with aspirin (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>Arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> model by collagen encapsulated thread-drawing which is visible, repeatable and effective is better than thread-drawing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is suitable for screening anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> drugs and evaluating their effect </plain></SENT>
