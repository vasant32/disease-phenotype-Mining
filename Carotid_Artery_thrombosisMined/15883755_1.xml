<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the antiplatelet effect of cilostazol (Pletal) and its interaction with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> in in vitro and in vivo rabbit models, and to see if it can be dissociated from <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time prolongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In vitro collagen-induced platelet aggregation was measured by an impedance-based aggregometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The in vivo antithrombotic effect was evaluated in a rabbit carotid artery cyclic flow reduction (CFR) model, in which repetitive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was induced by mechanical injuries of the artery and stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Template <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time was determined in rabbit ear arterioles and hindlimb nail cuticles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In vitro platelet aggregation was slightly inhibited by 4 microM cilostazol (22 +/- 6%), and modestly by 13 microM (57 +/- 3% of aggregation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> itself up to 13 microM had no significant inhibition, it potentiated the effect from cilostazol: in the presence of 4 microM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi>, 4 microM cilostazol inhibited aggregation by 47 +/- 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">Dipyridamole</z:chebi> also potentiated the CFR reducing effect of cilostazol: combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> (no effect by itself) and cilostazol at 1 microM decreased CFRs to levels achieved by 3-4 microM cilostazol alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Bleeding</z:mp> times were similar in controls and animals treated with cilostazol, or with cilostazol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, aspirin (4 mg/kg), while reducing CFRs, significantly <z:hpo ids='HP_0003010'>increased bleeding time</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> potentiates the antiplatelet effect of cilostazol without prolongation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time, implying a potential novel combination antithrombotic therapy </plain></SENT>
