<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report our experience with carotid surgery during the past 11 years and a prospective randomized study on 600 patients with conventional thromb-endarterectomy (<z:chebi fb="29" ids="28621,35026">TEA</z:chebi>) versus eversion-endarterectomy (EEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>First results gave EEA a slight advantage, which could not be proved in the following years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both methods are equivalent in terms of postoperative and long-term results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up showed one difference between the two methods: Restenosis occurred more often in the <z:chebi fb="29" ids="28621,35026">TEA</z:chebi>-group (14.7% <z:chebi fb="29" ids="28621,35026">TEA</z:chebi> versus 6.5% EEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of symptomatic restenosis was the same in both groups (3.8% <z:chebi fb="29" ids="28621,35026">TEA</z:chebi> versus 3.9% EEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EEA did not show late restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We attribute this to the avoidance of patch-suture and the introduction of patch material, as was observed by other authors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No ruptures of venous patches occurred in our study after primary implantation, while two venous grafts ruptured after substitution of an infected Dacron patch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infection</z:e> rate for the Dacron patch was below 0.2% and is therefore negligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Duplex-ultrasound is indispensable in evaluating plaque-<z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, although sensitivity is low in the detection of dangerous <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> (73.4% for the soft plaque, 31.9% for ulcerations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In view of these results and a critical analysis of the current literature, we see slight advantages for EEA over <z:chebi fb="29" ids="28621,35026">TEA</z:chebi> inspite of equivalent operative results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, EEA is a suitable procedure only in connection with subtile intraoperative control and in the hand of an experienced surgeon </plain></SENT>
