<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since repetitive dosing is usually needed for thromboprophylaxis, study objectives were to determine whether repetitive oral <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> prevented <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> and to compare effectiveness to subcutaneous administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Wistar rats were given subcutaneous or oral unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> ([UFH] 1 mg/kg per 48 h), low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> ([LMWH] tinzaparin, 0.1 mg/kg per 12 h), or saline for 30 days </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), anti-factor Xa, and antithrombin activity were determined from the plasma </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Repeated treatment with oral <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> showed similar antithrombotic activity compared to subcutaneous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
