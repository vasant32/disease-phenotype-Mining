<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>87.8% of patients showed atherosclerotic changes of the carotids, 37.3% signs of ulceration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> cerebral ischemic events were more frequent than ocular ischemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Homogenous plaque formation without signs of ulceration was more correlated with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamically nonsignificant plaque formation in the carotid arteries may be an important cause of cerebral ischemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Heterogenous plaques cause bigger embolies than homogenous plaques </plain></SENT>
