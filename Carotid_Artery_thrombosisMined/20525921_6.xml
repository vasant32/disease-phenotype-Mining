<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with HIV-1 immune-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> have a unique antibody (Ab) against integrin GPIIIa49-66 capable of inducing oxidative platelet fragmentation via Ab activation of platelet <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25523">nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate</z:chebi> oxidase and 12-lipoxygenase releasing reactive oxygen species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a phage display single-chain antibody (scFv) library, we developed a novel human monoclonal scFv Ab against GPIIIa49-66 (named A11) capable of inducing fragmentation of activated platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the in vivo use of A11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that A11 does not induce significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> or inhibit platelet function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A11 can prevent the cessation of carotid artery flow produced by induced artery injury and dissolve the induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> 2 hours after cessation of blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, A11 can prevent, as well as ameliorate, murine middle cerebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> or brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To further optimize the antithrombotic activity of A11, we produced a bifunctional A11-plasminogen first kringle agent (SLK), which homes to newly deposited fibrin strands within and surrounding the platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, reducing effects on nonactivated circulating platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Indeed, SLK is able to completely reopen occluded carotid vessels 4 hours after cessation of blood flow, whereas A11 had no effect at 4 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, a new antithrombotic agent was developed for platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> clearance </plain></SENT>
