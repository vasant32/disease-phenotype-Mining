<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 10 men and 13 women with a mean age of 66 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The indication for interposition graft placement was recurrent stenosis with inability to perform endarterectomy in nine operations, a severe kink or technical problem during endarterectomy in nine, aneurysmal changes of the artery in six, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the endarterectomy site segment with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and no further perioperative neurologic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up with performance of yearly duplex scans was obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and the mean duration of follow-up was 36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient (4%) died of end-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e> during the study interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> graft occurred at 12 months in one patient (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamically significant restenosis developed in two patients (8%), and two patients (8%) had mild restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Evidence of a second restenosis developed in three of the nine patients who underwent <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> interposition graft placement for carotid restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the basis of our study results, we conclude that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> can be used effectively for carotid reconstruction when an interposition graft is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, recurrent stenosis occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients who undergo <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> interposition graft placement for carotid restenosis appear to be at high risk for a second restenosis </plain></SENT>
