<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The work about 5 cases, followed up 2 to 21 months, confirms the importance of this artery, in its substitute function in case of internal carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The problem is its functional future inside the atheriosclerosis evolutivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients had a revascularization of the stenotic external carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we proposed revascularization indications of the stenotic supplied external carotid artery: --When a neurologic ischemic attack exists, from stenosis or ulcerative plaques, revascularization surgery of this artery is indicated like for internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>--Asymptomatic significant stenosis or ulcerative plaque of supplied external carotid artery are indications for prophylactic surgery, knowing the evolutive risk and the insufficiency of the concerned hemispheric vascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>--But, frequent controls are sufficient when the stenosis is not significant </plain></SENT>
