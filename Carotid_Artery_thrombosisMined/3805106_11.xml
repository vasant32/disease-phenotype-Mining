<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven underwent operations using a standard carotid closure; a second group of forty-two patients had a saphenous vein patch graft applied in closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were evaluated with carotid duplex scans at regular intervals to evaluate the incidence of early restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with positive duplex scans underwent arterial angiography or digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Operative mortality was zero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred; eleven due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the unpatched group, 19.1% of the patients developed significant restenosis (a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing of greater than 50%) with only a 2.4% incidence occurring in the patched group, a statistically significant difference (p less that 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a higher incidence of symptomatic restenosis in the unpatched group, though the results were not considered significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Venous patch rupture was seen in three patients who have not been included in the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these had venous patches harvested from a distal greater saphenous vein site at the ankle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The authors recommend venous patch closure with a thicker patch taken from the proximal saphenous vein at the groin to reduce the incidence of early restenosis and to avoid venous patch rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Regular non-invasive evaluation is recommended to detect restenosis with careful clinical follow-up to evaluate neurologic complications </plain></SENT>
