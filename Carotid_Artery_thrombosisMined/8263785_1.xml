<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> was induced in the carotid artery by transmural vessel injury and in the vena cava by partial blood flow stasis combined with mild endothelial disruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Small mesenteric arteries were punctured with a hypodermic needle to measure the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dose-response relationships were determined with a thrombin active site inhibitor, N-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> (GYKI 14,766); a thrombin exosite inhibitor, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26810,37952">succinyl</z:chebi>-Phe-Glu-Pro<z:chebi fb="84" ids="32607">-Ile</z:chebi>-Pro-Glu-Glu-Tyr-cyclohexylalanine<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30011">-Gln </z:chebi>(BMS 180,742); and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BMS 180,742 interferes with fibrinogen binding to the thrombin exosite but, unlike GYKI 14,766, it does not block thrombin's catalytic site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effects on <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time were correlated with ex vivo clotting times using the activated partial thromboplastin time for <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and the thrombin time for GYKI 14,766 and BMS 180,742 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>Venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was inhibited more than 90% by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three inhibitors at doses that either produced threshold increases or had no effect on <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and clotting times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>Arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> was inhibited 82% by GYKI 14,766 and 63% by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> but it was not inhibited by BMS 180,742 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These antithrombotic activities were accompanied by a maximal activated partial thromboplastin time increase and doubling of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and a maximal thrombin time prolongation and 35% increase in <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time with GYKI 14,766 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that thrombin inhibitors, which act at the active site or exosite or through antithrombin III, are equally efficacious against <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> but active site inhibitors are the most effective against <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
