<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To differentiate between gaseous and particular microemboli in carotid surgery one clinical approach is the interpretation of the effective sample volume length (SVL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether such a clinical interpretation is based on reproducible measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) recorded during carotid endarterectomy by a bigated transcranial Doppler device were analyzed off-line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the two sample volumes, the duration and the velocity of the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were measured by two observers independently from each other twice within 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The SVL of the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were calculated by multiplying duration with velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the anatomical proximal sample volume 215 MES were recorded of which 203 (94.5%) were also present in the distal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SVL medians of the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were 2.2-4.1 mm lower in the distal than in the proximal sample volume as a result of lower velocity and shorter duration of the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in the distal sample volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median of the paired differences of the SVL was 0.2 mm (interquartile range: 0.0-1.2) in the proximal sample volume and 0.8 mm (0.2-1.8) in the distal sample volume for observer 1, and 0.6 mm (0.4-2.2) and 0.9 mm (0.5-1.6) for observer 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median of the paired differences of the SVL between the observers was 1.4 mm (1.2-2.9) in the proximal sample volume and 1.6 mm (1.3-3.0) in the distal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The intra- and interobserver agreement on calculating SVL is good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the depth of insonation influences some features of embolic signals </plain></SENT>
