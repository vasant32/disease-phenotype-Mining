<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Out of 550 patients examined by Doppler ultrasound 111 patients underwent carotid angiography and the angiographic data were compared with the noninvasive results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic accuracy was 91% in cases with stenoses greater than 50% and occlusion; in cases with stenoses of greater than 50% it was 86% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Occlusions could always be verified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Doppler ultrasound is very valuable for follow-up examinations after reconstructive procedures of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
