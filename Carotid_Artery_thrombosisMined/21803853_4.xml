<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is a currently prevailing concept that No and cGMP inhibits platelet function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the data supporting the inhibitory role of NO/sGC/cGMP in platelets have been obtained either in vitro or using whole body gene deletion that affects vessel wall function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we have generated mice with sGC gene deleted only in megakaryocytes and platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using the megakaryocyte- and platelet-specific sGC-deficient mice, we identify a stimulatory role of sGC in platelet activation and in <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Deletion of sGC in platelets abolished cGMP production induced by either NO donors or platelet <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>, caused a marked defect in aggregation and attenuated secretion in response to low doses of collagen or thrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, megakaryocyte- and platelet-specific sGC deficient mice showed prolonged tail-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> times and impaired FeClâ‚ƒ-induced carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of the NO donor SNP on platelet activation was sGC-dependent only at micromolar concentrations, but sGC-independent at millimolar concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together, our data demonstrate important roles of sGC in stimulating platelet activation and in vivo <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and hemostasis, and sGC-dependent and -independent inhibition of platelets by NO donors </plain></SENT>
