<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To develop an animal model of a fibrin- and platelet-rich intraluminal arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> with abnormal mural substrate to simulate in situ <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of human atherosclerotic arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Parallel studies of the crush-thrombin model (CT) and double-tuck model (DT) were performed and evaluated with use of angiography and histologic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten Yorkshire swine (1-6 months; 20-30 kg; 10 females) underwent right femoral and carotid cutdowns performed after administration of general anesthesia (4 mL intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> 2% in 1 L of oxygen) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After angiography, the CT model was created in the left carotid artery and the DT model was performed in the right carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiograms were obtained at 20 minutes (n = 1), at 1 hour (n = 3), at 2 hours (n = 4), and at 3 hours (n = 2) before sacrifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After sacrifice, histologic specimens were stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin (H-E stain) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53394">phosphotungstic acid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> for fibrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The specimens were examined for endothelial irregularity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, platelet aggregation, fibrin layering, vessel wall injury, and adventitial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The findings were quantified as 0 = absent, 1+ = slight, 2+ = moderate, and 3+ = severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Angiographic results were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, histologic analysis of the CT model showed severe damage to the arterial wall with dissection in nine of 10 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the DT model, no dissection was found (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Endothelial irregularity was found in six of 10 arteries treated with the CT method, as compared with nine of 10 arteries prepared with the DT model; endothelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> was found in five DT arteries and in four CT arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Platelet aggregation was present equally in both methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A fibrin- and platelet-rich <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was created in five of 10 examined arteries by both methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The DT model creates endothelial irregularity leading to formation of a platelet- and fibrin-rich <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, adherent to the vessel wall without damage to the media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This contrasts with the CT method, which created medial dissection in nine of 10 arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>One hour is the minimum time required to produce a good quality <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>; 2 hours is the optimum time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The DT model is proposed as a useful tool in the development of new devices, drugs, and biotechnologic advances </plain></SENT>
