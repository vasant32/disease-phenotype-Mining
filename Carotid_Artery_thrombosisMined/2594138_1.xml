<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors report two cases of complete occlusion of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In one case the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was probably caused by direct compression of the carotid siphon by a large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> arising from the inner third of the sphenoid wing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the other it was associated with multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205834" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">meningiomatosis</z:e> although there was no contiguity between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527390" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intracranial tumors</z:e> and the occluded carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a review of literature we think they are of some interest, and we have found an interesting incidence of association between <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
