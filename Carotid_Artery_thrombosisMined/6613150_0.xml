<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>15 of these patients had preoperatively focal EEG-changes, coinciding frequently with a cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> or with carotid changes also contralateral to the side of the desobliteration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>18 patients had during the carotid clamping EEG-changes (slowing of frequency and decrease in amplitude) or a worsening of preoperative changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>15 of these patients had a complete recovery of these changes after unclamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The EEG changes do occur more frequent in patients who had a cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> or bilateral carotid changes preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since the EEG-changes during the carotid clamping do signal a critical lowering of the brain perfusion, an ischemic etiology has to be assumed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The use of a shunt during the procedure to prevent irreversible ischemic damage seems therefore to be justified </plain></SENT>
