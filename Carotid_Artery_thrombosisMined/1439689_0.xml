<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The records of 485 patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy between 1978 and 1991 were reviewed, with special attention to both cardiac and neurological complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>432 patients had symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> whereas 53 were asymptomatic but presented with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> or a large ulceration at doppler-duplex examination and/or angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These examinations showed the following lesions in symptomatic patients: unilateral stenosis &gt; 75% (331; 68.5%), ulceration (41; 8.5%), bilateral stenosis (61; 12.5%) and unilateral stenosis with contralateral occlusion (51; 10.5%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall early mortality was 1.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients died from the sequelae of a neurologic injury, whereas six patients died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Late mortality was essentially due to ischemic cardiac complications (38.5% of the actuarial late mortality at 8 years) </plain></SENT>
