<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory rate of TCHI at different concentrations on platelet aggregation was determined by platelet aggregometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship between dose and effect was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of troxerutin and cerebroproptein hydrolysate injection on <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was determined by the carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the TCHI could inhibit <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and platelet aggregation in a concentration-dependent way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the concentration of TCHI total nitrogen was 5 µg/ml, the inhibition rate of platelet aggregation reached to the highest value of 28.61 ± 22.07%, which is 2.5 times as much as that with 100 µg/ml aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the TCHI has antiaggregative and antithrombotic activity effects against platelet aggregation and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
