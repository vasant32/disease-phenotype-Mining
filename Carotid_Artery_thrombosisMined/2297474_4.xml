<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventy-three patients over age 40 who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> without obvious cause and had ipsilateral stenoses of 50% or less with carotid duplex scanning were followed for a mean period of 35.5 months (range 3-110) without surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the initial vascular laboratory duplex evaluation, 35 patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> arteries (47.9%), 29 had minor (0-19%) stenoses of the ipsilateral internal carotid arteries (39.7%), and 11 had 20-50% stenosis (15.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four patients with 0-19% stenosis and one patient with 20-50% stenosis experienced a subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or permanent ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When analyzed by life-table format, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo>, and early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were more frequent in patients with minor degrees of stenosis than in those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Investigations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> should be aimed at identifying whether the symptoms are explained by arteriosclerotic, systemic, collagen, cardiac, hematologic, or ophthalmologic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When no other etiology is found, and localized carotid bifurcation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of even modest degrees is identified, an atheroembolic etiology should be considered </plain></SENT>
