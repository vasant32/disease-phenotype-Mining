<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A retrospective study of 129 carotid artery reconstructions with an occlusion of the contralateral internal carotid artery (group CO) is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A control group comprised 489 patients with a stenosis of &lt; 50% at the contralateral side (group CN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both groups had the same mean age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were fewer women in group CO (14% versus 31%, P &lt; 0.0001), and more patients had a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (57% versus 44%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition more patients of group CO had suffered a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (36% versus 27%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A temporary shunt was used selectively and more frequently in group CO (87% versus 31%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Major postoperative complications occurred with equal frequency in both groups: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> plus non-cerebral mortality (total combined morbidity and mortality): 4.65% versus 5.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The late incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was the same in both groups: 8% in CO and 7% in CN at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that, under the described circumstances and with the appropriate surgical technique, the presence of an occlusion of the contralateral internal carotid artery does not imply an increase in major postoperative complications nor a higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate during follow-up </plain></SENT>
