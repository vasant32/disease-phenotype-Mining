<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Platelets play important role in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Suppression of platelet activity by materials may decrease incidence of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to examine the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> from pork meat with antithrombotic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">Peptide</z:chebi> fraction or hydrolyzate of defatted pork meat by papain was used as the starting material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antithrombotic activity of the fraction was assessed by a share-induced platelet function test in vitro (haemostatometry) using non-anticoagulated rat blood, followed by a <z:chebi fb="64" ids="30217">helium</z:chebi>-neon laser-induced mouse carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> test in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The starting <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> fraction with mean molecular weight 2500 showed antithrombotic activity in vivo after oral administration to mice at 210 mg/kg body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The fraction with mean molecular weight 2517 further purified by <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cation</z:chebi> exchange chromatography showed antithrombotic activity after oral administration at 70 mg/kg body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Antithrombotic activity of the purified <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> fraction was equivalent to that of aspirin at 50 mg/kg body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is possible this pork <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> could be beneficial to prevent atherothrombosis </plain></SENT>
