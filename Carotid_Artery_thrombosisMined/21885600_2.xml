<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed data on cervical magnetic resonance angiography (cMRA) performed prospectively in 67 patients (55 children) for indications including transcranial Doppler (TCD) abnormalities, AIS, or previous AIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>cICA lesions were seen in 10 (15%) patients, including 4 of 7 patients presenting with AIS, and appear to have been missed on first presentation in 4 of 10 patients with previous AIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Radiologic features in 7 patients were consistent with dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients, there was strong clinical and radiologic evidence for thromboembolic AIS, and this was also considered possible in 4 other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of the 4 AIS patients were anticoagulated acutely, and the nontreated patient had recurrent, probably thromboembolic, AIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TCD findings were variable, but in 4 patients there were high velocities in the cerebral vessels contralateral to the cICA stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with AIS should have cMRA during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> evaluation to identify cICA occlusions that may require anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Routine screening of children with SCD should also include evaluation of neck vessels by carotid Doppler followed by cMRA if a cervical vascular lesion is suspected </plain></SENT>
