<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The current risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after carotid endarterectomy may be worse than reported in the international trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because studies have suggested that most operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> follow surgeon error, the aim of the current study was to audit the impact of introducing a strategy of perioperative monitoring and quality control assessment on outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 500 patients underwent carotid endarterectomy with intraoperative transcranial Doppler scan monitoring, completion angioscopy, and 3 hours of postoperative transcranial Doppler scan monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The last of these guided selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> therapy in patients with high rates of postoperative embolization, which in previous series has been shown to be highly predictive of progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intimal flaps were repaired in 3% of patients and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> removed in 4% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 0.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 313 patients had more than one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> detected postoperatively (96% within 2 hours of flow restoration), but only 22 patients had sustained embolization requiring <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Embolization ceased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi>, although the dose had to be increased in seven patients (36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient was unable to receive adequate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> therapy because of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, the 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was 2.2%, no patient had a perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> because of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and the rate of ipsilateral embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 0.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most complications resulted from cardiac pathology or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A program of monitoring and quality control assessment has been associated with a 60% decrease in the operative risk in comparison with that observed before implementation of the protocol </plain></SENT>
