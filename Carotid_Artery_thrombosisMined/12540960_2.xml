<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we evaluated the effect of LB30057 on the biological activities of thrombin at various tissues, and determined whether thrombin inhibition by LB30057 could reduce the incidence of occlusive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in an in vivo animal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment with LB30057 to human plasma <z:hpo ids='HP_0005542'>prolonged clotting times</z:hpo> in a concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LB30057 suppressed significantly thrombin-induced phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure in platelets, suggesting that LB30057 could inhibit blood coagulation accelerated by PS exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In human platelets, soluble thrombin- and clot-induced platelet aggregation was inhibited by LB30057 potently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this finding, LB30057 showed concentration-dependent inhibitory effects on <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> secretion and P-selectin expression induced by thrombin in platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the blood vessel isolated from the guinea pig, treatment with LB30057 resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of thrombin-induced vascular contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vivo study revealed that LB30057 following oral administration significantly increased the time to occlusion and improved carotid arterial patency using rat carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these results suggest that LB30057 is a potent inhibitor of biological activities of thrombin at various target tissues and, therefore, might be developed as an antithrombotic agent for treatment and prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
