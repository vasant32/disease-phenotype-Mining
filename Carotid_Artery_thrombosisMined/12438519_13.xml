<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to compare effects of DPC423, enoxaparin (low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>), and argatroban (thrombin inhibitor) on <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> and hemostasis in rabbit models of electrically induced carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and cuticle <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compounds were infused i.v. continuously from 60 min before artery injury or cuticle transection to the end of experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Carotid blood flow was used as a marker of antithrombotic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antithrombotic ED(50) values were 0.4 mg/kg/h for enoxaparin (n = 6), 0.13 mg/kg/h for argatroban (n = 6), and 0.6 mg/kg/h for DPC423 (n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DPC423 at the maximum antithrombotic dose increased activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time (n = 6) by 1.8 +/- 0.07- and 1.8 +/- 0.13-fold, respectively, without changes in thrombin time and ex vivo thrombin activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The antithrombotic effect of DPC423 was significantly correlated with its ex vivo anti-fXa activity (r = 0.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DPC423 at 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg p.o. increased carotid blood flow (percent control) at 45 min to 10 +/- 4, 24 +/- 6, and 74 +/- 7, respectively (n = 6/group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cuticle <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> times (percent change over control) determined at the maximum antithrombotic dose were 88 +/- 12 for argatroban, 69 +/- 13 for <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, 4 +/- 3 for enoxaparin, 5 +/- 4 for DPC423, and -3 +/- 2 for the vehicle (n = 5-6/group), suggesting dissociation of antithrombotic and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time effects for DPC423 and enoxaparin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The combination of aspirin and DPC423 at ineffective antithrombotic doses produced significant antithrombotic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these results suggest that DPC423 is a clinically useful oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> for the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
