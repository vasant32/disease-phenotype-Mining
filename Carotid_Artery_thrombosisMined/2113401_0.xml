<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) is thought to be a promising fibrinolytic agent because of its high affinity to fibrin without evidence of significant systemic fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The feasibility of t-PA and urokinase (UK) in local fibrinolytic therapy was investigated in a canine common carotid artery <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After the screening of coagulation-fibrinolytic activities, autologous blood clot was injected into the segment of intimal injured common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fibrinolytic agent was locally applied from the origin of the common carotid artery under temporary flow arrest with a double lumen balloon catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T-PA used in this study was produced by the cell culture technique of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Its activity was-expressed by AK units (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AKU</z:e>), namely, the fibrinolytic area of the fibrin-agar plate induced by 10 AKU/ml of t-PA solution corresponds to that of 10 IU/ml of UK solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The doses of t-PA required to produce angiographical recanalization were 600-1,200 AKU/kg (approximately 0.015-0.03 mg/kg) of t-PA, while 24,000 IU/kg was necessary for UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these doses, t-PA evoked no adverse effects on the plasma coagulation-fibrinolytic system, while UK produced significant decrease in plasma fibrinogen and alpha-2 plasmin inhibitor levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, t-PA may be considered to have higher fibrinolytic ability and lower adverse effect on the plasma coagulation-fibrinolytic system than UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Local fibrinolytic therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> using t-PA is considered to be a promising intravascular therapeutic procedure with less systemic fibrinolytic complications such as hemorrhagic infarction </plain></SENT>
