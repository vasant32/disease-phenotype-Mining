<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was performed in the anesthetized dog to determine if <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> prevents <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> and/or reocclusion after thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Carotid and coronary arteries were instrumented with Doppler(TM) flow probes, a critical stenosis, infusion line and an anodal electrode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two protocols were employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> protocol, intracarotid infusion of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> (20 microg/kg/min for 3 h) did not alter cyclic flow variations or patency during induction of vessel wall injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the second protocol, occlusive arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were induced by anodal current injury and lysed with local application of tissue plasminogen activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whereas <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> prolonged the time to <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp>, it did not affect cyclic flow variations or time to reocclusion after thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
