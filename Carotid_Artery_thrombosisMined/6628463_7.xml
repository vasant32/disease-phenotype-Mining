<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>21 patients with intracranial obstruction of an internal carotid artery (ICA) (15 stenoses, 6 occlusions) were studied for angiographic, clinical and prognostic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence of atheromatous changes and associated risk factors did not significantly differ from age- and sex-matched controls with extracranial ICA disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No significant difference occurred between matched groups with extra- or intracranial ICA obstruction in functional outcome, delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, suggesting that prognosis was more related to age, sex and degree of obstruction than to level of obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>80% intracranial stenosis patients had the worst functional outcome, 30-60% stenosis patients the best, and occlusion patients were intermediate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This corresponded to higher risk of delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with 80% stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prognosis was better in patients without evidence of proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002635'>atheromatosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 1 patient with intracranial occlusion suffered delayed homolateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> in which atheromatous embolization from stenosed contralateral ICA was hypothetized </plain></SENT>
