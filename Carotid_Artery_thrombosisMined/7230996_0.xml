<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Especially the speechaudiometrical examination extends the possibilities of previous noninvasive and invasive procedures (ultrasonic-Doppler-examination, angiography, nuclear-medical investigations, computertomography) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With that follows new tasks for the otorhinolaryngological physician as he is able to impart his main statements to other physicians (particularly to internists inclusive angiologists and neurologists) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between 1976 and 959 adults with functional cerebrovascular impairments audiometrically examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To about 10 percent of the pure-tone audiometrical curves to explicable alteration was to be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Deviation in the speechaudiogram without relation to the pure-tone audiometrical curve was proved in 50 to 60 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The important statements represent the pathological loss of the discrimination in the speechaudiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results are discussed according to the following classified diseases: a) general cerebral vascular functional disorders, b) obliterations of extra and intra cranial vessels (e.g. stenosis of the carotid artery), c) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral dysfunctions</z:e> (e.g. alcohol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8050">phenacetin</z:chebi> abuse, cranial brain injury, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Each exclusion of an acoustic impairments which can be casually not be distinguished should involve the examination of the extra and intra cranial vessels because very often the loss of discrimination of the speech-audiogram (and sometimes also no confirmed puretone audiometrical result) is valued as leading symptom for obliteration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The connexion from ultrasonic-Doppler examination and speechaudiometry may be used as screening method in order to conform the suspicion for an <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> in cases of unclear etiology </plain></SENT>
