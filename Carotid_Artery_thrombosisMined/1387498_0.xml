<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Against a background of changing indications, tactics and techniques the aim of the study was to detect any differences between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group A had a higher proportion of coronary and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The states of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> I, II and III were distributed equally, but state IV was seen more frequently in group B (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of shunt/without shunt operations in group A was 97/2, in group B 10/84 (p less than 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The external carotid artery was deobliterated in 58/81 cases group A versus group B (p less than 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We closed the artery by direct suture in 8/31 (p less than 0.005), by autologous venous patch in 53/26 (p less than 0.005) and by Dacron patches in 39/41 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In group A the operative mortality was zero and in group B 1 patient died; one patient in group B developed sudden occlusion (with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transient intra-/postoperative neurological deficits occurred in 1/2, permanent in 4/2 patients (n.s.) </plain></SENT>
