<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In reviewing the symptoms and signs associated with bilateral carotid occlusions and the clinical course, several patterns became evident and in this report the patients are divided into 3 types: Apoplectic type, those who had severe neurological deficit acutely after occlusion, whose angiography showed impaired or absent collateral circulation, and whose CT scan demonstrated bilateral diffuse low density areas; Progressing type, those whose neurological signs and symptoms grew progressively serious, whose angiography showed moderate or adequate retrograde filling with collateral circulation through posterior cerebral arteries and whose CT scan demonstrated low density lesions in the bilateral frontal lobes; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>  </plain></SENT>
