<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective open clinical study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 455 carotid duplex scans with a greater than 50% stenosis were analysed in terms of gender, age, degree of stenosis symptoms and plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 238 males (52.3%) and 217 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 120 patients with type I plaque 86 were male (71.7%, chi 2 = 23.4, p = 0.000002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This high incidence of type I (haemorrhagic) plaque in men was accompanied by a higher degree of stenosis (chi 2 = 11.7 p = 0.0006) but was independent of the age of the patients and the presence of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although this study supports the view that men have more severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e>, it does not to affect a younger age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The higher degree of stenosis and its association with haemorrhagic plaque is not translated into an increase in symptoms in men </plain></SENT>
