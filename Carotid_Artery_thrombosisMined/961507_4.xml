<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The application of microvascular techniques to neurosurgery demands microscopic and ultrastructural examinations of the effects of such interventions on small vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histological examinations can help to provide answers to questions concerning operating technique, ultrastructural examinations give information on the indications for operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since these questions have not been studied previously, preliminary examinations on easily accessible vessels are necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, the common carotid artery of the rat was chosen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological and ultrastructural examinations were carried out on end-to-end anastomoses of these vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ultrastructural findings are described and compared with anatomical findings in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal vessels in the rat </plain></SENT>
