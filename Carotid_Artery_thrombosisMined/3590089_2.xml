<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clamping of the carotid artery for 5 min resulted in the simultaneous accumulation of platelets and fibrin at the site of injury over the next 45 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under the electron microscope the response was seen to range from platelet monolayer <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333205,C1260883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mural thrombus</z:e> formation with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>fibrin deposition</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In animals rendered thrombocytopenic, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>fibrin deposition</z:mpath> was impaired during the first 15-20 minutes after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basic coagulation times and fibrinogen concentration were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition the injured vessels in these animals accumulated more radiolabelled albumin, but not erythrocytes, than injured vessels in control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results may imply a role for platelets in the enhancement of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>fibrin deposition</z:mpath> during the early part of the response to injury and in contributing to the maintenance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> permeability following vessel injury </plain></SENT>
