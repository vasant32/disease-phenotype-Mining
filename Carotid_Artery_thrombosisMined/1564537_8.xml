<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A standardized surgical protocol aimed at restoration of flow in the vessel was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Presenting symptoms included hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> in 68% of patients, new fixed neurological deficits in 28%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> in 28%, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-in-evolution in 9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four arteries were successfully reopened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A proximal remnant angioplasty (stumpectomy) was performed alone in nine patients or in combination with an external carotid endarterectomy in nine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In four patients with persisting symptoms who failed to achieve primary restoration of flow, a superficial temporal-to-middle cerebral artery bypass procedure was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The permanent surgical morbidity rate was 2% and the surgical mortality rate was 0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transient postoperative deficits were present in three patients (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up review at a mean of 40 months was obtained in 39 patients (93%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Following surgical intervention, five patients died of unrelated causes, two had neurological events consistent with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient cerebral ischemic attack</z:e>, and two had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar insufficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patient suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the 24 successfully reopened vessels, follow-up ultrasound evaluations were obtained in 17 (73%) at a mean of 28 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 15 patients (88%) the vessels were widely patent, one (5.8%) had stenosis greater than 70%, and one (5.8%) showed asymptomatic reocclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Reopening occluded internal carotid arteries in selected patients is associated with low surgical morbidity and mortality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further studies are necessary to determine the impact of this surgical therapy on the natural history of this condition </plain></SENT>
