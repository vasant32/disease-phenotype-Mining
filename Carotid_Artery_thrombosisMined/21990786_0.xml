<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo>, simultaneous, concomitant internal carotid artery (ICA) and middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusions almost invariably lead to significant neurological disability if left untreated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endovascular therapy is frequently the method of treatment in such situations but there remains a chance of incomplete recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Successful recanalization of the proximal aspect of the occlusion may allow for endogenous thrombolysis and facilitate further endogenous recanalization of any residual <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> undergoing endovascular therapy for tandem extracranial ICA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> or contiguous intracranial ICA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusions were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rates of facilitated endogenous recanalization at 24 h (FER(24)) were compared by imaging within the immediate post-intervention 5-24 h period in those with proximal recanalization and in those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 17 patients were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>12 patients had good initial proximal recanalization but a residual partial or total occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> while five patients failed any recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (58.3%) in the first group and none in the second had FER(24) on interval imaging after intervention (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The probability of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and disability at discharge was less in patients with FER(24) than those without (p=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: More than half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who present with both ICA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusions who are only partially recanalized will undergo facilitated endogenous recanalization within the subsequent 24 h following intervention </plain></SENT>
