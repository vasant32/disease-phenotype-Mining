<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these 44 were selected for surgery on the basis of duplex assessment alone, 48 after carotid angiography and duplex scanning and six after angiography alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No difference between the groups of patients was observed for either perioperative or follow-up complication rates, although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred in patients who had been examined by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By the end of the study period angiography was requested for less than 30% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is argued that the change in our practice is safe provided that certain criteria are met </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These include angiography in cases of suspected aortic arch or proximal vessel disease and in those symptomatic patients with a duplex diagnosis of complete occlusion </plain></SENT>
