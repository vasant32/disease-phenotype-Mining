<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TF pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is a major physiological inhibitor of TF-initiated coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to define the complex interplay between TF and TFPI and the regulation of vascular thrombogenicity in a model of vascular remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine the levels and pattern of vascular expression of TF and TFPI associated with vascular remodeling, a murine model of flow cessation was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TF activity of the arteries increased after ligation (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Quantitative analysis of homogenates of remodeled carotid arteries revealed increased TF expression but unchanged TFPI expression compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> carotid arteries, resulting in enhanced TF activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To determine the potential therapeutic role of TFPI in this thrombogenic state, mice were treated with intravascular adenoviral delivery of either murine TFPI (Ad-mTFPImyc) or a control adenovirus (Ad-DeltaE1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of TFPI decreased vascular TF activity compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> control (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of TFPI inhibited neointimal formation (P=0.038), resulting in enhanced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> area (P=0.001) 4 weeks after flow cessation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this murine model of vascular remodeling, an imbalance between TF and TFPI expression is generated, resulting in increased TF activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of TFPI in this model inhibits vascular TF activity and results in attenuation of vascular remodeling associated with flow interruption </plain></SENT>
