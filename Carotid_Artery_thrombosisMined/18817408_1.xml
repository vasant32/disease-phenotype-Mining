<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3918">crocetin</z:chebi> on platelet activity and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> formation were systematically investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3918">Crocetin</z:chebi> showed a dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>, collagen, but not by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3918">Crocetin</z:chebi> significantly attenuated dense granule release, while neither platelets <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to collagen nor cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> level was altered by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3918">crocetin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3918">crocetin</z:chebi> was confirmed to partially inhibit Ca (2+) mobilization via reducing both intracellular Ca (2+) release and extracellular Ca (2+) influx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Besides that, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3918">crocetin</z:chebi> prolonged the occlusive time in electrical stimulation-induced carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
