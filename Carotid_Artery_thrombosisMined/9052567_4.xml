<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Atherosclerotic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (CAS) is the most common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively studied clinical characteristics of premature CAS and the safety and durability of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in 56 patients 50 years of age or younger (mean, 46.4 years; 34 (60%) males; group I) who underwent primary CEA at the Cleveland Clinic between 1983 and 1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The patients were identified from the Vascular Surgery Registry and were compared with 202 randomly selected patients 60 years of age and older (mean, 69.3 years; group II) who were frequency-matched by gender and the year of primary CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Carotid shunting was used routinely, and the arteriotomy was patched in the majority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed-up for mean of 47.2 months (group I) and 46.0 months (group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the indications for CEA (symptomatic CAS, 49% in group I vs 48% in group II) or the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary diseases</z:hpo>, and lower extremity <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Younger adults were more likely to have a history of smoking (93% vs 76%; p = 0.005), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (71% vs 52%; p = 0.006), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025322" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">premature menopause</z:e> (57% vs 18%; p &lt; 0.001) and had lower levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in the distribution of the operated artery occurred within 24 hours in one younger patient (1.8%) and in one older patient (0.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was attributed to early carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the young patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Major late postoperative neurologic complications were documented in one young patient (1.8%) and six older patients (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients in group I were at significantly higher risk for recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (risk ratio, 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 7.3; p = 0.010); younger individuals remained at significantly higher risk for recurrent stenosis even after adjusting for smoking and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (risk ratio, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.5 to 9.4; p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>By life-table analysis, younger adults tended to have a higher rate of late reoperations (p = 0.065) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CEA can be safely performed in young adults with premature CAS, although younger individuals appear to have higher rates of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> compared with older counterparts </plain></SENT>
