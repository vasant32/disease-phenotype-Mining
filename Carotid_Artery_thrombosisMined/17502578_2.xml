<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the accuracy of serial National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) scores to detect complete early recanalization of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from the CLOTBUST trial (Combined Lysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Thrombus</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain Ischemia</z:e> Using Transcranial Ultrasound and Systemic tPA) were used to determine the most sensitive and specific NIHSS-derived parameter to identify complete recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, reproducibility was tested against a separate patient population (Barcelona data set) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NIHSS scores were determined before tissue plasminogen activator bolus and at 60 and 120 minutes in both data sets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to compare test performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of individual cutoffs was demonstrated by sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 122 patients in the CLOTBUST data set and 98 in the Barcelona data set received 0.9 mg/kg intravenous tissue plasminogen activator [mean age 69+/-12 versus 72+/-12 years, 57% male versus 51% male, median NIHSS 16 versus 17 points, mean time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to treatment 140+/-32 versus 177+/-59 minutes, and complete recanalization of the middle cerebral artery in 19% versus 17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For identification of recanalization, an NIHSS score reduction of &gt; or = 40% offered the best tradeoff, with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 65%, 85%, 50%, and 91% at 60 minutes and 74%, 80%, 58%, and 89% at 120 minutes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Test performance was equal in the Barcelona data set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Relative changes in serial NIHSS scores can serve as a simple clinical indicator of arterial status after intravenous thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Accuracy parameters are affected by the process of recanalization and its varying clinical significance </plain></SENT>
