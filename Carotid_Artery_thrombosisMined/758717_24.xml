<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although remote bypass followed by complete removal of the infected prosthesis has proven to be a satisfactory method of treatment, in certain instances remote bypass alone is not feasible and other modes of surgical treatment must be employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report describes the use of autogenous reconstructions within the infected field, including endarterectomy and replacement of the infected graft with arterial or venous autografts in 24 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The key approach in these patients was (1) accurate preoperative assessment of the extent of graft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, (2) aggressive surgical efforts to remove <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> infected prosthetic material, and (3) autogenous reconstructions within the infected field to supply critical vascular beds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients died, for a mortality rate of 13% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and only two <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputations</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Suture lines involving autogenous tissue healed, even when in an infected field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the aortofemoral group, preservation of aortic continuity is very desirable, when possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We believe that these techniques provide the maximal potential for salvage of life and limb in the management of this dreaded vascular complication </plain></SENT>
