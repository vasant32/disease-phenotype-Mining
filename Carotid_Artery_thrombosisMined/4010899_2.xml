<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our adult Sprague-Dawley rats were killed by in vivo perfusion-fixation at 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 3 hours, 1 day, and 3 days after the completion of carotid endarterectomy, and vessels were studied by scanning electron microscopy, light microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy for evaluation of thrombotic changes at the level of arterial injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although no postoperative carotid occlusion was observed, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation was noted as early as 15 minutes after recirculation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microsurgical carotid endarterectomy in rats may be a useful experimental model for the evaluation of antithrombotic drugs </plain></SENT>
