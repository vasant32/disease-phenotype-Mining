<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since then, 250 cases have been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors report on 5 recent cases and on that occasion, they review the literature and discuss the different therapeutic possibilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This pathology can be envisaged when a middle-aged adult, free of any previous pathology or trauma, presents with latero-cervical pain followed by cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The angiographic findings are of three types: regular or irregular extensive stenosis, pseudo-aneurysmal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> followed by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> stenosis, funnel-like tapering of the vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The spontaneous course of such a dissection most often (80%) leads to an almost complete resolution of clinical and angiographic signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment, therefore, should essentially be based on <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and antiaggregant therapy, so as to prevent ischemic attacks or carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgical indications should remain exceptional </plain></SENT>
