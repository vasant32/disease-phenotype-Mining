<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>YM-254890 dose-dependently inhibited ex vivo <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-induced platelet aggregation after i.v. bolus injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> study, YM-254890 dosedependently prolonged time to occlusion at doses of 3 and 10 g/kg i.v. and decreased occlusion rate at 10 g/kg i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the thrombolysis study, YM-254890 at 30 micro g/kg i.v. shortened the time to reperfusion and prevented reocclusion after thrombolysis with a modified tissue-type plasminogen activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>YM-254890, at 10 micro g/kg and more, significantly improved carotid patency status after thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, at 30 micro g/kg and more, YM-254890 decreased systemic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that YM-254890 may be effective for treating G(q)-mediated diseases, and that YM-254890 is a useful tool for investigating the biological roles of G(q/11) </plain></SENT>
