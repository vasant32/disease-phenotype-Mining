<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-one consecutive patients (27 men; mean age 63.7+/-13.0 years, range 53- 81) underwent repeat endovascular intervention (balloon angioplasty and provisional stenting) for the treatment of 32 in-stent restenoses following CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Procedural success was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An additional stent was implanted in 10 (31%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No procedural complication was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Filter analysis was performed in 17 (53%) procedures; on 12 (71%), macroscopically visible material was captured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The histomorphometric analysis performed on 6 (19%) filters showed fibrin nets entrapping erythrocytes, leucocytes, platelets, and in 2 cases, fibrous hypercellular tissue fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 30 days and during follow-up (mean 17+/-5 months), no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 1 (3.1%) patient, asymptomatic recurrence of ISR was found on Doppler ultrasonography and successfully treated with balloon angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Repeat endovascular intervention using balloon angioplasty with provisional stenting and routine cerebral protection appears to be a feasible, safe, and clinically effective strategy for the treatment of in-stent restenosis after CAS </plain></SENT>
