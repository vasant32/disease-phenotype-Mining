<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, a recently developed model of carotid endarterectomy in rats was used to assess the effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, prostacyclin (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi>), and OKY-1581, a selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">TXA2</z:chebi>) synthetase inhibitor, in preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups: A--controls (no treatment), B--<z:chebi fb="3" ids="9754">tris</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24712">hydroxymethyl</z:chebi>) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16830">aminomethane</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="9754">Tris</z:chebi>)-HCl buffer (vehicle of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi>), C--<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (100 IU/kg), D--OKY-1581 (100 microns/kg/minute), E--low dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> (10 ng/kg/minute), F--high dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> (50 ng/kg/minute) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were killed by in vivo perfusion-fixation 15 minutes after recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The endarterectomized vessels were submitted to scanning electron microscopy examination and were evaluated blindly according to the following scale: 1, (almost) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearance of the endarterectomized surface; 2, moderately abnormal appearance; and 3, definitely abnormal appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results in terms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> prevention were as follows: controls congruent to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9754">Tris</z:chebi>-HCl buffer less than OKY-1581 congruent to low dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> less than high dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> less than <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When combined, the two control groups did significantly worse than <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four treated groups (P greater than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fisher's exact test showed a statistically significant difference between controls and the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> group (P = 0.01) and between controls and high dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi>-treated rats (P less than 0.05), but not between controls and low dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi>-(P less than 0.16) or OKY-1581-treated animals (P less than 0.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present study confirms that anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> is effective in reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation after carotid endarterectomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
