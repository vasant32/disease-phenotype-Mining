<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the enzyme kinetics, antithrombotic and antihaemostatic properties of BMS-593214, an active-site, direct FVIIa inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies were conducted in enzymatic assays, and in anesthetised rabbit models of electrically-induced carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (AT), thread-induced vena cava <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (VT) and cuticle <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time (BT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antithrombotic efficacy of BMS-593214 given intravenously was evaluated for both the prevention and treatment of AT and VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BMS-593214 displayed direct, competitive inhibition of human FVIIa in the hydrolysis of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47923">tripeptide</z:chebi> substrate with Ki of 5 nM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, it acted as a noncompetitive inhibitor of the activation of the physiological substrate FX by TF/VIIa with Ki of 9.3 nM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BMS-593214 showed selectivity for FVIIa and exhibited species differences in TF-FVIIa-dependent anticoagulation with similar potency in human and rabbit plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BMS-593214 was efficacious in the prevention and treatment models of AT and VT with ED50 values of 1.1 to 3.1 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, BMS-593214 exhibited a wide therapeutic window with respect to BT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that inhibition of FVIIa with small-molecule active-site inhibitors represents a promising antithrombotic approach for the development of new therapies for the prevention and treatment of AT and VT </plain></SENT>
