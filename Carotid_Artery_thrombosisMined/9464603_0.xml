<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this report is to consider the technical aspects of carotid eversion endarterectomy and reimplantation into the common carotid artery for surgical treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atherosclerotic occlusive disease</z:e>, in light of previous early and late results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the past 2 years, the authors have more frequently used carotid eversion endarterectomy and reimplantation to minimize the risk of perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusion-<z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and the incidence of early and late restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some 88 patients underwent 95 carotid eversion endarterectomies and reimplantation (seven bilateral): 59 internal carotid arteries were surgically corrected for ischaemic symptoms while 36 patients were symptomless but presented with a haemodynamically significant stenosis at the internal carotid artery bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ischaemic preoperative symptoms consisted of one or more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e>'s in 39 patients (66%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> in 15 (25%) and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in five (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Associated elongation of the internal carotid artery beyond the end of the plaque was present in 81 cases (85%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After freeing the internal carotid artery sufficiently beyond the distal limit of the lesion, the vessel was transected obliquely to its origin, the extramedial cleavage plane opened and the endarterectomized arterial wall everted beyond the natural end of the plaque, which was gently removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The artery was dilated distally and finally reimplanted end-to-side into the common carotid artery, 1-2 cm or more above the original site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This technique has provided excellent early and late results: no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>-occlusion, no minor or major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred perioperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No restenosis, no symptomless or symptomatic late occlusion was found during late follow-up (mean 28 (range 6-44) months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The performance of this vascular technique must be encouraged and recommended because of its speed, effectiveness and success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Carotid eversion endarterectomy and reimplantation should be performed routinely when the internal carotid artery is elongated </plain></SENT>
