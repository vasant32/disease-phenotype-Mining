<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a patient with an isolated central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> who was found to have an ipsilateral carotid dissection by neck computed tomographic scan, later confirmed by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported case of carotid dissection causing central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> without any other neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It demonstrates the diagnostic usefulness of computed tomographic imaging in such cases </plain></SENT>
