<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to assess the benefit of vein patching versus direct closure after carotid endarterectomy, a series of 2271 carotid operations were analysed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Apart from 114 procedures consisting of saphenous vein bypass (n = 29) and eversion endarterectomy (n = 85), 2157 open endarterectomies were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were closed either directly (n = 837) or using a vein patch (n = 1320) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The combined mortality-major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301721" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological morbidity</z:e> rate was 1.7%, i.e. 1% mortality (0.2% neurological) and 0.7% permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301721" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological morbidity</z:e> (0.5% ipsilateral to the operated artery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early symptomatic internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was documented in six cases (four following direct closure and two after vein patching) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 827 carotid arteries were followed up by duplex scanning on an annual basis (244 direct closure and 583 vein patching) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 44 months; 69 months for direct closure and 35 months for vein patching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In direct closure, there were 21 stenoses (9%) and 10 occult thromboses (4%); in vein patching carotids, there were 17 stenoses (3%), nine thromboses (1.8%) [corrected] and six pseudoaneurysms (1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Annual incidence of poor results was 2.4% in direct closure, and 0.87% in vein patching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The only other factor responsible for a significant difference was gender (3.4% in women versus 2.1% in men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this retrospective study, vein patching appears to be beneficial for the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and late stenosis or <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
