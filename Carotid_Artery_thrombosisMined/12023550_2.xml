<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intimatan (dermatan 4,6-di-O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi>) is a <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor II <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> that inhibits both free and bound forms of thrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study examines the hypothesis that Intimatan prevents thrombotic occlusion in response to vascular wall injury in a canine model of carotid artery/jugular vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The left carotid artery and right jugular vein served as vehicle-treated control vessels, whereas the right carotid artery and left jugular vein were subjected to electrolytic injury after administration of Intimatan (9 mg/kg bolus + 300 microg/kg/min infusion, i.v.) or dalteparin (Fragmin) (400 IU/kg, s.c.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intimatan significantly increased time to carotid artery (226.0 +/- 14.0 min) and jugular vein (240.0 +/- 0.0 min) <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, compared with control vessels (carotid artery, 87.1 +/- 7.9 min; jugular vein, 60.6 +/- 7.4 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vessel patency was maintained in eight of eight jugular veins and seven of eight carotid arteries during treatment with Intimatan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dalteparin significantly increased time to carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (122.1 +/- 17.5 min) compared with control (64.3 +/- 8.2 min), but did not change the time to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the jugular vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only one carotid artery remained patent at the end of the dalteparin protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The two drugs produced minimal increases in <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> times, and Intimatan increased the activated partial thromboplastin time above that observed with dalteparin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate that Intimatan is effective in preventing occlusive arterial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in an experimental model of deep vascular wall injury </plain></SENT>
