<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inthe group (82 patients) which was felt to have significant occlusive disease of internal carotid at the level of carotid bifurcation (smaller than 50 percent stenosis), the CCT showed a 92 per cent correlation with arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the group (48 patients) that underwent endarterectomy, there was a 94 per cent correlation with CCT testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 40 patients, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> arteriogram or with less than 50 percent stenotic lesions on arteriography, there was a larger number (25% of patients with a CCT test which appeared to indicate decreased flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Various reasons for this are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The high correlation of the CCT test and carotid arteriography in the patients with surgically amenable lesions would suggest that the CCT test is a good noninvasive screening technique for the detection of significant occlusive disease of the extracranialcarotid vascular system </plain></SENT>
