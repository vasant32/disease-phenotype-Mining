<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Equal doses (according to catalytically active CAT) were used to examine the effect of native CAT, CAT-CHS covalent conjugate and mixture of native CAT and free CHS in a ratio corresponding to their contents in the conjugate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antithrombotic activity of the derivatives was determined by the time during which <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> developed (occlusion time) and by the mass of the formed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The antithrombotic activities of the conjugate and mixture were similar and markedly higher than that of native CAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The conjugate was more effective with respect to deceleration and prevention of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Small doses of the preparations altered the structure of the formed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, promoting sustained blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further investigations of the antithrombotic activity of CAT, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase and CHS derivatives have been outlined </plain></SENT>
