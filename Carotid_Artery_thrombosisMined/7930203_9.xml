<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study attempted to determine the influence of progressive degrees of stenosis on platelet deposition onto a severely damaged vessel wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The severity of wall injury and increased shear forces have been proposed as the determinants of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation and growth in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Carotid angioplasty was performed in 15 mongrel dogs to produce severe wall damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group I (n = 9) had arteries with damage only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In group II (n = 14), progressive degrees of stenosis were produced at the center of the dilated area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation was evaluated by angiography at the time of angioplasty and platelet deposition/cm2 quantified by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">indium</z:chebi>-111 labeling 1 h after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Severe wall damage (group I) produced a significant increase in platelet deposition compared with control arterial segments (8.19 +/- 3.82 vs. 3.62 +/- 2.52 platelets x 10(6)/cm2 [mean +/- SD], p &lt; 0.05), and the presence of a stenosis (group II) further increased platelet deposition (36.98 +/- 3.82 platelets x 10(6)/cm2, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Angiographic filling defects or total occlusion was found in seven of the arteries in group II but in none in group I (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A shear rate of approximately 5,000 s-1, corresponding to a critical stenosis of 70% and a 1.5- to 1.6-mm diameter, was found to identify the arteries in which <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was likely to occur (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four of 5 arteries &lt; 1.5 to 1.6 mm in diameter had angiographic filling defects or occlusion compared with 1 of 13 with less severe stenosis (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In low shear rate conditions, deep arterial injury will lead to mural <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> without further <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When deep arterial injury occurs under critical local shear conditions, platelet deposition will be enhanced, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> may progress to total occlusion </plain></SENT>
