<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess whether patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (CAO) who have clinical features suggesting a haemodynamic origin have a poor haemodynamic or metabolic state of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 117 patients with ischaemic symptoms of the eye or brain that were transient or at most moderately disabling and associated with a CAO, we compared <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> reactivity, quantitative flow measurement by magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) angiography, metabolic ratios measured by (1)H-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy, collateral blood flow patterns and the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of the borderzone type between patients grouped by the following clinical features: (1) presence or absence of at least one of the 'classical' haemodynamic symptoms: limb <z:mp ids='MP_0000745'>shaking</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">claudication</z:e>, precipitation of symptoms by exercise, by rising from a sitting or lying position, by transition from a cold to a warm environment, or by documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, and (2) symptoms having occurred after demonstration of the CAO or only before the occlusion was documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with (n = 16) and without (n = 101) one of the 'classical' haemodynamic symptoms did not differ in any of the measured indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with recurrent symptoms after documentation of the CAO (n = 56) had lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> reactivity (difference 8.3%, 95% confidence interval 0.1-16.5) than those with symptoms only before documentation of the occlusion (n = 61), whereas no significant differences were found in any of the other measured indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> reactivity was no longer significant after adjustment for the interval between the patients' last symptoms and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> reactivity measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with CAO we could not find an association between symptoms that have been associated with hypoperfusion and a poor haemodynamic or metabolic state of the brain </plain></SENT>
