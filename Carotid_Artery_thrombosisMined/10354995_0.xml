<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Only a few clinical reports about the routine use of intravenous rt-PA for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> have been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Wether the perfusion of the extracranial parts of the internal carotid artery influences the outcome of the patients is still unknown, because the two major studies about systemic thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (ECASS and NINDS) did not formally assess the status of the extracranial vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 56 Patients were treated with intravenous rt-PA within 6 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> between January 1995 and May 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before and within 24 h after the thrombolytic therapy usually a neurovascular diagnostic with extra- und transcranial Doppler-ultrasound or CT-angiography was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Occlusions of the intracranial parts of the internal carotid artery (Carotid-T) were excluded from thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The outcome was assessed using the Rankin-scale at least 3 month after the therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to administration of treatment was 3.7 h.A parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> with clinical deterioration was found in four patients (7.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight patients died until the follow-up (14.3%), four within 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>39 patients showed a clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Outcome and recanalization rate of the medial cerebral artery was not influenced by stenoses or occlusions of the extracranial internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Routine intravenous use of rt-PA for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> shows safety comparable to the results of the NINDS study even in 6 h time window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The outcome and recanalization rate depends not on the perfusion of the extracranial parts of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
