<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the antithrombotic and thrombolytic effects of Trombovazim, a highly-purified proteolytic enzyme preparation obtained by immobilization of <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> proteinases (Bacillus) on <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53226,53227">polyethylene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> with a molecular weight of 1.5 kDa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood absorption of the preparation was evaluated after intragastric administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro experiments showed that Trombovazim produces <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and thrombolytic effects, which manifested in inhibition of fibrin clot formation and acceleration of its lysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Drug concentration in the blood was elevated from the 4th to the 7th hour after intragastric administration of Trombovazim in a dose of 2250 U/kg, being maximum by the 5th hour (0.044+/-0.011 U/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Course treatment with Trombovazim (1000 U intragastrically, twice daily for 3 days) had a thrombolytic effect on rats with experimental intravascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This effect was manifested in a decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> weight and increase in the percent of rats with recanalization of the occluded carotid artery </plain></SENT>
