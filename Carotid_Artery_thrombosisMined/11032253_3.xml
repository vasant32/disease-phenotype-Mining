<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report the endovascular treatment of a symptomatic extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> that was complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: After undergoing a coronary artery bypass graft procedure, a patient was diagnosed with a symptomatic, 3.5-cm ICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> by computed tomography and angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Via a semiclosed access, an Enduring vascular graft was inserted under controlled back <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> from the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient was recovering uneventfully when routine duplex scanning on the fifth postoperative day suggested multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> within the graft, which was confirmed by arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thrombectomy and local fibrinolysis were performed; however, the graft occluded the next day without causing neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was diagnosed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular repair of high cervical extracranial ICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> is feasible, and protection against intracerebral embolization can be achieved using a semiclosed technique with controlled back <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> from the ICA during endograft deployment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> or thrombotic occlusion during the postoperative period, particularly in a patient already sensitized to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, should direct attention toward possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
