<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In 60 patients with arteriographically confirmed changes in extracranial arteries EEG investigations were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 15 of them surgical interventions were performed for restoring the patency of the involved artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EEG curves were studied for finding abnormalities in cases of changes in definite groups of arteries (internal carotid, arteries of the aortic arch), and correlations were sought for between the extent of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and EEG curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the patients treated surgically EEG curves were compared before and after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The author concludes that changes limited to the internal carotid artery lying which is situated nearer to the head can produce larger foci of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> and greater intensity of EEG changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the surgically treated patients EEG records were improved after the operation in most cases, which shows that restoration of arterial patency exerts a favourable effect on the cerebral circulation evidenced in EEG improvement </plain></SENT>
