<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This enabled immediate reexploration of the involved artery with restoration of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This kind of examination is also safe, quick and highly accurate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors propose it as a substitute to intraoperative arteriography which is routinely performed by some surgeons after carotid thromboendoarterectomy </plain></SENT>
