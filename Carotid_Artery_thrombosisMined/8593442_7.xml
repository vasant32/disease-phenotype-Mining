<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the thrombolytic effect of nattokinase on a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the common carotid artery of rat in which the endothelial cells of the vessel wall were injured by <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When a section of occluded vessel was stained for CD61 antigen by immunofluorescence utilizing a monoclonal antibody, the antigen was localized around the surface of the occluded blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This result suggests that the occlusive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was caused by platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, thrombolysis with urokinase (UK; 50000 IU/kg, i.v.) or tissue plasminogen activator (tPA; 13300 IU/kg, i.v.) in our model was observed to restore the blood flow over a 60 min monitoring period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that our chemically induced model is useful for screening and evaluating a thrombolytic agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the thrombolytic activity of nattokinase using this model and compared it with fibrino(geno)lytic enzyme, plasmin or elastase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On a molar basis, the recovery of the arterial blood flow with nattokinase, plasmin and elastase were 62.0 +/- 5.3%, 15.8 +/- 0.7% and 0%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the thrombolytic activity of nattokinase is stronger than that of plasmin or elastase in vivo </plain></SENT>
