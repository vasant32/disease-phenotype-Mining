<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> reduces the clinical effectiveness of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Postoperative thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may be reduced in incidence by the use of transcranial Doppler-directed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran-40</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This programme requires the purchase of additional equipment and employment of more staff </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study examined whether this additional financial outlay was cost-effective in terms of saving expenditure by preventing postoperative thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: data was collected prospectively on a series of 600 consecutive CEAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The costs of the monitoring programme were analysed over 1- and 5-year periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Formulae were derived allowing other units to calculate whether this technique will be cost-effective for them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: after the introduction of TCD monitoring the postoperative thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate fell from 2.7% to 0% (8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> prevented) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our local unit cost for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 25,702 pounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After allowing for the additional costs of the monitoring programme, we calculate that postoperative TCD has saved 171,393 pounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: postoperative TCD monitoring is a clinically effective and also cost-effective method of reducing the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate associated with CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For units performing more than 50 CEAs per year who experience occasional postoperative carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, its introduction should be considered </plain></SENT>
