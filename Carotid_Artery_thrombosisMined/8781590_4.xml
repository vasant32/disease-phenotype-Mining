<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The true pathologic process of nearly or completely occluded lesions of the cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) has not been studied sufficiently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This information is important in determining the critical indications for endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> pathologic features of these advanced occlusive lesions of the ICA were studied in 40 patients who underwent emergency carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gross morphologic and histopathologic features of these occlusive lesions were examined, and the relationship between the clinical information and the pathologic characteristics was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-seven lesions had histologic features of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> complicated by fresh intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> with or without transintimal extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thinwalled neovessels were thought to be an important etiologic factor in producing intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining three lesions without these changes had strangulated embolic material at the occluded portion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A good correlation between these pathologic features and angiographic findings was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presented results clearly indicate that intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> is the most important factor in producing and determining the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> pathologic features of symptomatic and advanced atheromatous occlusive ICA lesions </plain></SENT>
