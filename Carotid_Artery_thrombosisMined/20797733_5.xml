<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Concerns have been raised about the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in patients having received <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, different indications for thrombolytic treatment are in use for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients on <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, it remains uncertain whether the prior <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> use actually increases their risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in patients treated with thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included 179 consecutive patients who had high-risk cardioembolic sources and received thrombolytic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated with intravenous thrombolytic agents, or underwent intraarterial thrombolysis if their international normalized ratio (INR) was ≤1.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We compared the frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications between patients with prior <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> use and those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also investigated whether there were differences in functional outcome and recanalization rates between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A prior <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> use was present in 28 patients (15.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although INR levels were higher in the prior <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> group, the frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications was not different between patients who received prior <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed in patients with or without prior <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> use, for successful recanalization rate (Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> grade 2 or 3), mortality, or modified Rankin score (≤2) at 3months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thrombolytic therapy for patients who previously received <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and had an INR≤1.7 did not affect <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> risk, clinical outcome, or recanalization rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that patients with a history of prior <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> use may be safely treated with thrombolytic agents when their INR levels are low </plain></SENT>
