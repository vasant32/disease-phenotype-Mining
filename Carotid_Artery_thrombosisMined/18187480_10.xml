<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 20 symptomatic and 20 asymptomatic patients, with at least 50% <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> as determined by Doppler ultrasound, underwent preoperative in vivo multispectral MRI of the carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies were analysed both qualitatively and quantitatively in a randomised manner by two experienced readers in consensus, blinded to clinical status, and plaques were classified according to the modified American Heart Association (<z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHA</z:chebi>) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After exclusion of poor quality images, 109 MRI sections in 18 symptomatic and 19 asymptomatic patients were available for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in mean <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> stenosis severity (72.9% vs 67.6%; p = 0.09) or plaque burden (median plaque areas 50 mm(2) vs 50 mm(2); p = 0.858) between the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, symptomatic lesions had a higher incidence of ruptured fibrous caps (36.5% vs 8.7%; p = 0.004), haemorrhage or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> (46.5% vs 14.0%; p&lt;0.001), large necrotic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> cores (63.8% vs 28.0%; p = 0.002) and complicated type VI <z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHA</z:chebi> lesions (61.5% vs 28.1%; p = 0.001) compared with asymptomatic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The MRI findings of plaque haemorrhage or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> had an odds ratio of 5.25 (95% CI 2.08 to 13.24) while thin or ruptured fibrous cap (as opposed to a thick fibrous cap) had an odds ratio of 7.94 (95% CI 2.93 to 21.51) for prediction of symptomatic clinical status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in plaque characteristics between symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid atheroma and these can be detected in vivo by high resolution MRI </plain></SENT>
