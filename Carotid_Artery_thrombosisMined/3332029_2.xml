<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The paper discusses the application of the Wigner transform to the estimation of blood velocity from the Doppler signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A new type of Wigner transform, the Zoom Wigner Transform or ZWT is developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ZWT has certain advantages over the standard Wigner transform, particularly in relation to the frequency resolution of specific components, these are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The final section of the paper considers practical aspects of blood velocity estimation and illustrates the use of the WZT in relation to other methods </plain></SENT>
