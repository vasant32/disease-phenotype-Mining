<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Identifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormalities</z:hpo> in patients with combined <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> history is clinically challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to probe the complexity of dysregulated coagulation in humans by characterizing pathophysiologic mechanisms in a patient with both <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of haematomas, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001058'>poor wound healing</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917805,C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient cerebral ischaemia</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> activated partial thromboplastin time, prolonged thrombin and reptilase times, and decreased functional and antigenic fibrinogen levels, and was initially diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0472803" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypodysfibrinogenaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This diagnosis was supported by DNA analysis revealing a novel FGB mutation (c.656A&gt;G) predicting a Q189R mutation in the mature chain that was present in the heterozygote state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, turbidity analysis showed that purified fibrinogen polymerisation and degradation were indistinguishable from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and BÎ² chain subpopulations appeared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> by two-dimensional difference in-gel electrophoresis, indicating the mutated chain was not secreted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, plasma thrombin generation testing revealed the patient's thrombin generation was higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and could be attributed to elevated levels of factor VIII (FVIII, 163-225%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, in an arterial injury model, hypofibrinogenaemic mice (Fgn(+/-)) infused with factor VIII demonstrated significantly shorter vessel occlusion times than saline-infused Fgn(+/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together, these data associate the complex <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and thrombotic presentation with combined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0553681" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypofibrinogenaemia</z:e> plus plasma <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest previous cases in which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1305332" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fibrinogen abnormalities</z:e> have been associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> may also be complicated by co-existing plasma <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> and illustrate the importance of "global" coagulation testing in patients with compound presentations </plain></SENT>
