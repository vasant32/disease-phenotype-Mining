<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The recombinant protein SAK-RGD-K2-Hir is characterized by its fibrin-specific properties of plasminogen activation combined with antithrombin and antiplatelet activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was previously shown in our in-vitro studies to be a more potent and faster-acting thrombolytic agent compared with standard r-SAK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to document the effects of the thrombolytic potential of SAK-RGD-K2-Hir we examined this protein in an electrically induced carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model and stasis-induced venous model in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> model, a bolus injection of SAK-RGD-K2-Hir was less effective than rt-PA and r-SAK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the most effective in the improvement and maintenance of carotid patency and in arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> mass reduction was SAK-RGD-K2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> r-SAK derivatives reduced venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> weight significantly in comparison to r-SAK and r-Hir </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the most observable decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> weight was obtained after application of recombinant proteins containing the r-Hir </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time was significantly prolonged in the animals treated with proteins containing r-Hir at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no observable changes in plasma fibrinogen concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our findings show thrombolytic activity in intravenous bolus injection of the novel thrombolytic agent SAK-RGD-K2-Hir in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although this protein compares favourably with r-SAK in rat venous thrombolysis, we were unable to confirm the beneficial effects of SAK-RGD-K2-Hir over r-SAK and rt-PA in the carotid artery thrombolysis model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our results also suggest that SAK-RGD-K2-Hir bears a risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, but this may be true for higher doses </plain></SENT>
