<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hour to 180 days afterward, the cell renewal in the arterial wall was studied by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53526">tritiated thymidine</z:chebi> autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An increased number of labeled cells were observed, especially in the early developmental phase of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and mainly in the tunica media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings seem to accord best with the hypothesis that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> are mainly organized by smooth muscle cells from the tunica media, which are partly dedifferentiated toward fibroblast-like cells </plain></SENT>
