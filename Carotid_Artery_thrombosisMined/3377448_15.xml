<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a new model of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the rat, based on endothelial disruption and platelet aggregation in the carotid artery, which leads to distal embolization and focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The common carotid artery was irradiated for 6.5 minutes with the focused beam of an <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> laser operated at a wavelength of 514.5 nm with a peak power of 2 W and an average power of 400 mw </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ipsilateral cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, ranging in size from 0.1 to 1.7 mm, were produced by platelet emboli in 12 of 13 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 44 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were observed in the 12 rats: 29 in the cortex, 6 in the hippocampus, 5 in the thalamus, and 4 in the basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Scanning electron microscopy identified platelet aggregates in the carotid artery and in a deep cortical arteriole 50 minutes after the photochemical lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after the experiment, scanning electron microscopy of the carotid artery revealed damaged endothelium but few remaining adherent platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More intense laser irradiation in 8 rats, leading to carotid occlusion, produced an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in only 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This new model can be used to study the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> pathological changes in the brain associated with platelet embolism </plain></SENT>
