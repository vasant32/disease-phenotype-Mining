<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In pilot studies designed to identify pharmacologic approaches capable of diminishing such increases, we found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5296">gemfibrozil</z:chebi> attenuated the stimulation of synthesis of PAI-1 in a human, immortal, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019204" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatoma</z:e> cell line (Hep G2) induced by platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was performed to determine whether it exerts analogous effects in non-immortal endothelial cells and whether it may therefore facilitate fibrinolysis locally in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were incubated with pharmacologic concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5296">gemfibrozil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="5296">Gemfibrozil</z:chebi>, 100 microM, suppressed basal PAI-1 production by 15% and attenuated the augmentation of synthesis of PAI-1 induced by lysates from platelets (4 x 10(7)/ml) by 36% over 24 h without inhibiting overall protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the increases in PAI-1 mRNA otherwise induced by platelet lysates over 6 h were suppressed by 49% (Northern blots) without any demonstrable change in the intracellular half-life of PAI-1 mRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated diminution of PAI-1 protein synthesis in parallel with the changes observed in PAI-1 mRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To determine whether these effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5296">gemfibrozil</z:chebi> on endothelial cells in vitro were paralleled by consistent changes in the concentrations of PAI-1 in plasma in vivo, we studied rabbits with induced carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and thrombolysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
