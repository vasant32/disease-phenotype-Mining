<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A signaling pathway is difficult, if not impossible, to elucidate in platelets using only in vivo studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Likewise, the physiological significance of signaling information obtained exclusively from in vitro observations is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, both in vitro and in vivo experiments are required to establish the physiological significance of a signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the physiological significance of signaling data obtained from botrocetin (bt)/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (VWF)-stimulated washed platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Stable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in response to FeCl(3)-induced injury of the mouse carotid artery was used to evaluate the physiological significance of signaling data obtained from bt/VWF-stimulated washed platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Syk, PLCgamma2, Galphaq and P2Y12, but not LAT, were found either to be required for or to affect stable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prior in vitro studies had demonstrated that LAT is not required for bt/VWF-induced platelet aggregation in the presence of exogenous fibrinogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data provide the first demonstration of the in vivo role for these signaling molecules in GPIb-dependent/initiated signal transduction and are consistent with the signaling pathway deduced from in vitro studies of bt/VWF-stimulated washed platelets using metabolic inhibitors and knockout mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The broad agreement between the in vitro and the in vivo results establish that bt/VWF stimulation of washed platelets can provide physiologically significant <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> Ib-dependent/initiated signaling data </plain></SENT>
