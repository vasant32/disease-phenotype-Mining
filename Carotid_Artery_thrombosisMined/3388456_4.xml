<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The right common carotid artery of rats was photothrombosed using a dye/light insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were given the photosensitizing dye <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> and irradiated for 4 minutes with an <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> laser beam focused onto the exposed common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the irradiation, 3 ml of blood was taken from the right external carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 10 minutes, the blood was infused into the external carotid artery of a recipient rat that had received horseradish peroxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen minutes after blood infusion, bilateral peroxidase extravasation was noted within cortical and subcortical areas of recipient rats, being most intense ipsilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural studies demonstrated peroxidase reaction product within numerous endothelial vesicles of arteriolar segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Infusion of blood from control rats did not produce similar changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, photoinduced vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of a large feeding artery leads to the formation of blood-borne factors that acutely alter cerebral vascular permeability </plain></SENT>
