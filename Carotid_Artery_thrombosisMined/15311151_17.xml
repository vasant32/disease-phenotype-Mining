<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45713">trans-resveratrol</z:chebi> (t-RES) administered as an ingredient of the diet on the atherothrombotic tendency was assessed in genetically hypercholesterolemic mice after laser-induced damage on endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mice lacking both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> receptor (apoE-/-/LDLR-/-) were fed with a high-fat diet with or without t-RES (9.6 and 96 mg/kg diet) for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The atherosclerotic tendency was morphometrically analyzed in their aortae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The thrombotic tendency was determined by inducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> by the irradiation of a <z:chebi fb="64" ids="30217">helium</z:chebi>-neon laser on carotid arteries of these mice with injection of Evans blue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Atherosclerotic area and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> size were evaluated by image analyzing in a computer system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Even though the plasma concentrations of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> (total cholesterol and triacylglycerol) did not change in the control and t-RES groups, a significant decrease (approximately 30%) in the formation of atheroma was observed in the aortae of the t-RES group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The size of laser-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> that mostly consisted of platelet aggregates was significantly reduced (approximately 25%) in the t-RES group compared with that in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, t-RES orally administrated with a high-fat diet in apoE-/-/LDLR-/- mice significantly suppressed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in their aortae and reduced the laser-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in their carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
