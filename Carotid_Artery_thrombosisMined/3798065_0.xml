<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe the case of a 32-year-old man who, shortly after an intensive practice match, presented symptoms consistent with cerebral damage which resulted in his <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within three days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main pathological findings were confined to the left internal carotid artery, which presented a dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> as a result of rupture of its intima with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of its lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> extended as far as the intracranial portion of the artery, resulting in massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> as cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there were histological modifications of both main carotid arteries and their branches which suggested repeated microtraumatic events </plain></SENT>
