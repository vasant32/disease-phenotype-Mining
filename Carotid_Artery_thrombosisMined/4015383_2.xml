<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We reviewed 326 carotid endarterectomies performed from 1960 through 1981 and encountered five instances of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical decompensation occurs with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> of severe neurologic deficits, most characteristically dense <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegias</z:hpo> contralateral to the side that has been operated on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These deficits developed between two and 72 hours postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prompt reoperation with thrombectomy and reestablishment of carotid flow within two hours from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the neurologic deficit was performed on four patients with complete resolution of the deficits in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The fourth patient recovered from a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> but retained a slight residual <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of the hand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The one patient whose condition did not improve underwent thrombectomy more than 24 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of her deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Time-consuming diagnostic procedures are not warranted as the success of reoperation depends on rapid reestablishment of cerebral flow </plain></SENT>
