<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thrombin plays an important role in promoting <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> by platelet activation and by catalyzing fibrin formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Use of thrombin inhibitors that block both the platelet-activating and fibrin formation properties of thrombin are associated with hemostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This problem might be overcome by developing agents that block only the platelet-activating property of thrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because the platelet-activating property of thrombin is mediated by the thrombin receptor, <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> of the thrombin receptor might be efficacious and potentially safer with regard to <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> ligand (AFLARAA) of the thrombin receptor that blocked alpha-thrombin and thrombin receptor activating <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-induced platelet aggregation could inhibit <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A partially occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was generated by application of electric current in rabbit carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In control animals, the artery was completely occluded within 42+/-12 min after the current was discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the thrombin receptor activating <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> was given (100 micromol/kg as an IV bolus followed by 900 micromol/kg infusion for a period of 180 min) starting at the time the current was stopped, blood flow remained patent throughout the infusion period and for an additional 60 min after the infusion was stopped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The antithrombotic effect of the <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was not associated with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001892'>bleeding tendency</z:hpo>, as judged by the amount of blood adsorbed by a gauze pad placed in a surgical incision extending to the muscle tissue and by a standard template <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that thrombin receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> can be used as antithrombotic agents </plain></SENT>
