<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using the autopsy cases with this disease (28 cases), we examined the histological details of the cerebral arteries, including the circle of Willis and its major branches, to describe the distribution and the nature of thrombotic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic lesions were observed in up to 15 out of the 28 cases (54%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Predominant sites of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were the internal carotid arteries, the posterior communicating arteries, and the posterior cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The high incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> formation as well as their distribution which closely correlated with the progression of the intimal lesion of this disease strongly suggested the importance of abnormal thrombogenesis as an etiologic factor in this disease </plain></SENT>
