<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of carotid artery stenting (CAS) in high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been shown to be more effective than medical therapy but has limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CAS may be a reasonable alternative, particularly in high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors evaluated prospectively the safety and efficacy of CAS in 299 consecutive patients who underwent CAS of 343 extracranial carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the patients enrolled, 210 (70%) would have been excluded from the major trials of CEA, and 84 (28%) were referred by vascular surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This series represents a very high-risk group that included patients with unstable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>, previous ipsilateral CEA, contralateral carotid occlusion, and other severe comorbid illnesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventy-four (25%) patients were aged 80 years or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had independent neurologic examination before and after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three hundred seventy-six stents were deployed in 343 arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Procedural success was 99% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean stenosis was 75 +/- 12% before and 7 +/- 8% after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ninety-two patients had coronary intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only 56 (19%) patients were North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During the initial hospitalization and 30 days post-CAS, there were two (0.6%) major and seven (2.3%) minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> during or within 30 days of CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>None of the NASCET-eligible patients had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>At a mean follow-up period of 26 +/- 13 months, eight (2.7%) patients had asymptomatic restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>No additional major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> or neurologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, CAS is feasible, can be performed even in high-risk patients, and is associated with a low restenosis rate </plain></SENT>
