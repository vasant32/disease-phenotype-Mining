<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There remains a dilemma whether or not to re-explore the carotid artery when a neurological complication occurs after carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study reviewed the indications for, findings and clinical outcomes following re-exploration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients who experienced transient or permanent neurological events following carotid endarterectomy were identified from a prospectively compiled computerized database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case notes were retrieved to determine time to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms, use of carotid artery imaging and details about patients who had surgical re-exploration, and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Some 780 consecutive carotid endarterectomies were performed over 16 years, with an incidence of major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of 2.3 per cent (18 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one patients experienced transient or permanent neurological events following surgery, 25 of whom underwent re-exploration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings included carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (ten patients), flap or other technical cause (three), haematoma (two) and no abnormality (ten) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neurological outcome after 30 days was similar, whether or not the carotid artery was re-explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Carotid artery re-exploration was undertaken in approximately half of the patients who developed neurological complications following carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the cause was identified and a secondary procedure was undertaken in 14 of 25 patients, there was no improvement in clinical outcome at 30 days compared with that of patients managed non-operatively </plain></SENT>
