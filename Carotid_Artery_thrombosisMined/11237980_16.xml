<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> complicated by ipsilateral carotid occlusion may present both mechanical and inflow-related barriers to effective intracranial thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to review our experience with a novel method of mechanical thrombectomy, in such cases, using the Possis AngioJet system, a rheolytic thrombectomy device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A review of our interventional neuroradiology database revealed three patients in whom an occluded cervical internal carotid artery was encountered during endovascular treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and in whom thrombectomy was attempted, using the 5F Possis AngioJet thrombectomy catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The medical records and radiographic studies of these patients were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three patients were identified (ages, 52--84 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients had isolated occlusion of the internal carotid artery; in one patient, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> extended down into the common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment was initiated within 190 to 360 minutes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thrombectomy of the carotid artery was deemed necessary because of poor collateral flow to the affected hemisphere (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> [one patient] and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> extending to the carotid "T" [one patient]) or inability to pass a microcatheter through the occluded vessel (one patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adjunctive therapy included pharmacologic thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients), carotid angioplasty and stenting (two patients), and middle cerebral artery angioplasty (one patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patency of the carotid artery was reestablished in two patients, with some residual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the third patient, the device was able to create a channel through the column of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, allowing intracranial access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Rheolytic thrombectomy shows potential for rapid, large-burden <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> removal in cases of internal carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, allowing expedient access to the intracranial circulation for additional thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
