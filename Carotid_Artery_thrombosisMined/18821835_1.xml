<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Endovascular treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> is a rapidly developing field that appears to hold great promise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Young patients may be particularly suited to benefit from endovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors sought to identify outcomes in young patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> who underwent endovascular intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed a prospectively collected endovascular intervention registry of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> treated at a single large-volume institution between December 2000 and June 2007 to identify patients 18-35 years of age who were treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data are presented as the mean +/- standard deviation unless otherwise noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven young patients underwent 8 consecutive endovascular interventions for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> (mean age 26 +/- 6 years; 5 women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score at presentation was 13 +/- 4.3 (median 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presented within 6 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Revascularization was attempted with mechanical thrombectomy/disruption, intraarterial thrombolysis, and/or angioplasty, with or without stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at discharge was 2.2 +/- 1.5 (median 1.5), with 5 patients (62.5%) achieving independence at discharge (mRS Score 0-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hospital length of stay was 6.5 +/- 3.7 days (4.4 +/- 1.5 days for patients with an mRS score of 0-2; 10 +/- 3.6 days for patients with an mRS score of 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients became independent and had reached an mRS score of &lt; or = 2 at last follow-up evaluation (29 +/- 25 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrate the relative safety of endovascular intervention in young patients with thromboembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and may suggest a potential benefit in outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further investigation is indicated with larger numbers of patients and an appropriate control population </plain></SENT>
