<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats including the controls receiving vehicle injection were perfused at 5 hours, and 1, 3 and 7 days post-operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The brains were removed and processed for immunohistochemistry using a panel of monoclonal antibodies: OX-42, OX-18 and OX-6 for labeling of microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In rats given saline injection OX-42 immunoreactive microglial cells were observed to be distributed quite evenly throughout the whole brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When injection of clot suspension was given, microglial cells responded vigorously, particularly in the ipsilateral hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microglial reaction was also detected in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex, caudate as well as septal nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of the detected reactive microglial cells were hypertrophied showing thick or stout processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some rod-like and amoeboid microglia were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rarely did the reactive microglia express OX-6 immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> microglial cells were unreactive for OX-18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The actual mechanisms leading to the microglial activation as well as functions of reactive microglia in focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> remain speculative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the absence of direct evidence, it could only be suggested that they may act as sensor cells for detection of subtle alterations in the microenvironment, probably in response to focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and/or leakage of serum-derived factors induced by thrombo-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
