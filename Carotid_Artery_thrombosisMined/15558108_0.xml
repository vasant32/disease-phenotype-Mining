<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, 20 years before, Egas Moniz, following the research work which lead to the discovery of cerebral angiography, had already mentioned and demonstrated such relationship, and published their observations in the portuguese, spanish and french medical literatures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As he did not published his works in the english literature, he did not get credit nor recognition on the fact, that was later developed by Miller Fisher who dedicated extensive contribution and divulgation on the subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present paper is dedicated to an historical review of the pionier work of Egas Moniz and co-workers, aimed to a better understanding of the pathogenic relationship between internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
