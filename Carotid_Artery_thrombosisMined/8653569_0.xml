<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The management of patients with coexisting severe carotid and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> continues to be controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the actual risks we have reviewed our experience of 92 patients that underwent simultaneous cardiac surgery and carotid thrombendarterectomy (<z:chebi fb="29" ids="28621,35026">TEA</z:chebi>) over a 10 year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 65 +/- 7 year (41-80), 75% were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 11 REDO cardiac procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 15 symptomatic and 77 asymptomatic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, including 21 with bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean preop.LVEF was 57.4% (15-80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Carotid <z:chebi fb="29" ids="28621,35026">TEA</z:chebi> was performed under <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (26 degrees C), preferably with beating heart after an equilibration period of 10 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall mortality was 5.4% (5 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>4 of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were reoperative cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Non-fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> occurred in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postop. neurological complications were diagnosed in 7 patients (8%), 3 transient and 4 permanent neurological deficits occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>33 patients had no post-operative complications at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> and 25 patients had as only complication, transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Follow-up revealed a 5-year survival rate of 83% and a cardiac event-free survival of 70%, without neurological events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We therefore conclude that simultaneous carotid <z:chebi fb="29" ids="28621,35026">TEA</z:chebi> and cardiac surgery can be performed using controlled hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (26 degrees C), in experienced hands, with an acceptable mortality (5.4%) and low morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Carotid <z:chebi fb="29" ids="28621,35026">TEA</z:chebi> combined with two or more cardiac procedures has the highest mortality and morbidity and should be avoided </plain></SENT>
