<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the rate of emboli (ER), as detected with transcranial Doppler scan (TCD) monitoring during and shortly after carotid endarterectomy (CEA), and early cerebrovascular complications (CVC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods: One-hunderd eighty-five consecutive patients underwent 203 CEAs with general anesthesia at the Sint Lucas Andreas Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria included adequate TCD monitoring during the operation and for at least 10 minutes in the recovery room </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients were excluded because of inadequate TCD monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To prevent statistical bias, only data from the first operation of those patients who underwent bilateral CEA were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study group thus consisted of 170 patients (113 men, 57 women) with a mean age of 67 years (range, 45 to 83 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The monitored TCD signals were stored on tape for offline analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ERs during dissection, wound closure, and the postoperative period shortly after arrival in the recovery room were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preoperative and early postoperative neurologic examination, including grading with the modified Rankin scale, was performed by the same board-certified neurologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A CVC occurred in 10 patients (5.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (2.9%) and three major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (1.8%) occurred, one with a fatal outcome (0.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients (1.2%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Median ERs for the three periods studied were significantly different (postoperative period, 0.3/min; dissection, 0.03/min; wound closure: 0/min; Friedman, P &lt;.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>ERs were significantly higher in the CVC group but only during wound closure (P =.0003) and the postoperative period (P &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Women had significantly more CVCs than men (14% versus 2.7%; P &lt;.02) and, during the postoperative period, had a significantly higher median ER (0.70/min) than men (0.25/min) (P &lt;.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>High ERs during dissection in two men were associated with CVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>An ER of 0.9/min or more during the postoperative period was significantly correlated with CVC (P &lt;.0001; odds ratio, 64.6; 95% CI, 3.7 to 1128) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Especially during the postoperative period, high ER is associated with early CVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Women have a higher ER than men in this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>If the ER is 0.9/min or more during the postoperative period, there appears to be at least a nearly four-fold increased risk of CVC </plain></SENT>
