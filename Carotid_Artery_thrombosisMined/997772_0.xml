<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mural <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was obtained at each of the intimal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, obstructive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> occurred in three instances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further investigation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> revealed that partial fragmentation occurred when exposed to hydrodynamic forces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that mural <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> following carotid endarterectomy in humans, is possibly more frequent and significant than it is generally appreciated, thus leading to the consideration of postoperative anticoagulation after endarterectomy, as a means to minimize the incidence of postoperative embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
