<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Platelet activating factor (PAF) is a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> released upon stimulation by a variety of cells and has been implicated in several pathophysiological events such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, although the ability to aggregate platelets in vitro was the first biological activity ascribed to PAF, its role in contributing to the in vivo formation of arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> has not been thoroughly clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Intravascular platelet aggregation was initiated in two different animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> and endothelial injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An external constrictor was positioned around rabbit carotid arteries and canine coronary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After placement of the constrictor, a typical pattern of flow developed in the stenotic vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This pattern of flow, characterized by progressive reductions of carotid or coronary blood flow followed by spontaneous or induced restorations of flow (cyclic flow variations, CFVs), is related to recurrent platelet aggregation at the site of the stenosis followed by dislodgment of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After observing CFVs for 30 minutes, BN52021 (up to 1.2 mg/kg), a potent and selective PAF <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, was given intravenously to rabbits (n = 12) and dogs (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BN52021 completely inhibited CFVs in 10 of 12 rabbits, whereas it was relatively ineffective in abolishing CFVs in dogs (only 2 of 10 animals inhibited) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This different effect of BN52021 was not explained by too small a dose of the drug to achieve a complete blockade of PAF receptors in dogs, since ex vivo platelet aggregation was completely inhibited in both rabbits and dogs in response to exogenous PAF at concentrations up to 10(-5) mol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a second group of 10 dogs, the hypothesis that PAF may become an important mediator of CFVs in dogs only several hours after endothelial injury was tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After 30 minutes of baseline CFVs, these animals received a bolus of BN52021 up to 1.2 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After this treatment, CFVs were completely abolished in 2 of 10 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The remaining 8 dogs were followed for an additional 8-hour period, at the end of which a second bolus of BN52021 was given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At this time, BN52021 was effective, as CFVs were abolished in 6 of 8 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These effects of BN52021 at 8 hours were not the consequence of a cumulative dose of the compound, since ex vivo platelet aggregation in response to PAF returned to baseline values immediately before administering the second dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>To identify possible sources of PAF other than aggregating platelets at the site of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo>, dogs in a third group were killed after 30 minutes (n = 7) and after 8 hours (n = 8) of CFVs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Histological sections of the stenotic coronary artery showed a marked <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> in these arterial segments after 8 hours of CFVs, whereas sections from dogs killed after 30 minutes showed only moderate or no infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that PAF plays an important role as a mediator of platelet aggregation in vivo in rabbits and dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In the canine model, PAF appears to become more important after <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> of the arterial wall, as it may contribute to initiating enough platelet activation to lead to cyclic flow variations at sites of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> and endothelial injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Data from the present study suggest that PAF <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> may be used as antiplatelet agents </plain></SENT>
