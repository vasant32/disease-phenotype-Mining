<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He had a history of left <z:hpo ids='HP_0007626'>mandibular osteomyelitis</z:hpo> that had been treated for five years in the dental department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002754'>osteomyelitis</z:hpo> was resistant to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two months before this admission, he had an infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the left extracranial carotid artery with occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On admission, the ESR was 140 mm/hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>P-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> and antinuclear antibody were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lumbar puncture revealed elevated cell counts (43% neutrophils) and protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microbiological studies were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images showed an enhanced lesion in the left cavernous sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>His condition gradually improved with high dose of <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">penicillin</z:chebi> and low dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, he died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> after 81 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At autopsy, the left extracranial carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was highly fibrose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The left CCA, ICA, and ECA were occluded from the origin of the left common carotid artery to the ICA in the cavernous sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were also <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, hemosiderin, and macrophages around these arteries, and parts of these arteries were destroyed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The left cavernous sinus lesion was also highly fibrose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These pathological findings indicated that there was old <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> around the left extracranial carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, left carotid artery, and left cavernous sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We believe that the left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271347" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cavernous sinus syndrome</z:e> in our patient was caused by left carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> induced by the left infectious extracranial carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>We also believe that this infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was caused by the left <z:hpo ids='HP_0007626'>mandibular osteomyelitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
