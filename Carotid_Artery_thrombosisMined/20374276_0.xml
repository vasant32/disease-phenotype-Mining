<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is determined by evaluating cerebral vasomotor reactivity (VMR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed VMR in asymptomatic patients with total occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and followed them to evaluate the role of impaired VMR in predicting ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (IS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-five patients (21 men, mean age ± SD 68 ± 7.5 years) with unilateral asymptomatic ICA occlusion were studied by transcranial Doppler and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690,31163">Diamox</z:chebi> test (intravenous 1.0 g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>) and followed for 48 months or until reaching the end-points of IS, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e>, or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VMR% was evaluated by recording the percent differences in peak systolic blood flow velocities in each middle cerebral artery at baseline and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690,31163">Diamox</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Based on VMR% calculations, 14 (40%) patients had good VMRs and 21 (60%) had impaired VMRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The global annual risk of ipsilateral ischaemic events was 5.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The annual ipsilateral ischaemic event risk was 1.8% in patients with good VMRs, whilst it was 7.1% in patients with impaired VMRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An impaired VMR was significantly correlated with ipsilateral IS (Kaplan-Meier log rank statistic, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the value of VMR assessment for identifying asymptomatic patients with carotid occlusion who belong to a high-risk subgroup for IS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>New trials using extracranial-to-intracranial bypass surgery in patients with asymptomatic ICA occlusion and impaired VMRs are warranted </plain></SENT>
