<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the manner and mechanism by which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8772">raloxifene</z:chebi> affect homeostatic pathways in ovariectomized mice after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> arterial injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Female mice (3 weeks old) underwent ovariectomy or sham operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five days after surgery, mice were assigned to treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> (5.3 nmol/kg), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8772">raloxifene</z:chebi> (2.7 micromol/kg), or placebo (n = 10-12/group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The biological effects of both treatments were assessed by measurements of bone mass and the degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0004894'>uterine atrophy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 4 months of therapy, carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was induced by photochemical injury, and the time to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both treatments <z:hpo ids='HP_0011001'>increased bone mineral density</z:hpo> (4.1%-7.85%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reversal of macroscopic <z:mp ids='MP_0004894'>uterine atrophy</z:mp> was observed only in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ovariectomized mice had a shorter time to occlusion compared with sham-operated mice (70.8 +/- 7.4 vs 103 +/- 11.3 min), suggesting accelerated <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8772">raloxifene</z:chebi> significantly inhibited intra-<z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in ovariectomized mice, prolonging the time to occlusion to 136.33 +/- 13.5 and 141.43 +/- 9.26 min, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cyclooxygenase-2 levels in the lung tissue were significantly increased by both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8772">raloxifene</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> with endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase expression being unaltered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> (measured by surface coverage under a shear rate of 1,800 s for 2 min) was significantly reduced in ovariectomized animals, being 4.63% +/- 1.47%, 5.78% +/- 1.58%, and 10.04% +/- 1.33% for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8772">raloxifene</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi>, and placebo, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ovariectomy amplifies <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We found that 4 months of treatment with both <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8772">raloxifene</z:chebi> attenuates intravascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The antithrombotic effect was accompanied by increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and suppression of platelet surface <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
