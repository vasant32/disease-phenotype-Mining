<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Vascular reconstruction was attempted in 109 patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The follow-up on those with restored or improved flow was as long as nine years (average: two and one-half years).Arteriographic demonstration of lesions is mandatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Complications were reduced by pre-arteriographic administration of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> and retrograde brachial arteriographic techniques.Although patients with stenosis are the best candidates, an attempt to restore flow in occluded vessels is warranted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, except those with advanced disease or those who are drowsy and hemiplegic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow was restored in two-thirds of those who underwent early operation (under three days) and in one-quarter of those undergoing late operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Even late operation restored flow in five of nine patients who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>.IN COMPLETED STROKES, OPERATION SHOULD BE LIMITED TO PATIENTS WITH: (1) minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, (2) extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> of short duration, and (3) extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> of longer duration but with a worth-while outlook.When flow was restored or improved, symptoms were arrested in 93% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e>, and at follow-up this result was maintained in 86% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Symptoms were arrested in 83% of those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in evolution, and this was maintained at follow-up.Reconstruction combined with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy of limited duration appears to be the optimal method of treatment </plain></SENT>
