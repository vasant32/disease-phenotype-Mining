<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The patency of the external carotid artery (ECA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) in the presence of an occlusion of the common carotid artery (CCA) was evaluated in 7 patients with a symptomatic CCA occlusion by the combined application of cerebrovascular Doppler examination (cv-Doppler) based on continuous-wave equipment and sequential computertomographic scans with intravenous bolus injection of contrast material (sequential CT-scans) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Occlusion of the CCA was demonstrated by cv- Doppler and sequential CT-scans and confirmed by routine angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A patent ECA was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7 patients by the combined method, but could not be demonstrated by routine angiography in one of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A patent ICA was found in 2 patients by the combined method, while routine angiographic findings concerning the patency of the ICA were equivocal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An occluded ICA was found in 5 patients by the cv-Doppler-sequential CT-scans method, where routine angiographic findings also were equivocal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Operation to restore blood flow in the CCA was performed in 5 patients and successful in 3 patients in whom blood flow from the CCA to the ECA could be achieved in 2 patients, and to the ECA and ICA in one patient, as predicted by the combined cv-Doppler-sequential CT-scans method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the patency of the ICA in the presence of a CCA occlusion can be reliably evaluated by the combined diagnostic procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The method may help to decide for further diagnostic work-up, e.g., specific selective injections and projections in more than two plans during cerebral angiography, and/or successful surgical intervention in a given patient with a CCA occlusion, even if angiographic findings are equivocal </plain></SENT>
