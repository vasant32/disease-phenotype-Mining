<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, annexin II was identified as a coreceptor on endothelial cells for plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined whether recombinant annexin II (rAN II) protein can modulate fibrinolytic activity on vascular endothelium in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of rAN II on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Addition of a fluorescent plasmin substrate revealed that HUVECs treated with rAN II exhibited significantly more plasmin generation than those treated with BSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, rAN II treatment of HUVECs restored plasmin generation impaired by plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> pretreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a rat carotid artery <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> model, the patency of thrombosed carotid arteries was significantly enhanced by rAN II injection, in contrast to BSA injection, without systemic blood coagulation dysregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that rAN II enhanced plasmin generation on vascular endothelium in vitro and reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in vivo, and concluded that enhancement of endothelial fibrinolytic activity by annexin II could modulate the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further study of rAN II in vitro and in vivo may lead to the establishment of novel therapeutic approaches to thrombogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
