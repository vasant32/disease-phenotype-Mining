<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In most models of experimental <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, healthy blood vessels are damaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This results in the formation of a platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> that is stabilized by <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> signaling via P2Y(12) receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, such models do not predict involvement of P2Y(12) in the clinically relevant situation of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> upon rupture of atherosclerotic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of P2Y(12) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation on (collagen-containing) atherosclerotic plaques in vitro and in vivo, by using a novel mouse model of atherothrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Plaques in the carotid arteries from Apoe(-/-) mice were acutely ruptured by ultrasound treatment, and the thrombotic process was monitored via intravital fluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Thrombus</z:e> formation in vitro was assessed in mouse and human blood perfused over collagen or plaque material under variable conditions of shear rate and coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Effects of two reversible P2Y(12) blockers, ticagrelor (AZD6140) and cangrelor (AR-C69931MX), were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> plaque rupture by ultrasound treatment provoked rapid formation of non-occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, which were smaller in size and unstable in the presence of P2Y(12) blockers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro, when mouse or human blood was perfused over collagen or atherosclerotic plaque material, blockage or deficiency of P2Y(12) reduced the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> and increased embolization events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These P2Y(12) effects were present at shear rates &gt;500 s(-1), and they persisted in the presence of coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>P2Y(12)-dependent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> stabilization was accompanied by increased fibrin(ogen) binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Platelet P2Y(12) receptors play a crucial role in the stabilization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> formed on atherosclerotic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This P2Y(12) function is restricted to high shear flow conditions, and is preserved in the presence of coagulation </plain></SENT>
