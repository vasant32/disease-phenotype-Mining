<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several different preparations of cross-linked <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (CLHb) are being evaluated for their efficacy and safety as red cell substitutes in a variety of preclinical and clinical settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because CLHb is known to sequester nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) and inhibit NO-mediated processes, we hypothesized that CLHb would have a hemostatic effect by enhancing platelet reactivity, inducing vasoconstriction, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Infusion of o-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16634">raffinose</z:chebi> CLHb shortened the prolonged microvascular <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time and decreased blood loss from ear incisions in rabbits rendered anemic and thrombocytopenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this hemostatic effect persisted for at least 24 hours after infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">Phenylephrine</z:chebi> induced a degree of vasoconstriction similar to that induced by CLHb but did not shorten the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time or decrease blood loss, suggesting that vasoconstriction alone cannot account for the hemostatic effect of CLHb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of CLHb-induced activation of coagulation in vivo, since infusion of CLHb did not increase circulating levels of thrombin-antithrombin complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro, CLHb abolished the inhibitory effect of the NO donor 3-morpholinosydnonimine on platelet aggregation and enhanced the aggregation of stimulated but not resting platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This potentiating effect was not attenuated by the addition of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase or catalase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the potential arterial thrombogenicity of CLHb, a model of carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was developed in rabbits without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with albumin infusion, CLHb infusion shortened the time to complete carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that CLHb may shift the thromboregulatory balance toward clot formation, resulting in decreased <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in anemic and thrombocytopenic rabbits and possibly increasing arterial thrombogenicity in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rabbits </plain></SENT>
