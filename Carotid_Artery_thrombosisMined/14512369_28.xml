<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to investigate the origin and pathophysiological importance of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We used the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30808">ferric chloride</z:chebi> model to induce carotid artery injury in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E knockout (apoE-/-) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ApoE-/- mice fed high-fat diet for 4 months developed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> and had significantly elevated plasma PAI-1 levels (2.3+/-0.3 versus 0.6+/-0.1 ng/mL in WT mice; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These mice exhibited a prothrombotic phenotype with shortened times to thrombotic <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> (8.6 versus 11.5 minutes; P&lt;0.001) and reduced recanalization rates (12% versus 51%; P&lt;0.0001) compared with WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry showed a significantly upregulated PAI-1 expression in P-selectin-positive (activated) endothelial cells lining <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing arterial segments and within the advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> of apoE-/- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant upregulation of PAI-1 expression was found in the other organs studied, and only trace amounts of PAI-1 mRNA were detected in murine platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, deletion of the PAI-1 gene reversed the prothrombotic tendency and reduced neointimal growth after injury in apoE-/- mice despite the persistence of excessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that increased vascular expression of PAI-1 may contribute to the elevated circulating levels of the inhibitor and be responsible, at least in part, for the prothrombotic phenotype in apoE-/- mice </plain></SENT>
