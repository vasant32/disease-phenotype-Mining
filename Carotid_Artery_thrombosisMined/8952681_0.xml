<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: There is debate over the therapeutic strategy in patients with lesions of both the coronary arteries and the carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Improvement in angioplasty techniques for the carotid artery would be a minimally invasive alternative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 1993 and June 1995, 12 patients who underwent endoluminal angioplasty of the carotid artery before coronary bypass surgery (mean 17.9 days before) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 70 +/- 3.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The carotid lesions were asymptomatic in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who had stable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean number of bypasses was 2.9 per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five patients had a contralateral stenosis of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Angioplasty was performed under cerebral protection using a three way coaxial catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A Strecker stent was required in 8 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient presented transient hemianopsia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were seen again at 4 months for an angiogram then at 6 months for a Doppler examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient needed complete redilatation with a stent and one other required <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoluminal angioplasty of the carotid arteries gave encouraging results in this high-risk population (underlying disease, age, bilateral carotid lesions, arterial coronary grafts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This technique should be used more widely for patients with severe multiple arterial lesions </plain></SENT>
