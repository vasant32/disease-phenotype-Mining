<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The goal of our study was to demonstrate the extension of the transitional zone (TZ) between elastic and muscular medial structure in carotid artery tripod </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A histologic study of 56 probes from 8 carotid artery tripods was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The probes were obtained from autopsies of 4 adults (mean age: 47.5 years, range 38 to 55 years) and were taken from 7 different topographic sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At each level of the CCA (at 1 cm and 2 cm proximal to the bifurcation as well as at the bifurcation) we observed an elastic arterial type in 24 (42.8%) probes with 11 to 20 (medium 15.0) elastic fibers per view field (200 x magnification) in the media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast the histologic structure of the ICA and ECA varied as follows: in 8 sections (14.3%) elastic arterial type with 11 to 16 (medium 13.1) elastic fibers, in 11 sections (19.6%) muscular arterial type with 2 to 5 (medium 3.5) elastic fibers and in 9 sections (16.1%) a transitional arterial type with 6 to 8 (medium 6.7) elastic fibers in the media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>Atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> have prevented the assessment of the arterial type in 4 probes (7.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The TZ in the medial structure of carotid artery tripods is exclusively localized in the ICA/ECA but not in the CCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ICA/ECA presented a TZ with a length up to 0.5 cm (4 probes; 25%), up to 1.5 cm (4 probes; 25%) and longer than 1.5 cm (6 probes; 37.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study we confirmed that in the carotid artery tripod, a TZ--an arterial segment with transition from elastic to muscular type--does exist, involving a variable length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore studies on the impact of the biomechanical properties of the TZ as a potential factor in atherosclerotic disease are justified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, the complex biomechanical behavior of the TZ should be considered prior to interventional procedures </plain></SENT>
