<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion associated with middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) embolic occlusion requires prompt revascularization to prevent devastating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the advent of endovascular techniques for chemical and mechanical thrombolysis, the clinical outcome of patients with major <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp> will improve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Finding the most expedient pathway to the site of end organ occlusion for thrombolysis is important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We present two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> secondary to thrombotic occlusion of the cervical ICA associated with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> embolic occlusion treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis via catheter navigation through the posterior communicating artery to the site of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No attempt was made to transverse the occluded ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Near complete restoration of flow was achieved in one patient and minimal vessel reopening was observed in the other patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both patients had good outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intra-arterial thrombolysis via Circle of Willis collaterals such as the posterior communicating artery for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thrombotic occlusion of the cervical internal carotid artery associated with embolic occlusion of the middle cerebral artery is a therapeutic option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This treatment option avoids the potential complications of navigating through an occluded proximal internal carotid artery and may expedite reopening of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
