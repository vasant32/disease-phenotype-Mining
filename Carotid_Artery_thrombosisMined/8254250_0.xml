<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The most suitable treatment for intraluminal carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> remains still a much debated question </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some authors have reported a lower morbidity in patients treated with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> or antiplatelet therapy; on the other side, urgent or delayed surgery is burdened with a high risk of perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over 11 years (october 1981-november 1992) 602 surgical revascularizations on epi-aortic vessels have been performed at Vascular Surgery Unit of Udine Regional Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only 2 cases of intraluminal carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were observed: both fulfilled the angiographic requirements for endovasal filling defect, surrounded by contrast medium, adherent to posterior wall and extending to distal internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First patient suffered a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> 20 days before surgery, the second one a previous major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> contralateral to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The former was given preoperatively a medical <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At operation we discovered a nearly complete resolution of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>: only its adherent base was still present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore we performed a routine endarterectomy and a <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi> patch angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The latter case reported had no preliminary medical treatment; a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> extending from carotid bulbus to external and internal carotid was detected and then removed without any distal embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Arteriotomy was closed by Dacron Velour patch angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred in both cases: our second patient showed a partial resolution of his motility deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>According to our limited experience, delayed surgical treatment of intraluminal carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> seems not to be affected with higher risk of perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than prophylactic carotid endarterectomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
