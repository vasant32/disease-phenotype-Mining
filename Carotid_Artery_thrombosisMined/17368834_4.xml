<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Improved carotid artery stenting (CAS) results are credited to the development of embolic protection devices (EPDs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reported are outcomes and technical failures of two classes of EPDs: distal balloon occlusion and distal filtration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present a retrospective review of 206 CAS procedures from April 2001-September 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Filters (AccuNet, Angioguard, Filterwire, or Emboshield) were used in 98 cases (48%), distal balloon occlusion (PercuSurge) in 94 (46%), and no protection in 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data include demographics and procedural records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 70 years (76% men, 24% women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 30 days, there were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo>, two major ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (1%), two minor posterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (1%), four <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (2%), and one major access site complication (0.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Major neurologic events were equally divided between balloon occlusion and filters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean balloon occlusion time was 12 min, with only two patients (2%) manifesting reversible neurologic intolerance during flow arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the last 100 cases, filter devices were preferentially used due to preserved antegrade flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, 11 cases (11%) necessitated intraoperative switching to balloon occlusion because of either extreme tortuosity or severe stenosis of the target lesion precluding passage of the filter element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CAS-specific equipment has improved procedural results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Despite theoretic advantages of filter EPDs, up to 10% of lesions are either too narrow or tortuous to allow safe passage of the filter element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Switching to a distal balloon occlusion system, which is well tolerated, may be preferred to unprotected predilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Practitioners of CAS should be versed in both </plain></SENT>
