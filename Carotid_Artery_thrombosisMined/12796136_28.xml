<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is recognized that complicated plaque largely accounts for the morbidity and mortality from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ideally, investigation of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients would identify atheromatous plaques independently of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that a magnetic resonance direct <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> imaging (MRDTI) technique demonstrates complicated atheroma as high signal within the carotid arterial wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used this technique to examine the prevalence of complicated carotid plaque in vivo in the ipsilateral arteries of recently symptomatic patients with suspected carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and to compare this with their contralateral arteries and with those of healthy age- and sex-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The carotid arteries of 120 patients with suspected severe carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> were imaged using MRDTI, as were 28 control arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High signal was not seen in any control artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there was a 60% prevalence of high signal, suggestive of complicated plaque in the patients' ipsilateral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of high signal was significantly greater in the patients' ipsilateral vessels compared with the contralateral, asymptomatic side (60% versus 36%, chi2 P&lt;0.001), particularly for vessels of only moderate stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MRDTI high signal suggestive of complicated plaque is prevalent in the ipsilateral carotid arteries of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and recent cerebral ischemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MRDTI has a potential role in identifying "at risk" plaque, studying atherogenesis and the effects of plaque-modifying strategies </plain></SENT>
