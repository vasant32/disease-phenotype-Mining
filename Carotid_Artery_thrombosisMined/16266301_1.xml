<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thrombin is one of the factors of blood coagulation cascade; however, it has a possibility to play a negative role in the graft antithrombogenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of our new grafts, thrombin-free fibrin-coated small caliber vascular prostheses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Knitted polyester fabric vascular prostheses 2 mm in internal diameter were coated with fibrin coating with thrombin (Graft I) or without thrombin (Graft II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both grafts were implanted in bilateral common carotid arteries of 35 Japanese white rabbits, with Graft I in one side and Graft II in the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Graft patency, histology, thrombin activity, and platelet deposition were compared between both grafts on postoperative days (PODs) 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, 30, and 60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both grafts were patent without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> or stenosis at each end point (maximal period, POD 60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Macro- and microscopic findings revealed that no obvious difference was observed between both grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Before graft implantation, thrombin activities in Grafts I and II were 0.711 +/- 0.086 and 0.009 +/- 0.007 optical density at 405 nm, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thrombin activity of Graft II was significantly less than that of Graft I in every period after graft implantation, and platelet deposition of Graft II was significantly less than that of Graft I until POD 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thrombin-free fibrin-coated vascular prostheses have superior performance of antithrombogenicity to conventional fibrin-coated vascular prostheses with thrombin </plain></SENT>
