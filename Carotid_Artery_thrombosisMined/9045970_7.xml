<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Local intra-arterial fibrinolysis (LIF) is considered to support spontaneous recanalisation, which does not usually occur fast enough to prevent an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, LIF may, at least theoretically, be especially useful in occlusions with large thromboembolic masses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report our experience of LIF with urokinase in 12 patients with combined occlusions of the distal internal carotid, anterior and middle cerebral arteries (carotid "T" occlusions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 4 patients who survived with minor neurological deficits (Barthel index &gt; 90), 4 with major deficits (Barthel index 40-55) and 4 patients died: in one of the last group a haematoma developed in a middle cerebral artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recanalisation and clinical outcome were parallel in 10 of 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A patient with excellent leptomeningeal collaterals had a good clinical outcome despite only moderate recanalisation, and the patient with the parenchymal haematoma had good recanalisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recanalisation with urokinase in carotid "T" occlusions is often poor, but outcome can be good if treatment starts early, recanalisation succeeds and leptomeningeal collateral supply is good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results therefore encourage us, unlike previously reported series, to perform LIF in this type of occlusion </plain></SENT>
