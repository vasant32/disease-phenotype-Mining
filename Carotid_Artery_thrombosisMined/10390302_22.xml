<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is now widely accepted that thrombotic coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> usually follows rupture of an unstable atherosclerotic plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The significance of such instability in arteries supplying the brain is less well appreciated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore describe the clinical and pathological features of recent, symptomatic internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> to examine the pathogenetic role of plaque instability at both extracranial and intracranial sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cases were selected from a consecutive series of 188 adult neuropathology autopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 90 of these, the principal neuropathological abnormality was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, in 14 cases due to recent occlusion of 1 or more segments of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In each case, a full systemic, cardiovascular, and neuropathological autopsy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plaque instability was assessed by the presence or absence of a large, necrotic, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> core; a thin, fibrous cap; and superficial <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 14 cases, 3 showed extracranial (carotid sinus), 7 intracranial, and 4 both extracranial and intracranial carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 6 of the 7 occluded carotid sinuses, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> overlay an ulcerated, unstable, atherosclerotic plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 1 extracranial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 11 intracranial occlusions, there was either no atheroma or a mildly stenotic, stable, fibrous plaque, and in these cases, the cause of occlusion was embolism (8 cases), giant-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> (1 case), and unknown (3 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Coronary-type rupture of an unstable atherosclerotic plaque is the usual cause of fatal occlusion of the carotid sinus, but other causes usually underlie intracranial carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The nature and consequences of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> require further study </plain></SENT>
