<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and cerebrovascular reserve (CVR) are both proven predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk in symptomatic patients with carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, hemispheric comparisons of CVR and OEF are significantly correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there was also substantial disagreement: hemispheres identified as compromised by CVR were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> by OEF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine whether regional comparisons could resolve the CVR-OEF discordance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also studied the relationship between white matter (WM) infarction and hemodynamic compromise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Quantitative CVR and OEF were measured in 12 symptomatic patients with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CVR and OEF comparisons were made in the anterior watershed (AWS), middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and WM territories using various thresholds for hemodynamic compromise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Associations with WM infarction were also recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Comparison of CVR and OEF for the AWS and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> showed high sensitivity (100%) with specificities of 83 and 40%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was also agreement (k=Cohen's Kappa) for the AWS (k=0.83) and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (k=0.39) territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CVR-OEF discordance was reduced with regional analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic compromise was more often found in patients with WM infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Regional comparison of CVR and OEF reduced the discordance compared with hemispheric analysis, especially for the AWS territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Despite the persistence of some regions with compromised CVR and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> OEF, CVR is able to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions with elevated OEF making it a useful screening technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Future studies are needed to understand whether those remaining regions with compromised CVR are also at increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> OEF </plain></SENT>
