<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This consideration was tested successfully using the nonlinear dynamics tools, like the computation of Lyapunov exponents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) architecture was formulated and used as a basis for detecting variabilities such as stenosis and occlusion in the physical state of internal carotid arterial Doppler signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The computed Lyapunov exponents of the internal carotid arterial Doppler signals were used as inputs of the MLPNN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess the performance of the detection process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The internal carotid arterial Doppler signals were classified with the accuracy varying from 94.87% to 97.44% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results confirmed that the proposed MLPNN trained with Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm has potential in detecting stenosis and occlusion in internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
