<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DR-536, on <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and thrombolysis in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The anticoagulated blood model of mise were administered with FA-I orally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The venous thrombogenesis inhibition model of rats were administered with FA-I by intestinal route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model of rabbits were given FA-I intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clotting time (CT), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), Euglobulin lysis time (ELT), fibrinogen (FIG) and hemorheology condition were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FA-I prolonged the CT, PT, APTT and TT, and decreased ELT and FIG significantly (P &lt; 0.05 or P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FA-I also improved the hemorheology conditions in the rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Both intravenous injection and oral administration of FA-I are effective in <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FA-I could become a pragmatic venoclysis thrombolytic drug or a peroral thrombolytic drug </plain></SENT>
