<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: When a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> occurs, pressure gradients in the arteries between sites proximal and distal to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> exert hydromechanical forces that push the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> distally, and potentially affect successful revascularization during clot removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationships between blood pressures that occur immediately distal and proximal to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>, systemic blood pressure and clinical variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 36 patients with embolism of the internal carotid artery (13 patients) or the proximal middle cerebral artery (23 patients) were treated using intra-arterial thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean blood pressure (MBP) at the sites proximal (proximal MBP) and distal (distal MBP) to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> was measured with a microcatheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously, the systemic MBP was recorded by cuff measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Proximal, distal and systemic MBPs (mean±SD) were 95.2±13.2 mm Hg, 35.9±13.5 mm Hg and 98.2±12.2 mm Hg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proximal MBP was significantly higher in the patients with systemic MBP≥100 mm Hg than those with systemic MBP&lt;100 mm Hg (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The distal MBP showed no difference between the high and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> systemic MBP groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Higher systemic blood pressure produced stronger hydromechanical forces on the clot, forming a proximal-distal blood pressure gradient across the clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The stronger hydromechanical force could result in higher compaction of the clot, thus making it more difficult to remove </plain></SENT>
