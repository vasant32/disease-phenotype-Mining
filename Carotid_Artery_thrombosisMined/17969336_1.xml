<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a case of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> in-stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> after carotid artery angioplasty and stenting (CAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was a 72-year-old man who had severe asymptomatic right carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He received CAS with distal protection, and gained 100% opening of the right carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The administration of dual antiplatelet therapy (Aspirin 100 mg/day+Cilostazol 100 mg/day), which had been given since two weeks before the procedure, was continued afterwords </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the seventh day after the stent placement, the patient showed sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and conjugated deviation of both eyes to the right side and followed by falling into a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Emergency angiography showed near occlusion of the right carotid artery, suggesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> in-stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conjunction with the intravenous administration of tissue plasminogen activator (1300,000 IU), we performed additional stent placement on the stented portion of the ICA and gained full recanalization of the ICA about three hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient showed rapid recovery and returned home with slight <z:hpo ids='HP_0002312'>clumsiness</z:hpo> of his right hand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> in-stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> after CAS is a rather rare complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We discuss on the possible cause of this and stress the necessity of an additional emergency stenting to gain rapid recanalization </plain></SENT>
