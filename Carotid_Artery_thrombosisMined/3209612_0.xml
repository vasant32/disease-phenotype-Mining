<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Platelets obtained at the induction of the <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anaesthetic</z:chebi> were labelled with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">Indium</z:chebi> 111 Oxine and subsequently re-infused prior to restoration of blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Post-operative sequential platelet counts using a Selo CSZ counter were undertaken, which demonstrated a substantial rise at the sites of CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These counts rose to peak levels between 7-88 minutes after declamping with a median peak time of 20 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Continued high levels of labelled platelet accumulation persisted for 48-96 hours following CEA and in some instances persisted for three weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that antiplatelet agents should therefore be active when carotid declamping occurs and administered for at least three weeks following CEA </plain></SENT>
