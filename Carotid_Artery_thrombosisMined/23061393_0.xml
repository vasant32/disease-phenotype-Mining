<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective chart review of patients who had presented with symptomatic ICAT at their institution between 2001 and 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (16 males and 8 females) with ICAT presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (18 patients) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> ([<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>], 6 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were initially treated using anticoagulation with or without antiplatelet drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight of these patients had no or only mild carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> on initial angiography and were treated with medical management alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining 16 patients had moderate or severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> on initial angiography; of these, 10 underwent delayed revascularization (8 patients, carotid endarterectomy [CEA]; 2 patients, angioplasty and stenting), 2 refused revascularization, and 4 were treated with medical therapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient had multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> despite medical therapy and eventually underwent CEA; the remaining 23 patients had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patient suffered ischemic or hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> while on anticoagulation therapy, either during the perioperative period or in the long-term follow-up; 1 patient died of an unrelated condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 16.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study suggest that initial anticoagulation for symptomatic ICAT leads to a low rate of recurrent ischemic events and that carotid revascularization, if indicated, can be safely performed in a delayed manner </plain></SENT>
