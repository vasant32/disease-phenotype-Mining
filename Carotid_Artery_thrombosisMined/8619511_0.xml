<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In both cases, the atheromas caused more than 75% reduction in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> size of the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, they were rich in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> content, which accounted for more than 40% of the cross-sectional area of the atheromatous plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is postulated that high-grade stenotic carotid atheromatous plaques with a high <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> content are at an increased risk of giving rise to subsequent neurologic complications, including massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, as exemplified by the present 2 reported cases </plain></SENT>
