<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transient distal platelet accumulation after common carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CCAT) leads to hemodynamic, metabolic, and molecular events that may influence the response of the postthrombotic brain to secondary insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated how a thromboembolic insult would affect histopathological outcome when combined with an ischemic insult induced 24 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three groups of rats underwent either (1) CCAT+10 minutes of normothermic 2-vessel occlusion (n=6), (2) CCAT+sham <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> procedures (n=6), or (3) sham CCAT procedures+10 minutes of 2-vessel occlusion (n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 7 days, rats were perfused for quantitative histopathological and immunocytochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rats undergoing combined insults (group 1) had significantly larger areas of ischemic injury (P&lt;0.05) within the cerebral cortex, striatum, and thalamus compared with the other, single-injury groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased ischemic damage included selective neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, infarction, and focal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By means of glial fibrillary acidic protein immunocytochemistry and lectin histochemistry, reactive astrocytes and microglia were found to be associated with widespread tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, infrequent infarction or CA1 hippocampal neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was observed in groups 2 and 3, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A prior thromboembolic event is a risk factor for widespread <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> when combined with a delayed ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The understanding of what factors enhance the susceptibility of the postthrombotic brain to secondary insults may aid in the development of neuroprotective strategies to be applied after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> to prevent the initiation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
