<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 34 cases with multiple hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>), 23 cases with multiple episodes of transient monocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> (TMBs), 33 asymptomatic cases, and 51 cases with prolonged or persisting neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> and TMBs correlated best with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (1 mm. or less), less well with the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333205,C1260883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mural thrombus</z:e>, and not at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with ulceration of plaque and intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The residual lumen in asymptomatic cases was wider </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The persistence of neurologic deficits correlated best with carotid occlusion or near-occlusion (37 of 51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In only 3 cases was there evidence of embolism from ulceration with minor stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were many variations in the size, form, composition, site, and number of mural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, ulcerations, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp>; to provide an accurate picture, serial sections are necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Large rounded cavities in plaques sometimes were empty, smooth-lined cul-de-sacs rather than eroding ulcerations (16 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> are probably not an important source of embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ulceration and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> into plaque posed little or no threat in the present series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using the pathologic and clinical data, inferences have been made concerning the relative frequency of embolism and hemodynamic failure in the mechanism of the varied events associated with carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Observations have been made on a few additional points--selective involvement of the lower extremity, prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms during sleep, unusual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221163" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">motor disorders</z:e>, the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> embolism and progression of stenosis </plain></SENT>
