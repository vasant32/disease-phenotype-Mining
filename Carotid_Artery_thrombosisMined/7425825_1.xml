<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 34 cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0553690" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="rind|RIND">reversible ischemic neurological defects</z:e> were diagnosed; 33 patients suffered from completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In most cases the completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> took place without previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A very good tendency toward recovery was observed in 60 of 67 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stenoses or occlusions were found in only 21.5% of the clinically affected vessel regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, 50% of those patients, on whom panangiography was performed, were shown to have stenoses or occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stenotic vessel wall lesions are also obviously to be expected in clinically nonaffected vessel regions; consequently, in cases of cerebral circulatory disturbances, angiographic investigation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> craniocervical vessels is advisable </plain></SENT>
