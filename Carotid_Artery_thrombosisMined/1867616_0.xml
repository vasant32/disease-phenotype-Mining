<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Platelets aggregate by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi>-prostacycline mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">Thromboxane</z:chebi> synthetase inhibitors which have been safely administered to humans should reduce platelet deposition after surgical therapy and therefore reduce peri-operative mortality and the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A randomized prospective controlled trial was designed to determine vessel patency and platelet deposition associated with the use of 3 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg of Furegrelate (Upjohn U63557A) daily in dogs, who were to have carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 46 treated and 46 control dogs had total carotid patency of 96% and 76% respectively (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen dogs treated with 30 mg/kg Furegrelate had no occlusions, compared with a 19% prevalence in 13 controls (P less than 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furegrelate 10 mg/kg significantly lowered platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Platelet deposition was not significantly changed, however </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reason for this disparity was a probable persistence of vessel wall factors which promoted platelet deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This approach might therefore lower rates of peri-operative <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> but it would be very unlikely to alter the incidence of restenosis or embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further research could be directed towards modifying the stimuli for platelet deposition upon the endarterectomy site </plain></SENT>
