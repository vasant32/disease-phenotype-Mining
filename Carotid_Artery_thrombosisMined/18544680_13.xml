<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Platelets contain 40 times as much TGF-beta1 as other cells and secrete it as an inactive (latent) form in complex with latency-associated <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (LAP), which is <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bonded via Cys33 to latent TGF-beta binding protein 1 (LTBP-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Little is known about how latent TGF-beta1 becomes activated in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we show that TGF-beta1 released from platelets or fibroblasts undergoes dramatic activation when subjected to stirring or shear forces, providing a potential mechanism for physiologic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">Thiol</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> exchange appears to contribute to the process based on the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi>-reactive reagents and differences in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi> labeling of TGF-beta1 before and after stirring or shear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Activation required the presence of LTBP, as TGF-beta1 contained in complex with only LAP could not be activated by stirring when studied as either a recombinant purified protein complex or in the platelet releasates or sera of mice engineered to contain an LAP C33S mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Release and activation of latent TGF-beta1 in vivo was demonstrated in a mouse model 5 minutes after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data potentially provide a novel mechanism for in vivo activation of TGF-beta1 </plain></SENT>
