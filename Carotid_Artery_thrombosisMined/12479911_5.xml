<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Endovascular brachytherapy for the prevention of intimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> (IH) and restenosis after balloon/stent angioplasty has proven effective both in animal preparations and clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A variety of beta-emitting isotopes and catheter-based devices have been developed for the delivery of low-dose radiation in clinical coronary and peripheral trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No platform, however, has yet been developed for brachytherapy in concert with vascular surgical operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the vascular histopathologic response following balloon injury to rabbit carotid arteries with and without topically applied low-dose beta-radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The beta-emitting isotope <z:chebi fb="19" ids="33324">strontium</z:chebi>-90 (Sr-90) was conjugated onto the matrix of <z:chebi fb="80" ids="53550">polypropylene</z:chebi> (PLYP) mesh </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rabbit carotid arteries were balloon-injured with a #2 embolectomy catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six carotid arteries were wrapped with nonradioactive PLYP mesh (controls) and Sr-90 ( approximately 90 microCi) PLYP mesh in order to deliver low-dose radiation to the vessel wall from the external (adventitial) surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tissue was harvested at 6 weeks and processed for histologic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was consistent blockade of fibrocellular neointima formation with virtually no neointima present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treated segments, compared to moderate neointima formation in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Medial thinning and smooth muscle cell (SMC) <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> were also associated with topical brachytherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: beta-Radiation applied by an externally wrapped PLYP mesh labeled with Sr-90 markedly suppressed neointima formation in an animal vascular surgical injury model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies, however, are necessary to determine a suitable isotope and dosage for clinical application </plain></SENT>
