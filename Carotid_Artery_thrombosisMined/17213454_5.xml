<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Some reports of reconstructive management of carotid blowout syndrome (CBS) with stent-grafts are promising, but some are unfavorable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study sought to evaluate the hemostatic efficacy, safety, and outcome of reconstructive, endovascular stent-graft placement in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278996" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">head-and-neck cancers</z:e> in association with CBS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278996" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">head-and-neck cancers</z:e> with CBS were treated with self-expandable stent-grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the initial hemostatic results, complications, and outcomes by assessing the clinical and imaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immediate hemostasis was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Initial complications included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 1 patient and asymptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the carotid artery in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Delayed complications included rebleeding, delayed carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rebleeding was noted in 4 patients and was successfully managed with a second stent-graft and embolization in 2 of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Delayed carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with follow-up after 3 months was found in 3 patients, 1 of whom had associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006105" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain abscesses</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although stent-grafts achieved immediate and initial hemostasis in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278996" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">head-and-neck cancers</z:e> and CBS, long-term safety, stent patency, and permanency of hemostasis appeared unfavorable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This treatment may be for temporary or emergency purposes rather than serving as a permanent measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We suggest its applications in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> CBS that precludes performance of an occlusion test, as well as when carotid occlusion poses an unusually high risk of neurologic morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We also propose prophylactic antibiotic treatment and combined embolization of pathologic vascular feeders to improve outcomes </plain></SENT>
