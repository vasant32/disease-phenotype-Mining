<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The recent demonstration of the efficacy of carotid endarterectomy in certain patients emphasizes the advantages of having a noninvasive, accurate means of evaluating the carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Advances in magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) angiography now allow accurate depiction of the carotid arteries that may be adequate for surgical planning in many cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report examines the accuracy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography compared with that of conventional angiography in symptomatic patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy and compares them with surgical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one carotid arteries in 20 patients were treated surgically for severe stenosis or occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and conventional angiograms, which were interpreted on a five-grade scale by two independent neuroradiologists who were unaware of the patient's clinical history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two studies were highly correlated, particularly in the case of severe stenosis and occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no false-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> studies that missed surgically significant lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two cases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography overestimated the stenosis by one grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography, surgically significant stenosis appears as focal areas of signal intensity loss at the level of stenosis with reappearance of the signal distally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If the distal signal intensity does not reappear, the artery is likely to be occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In symptomatic patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiograms that demonstrate a flow-void gap with distal reappearance at a site consistent with the symptoms may be adequate as the sole preoperative study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy on this basis are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The factors that contribute to artifactual and overestimated stenosis are reviewed </plain></SENT>
