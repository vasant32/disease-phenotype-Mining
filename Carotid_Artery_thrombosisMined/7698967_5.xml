<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study has been a prospective randomized evaluation of the relative risks and benefits of saphenous vein patch versus <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi> patch material for carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During a 4-year period, 84 patients undergoing 95 carotid endarterectomies were randomized into two groups: 45 venous patch (n = 40) and 50 PTFE patch (n = 44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> operations were carried out under general anesthesia and systematic placement of a shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were evaluated at 1, 3, 6 months and every year with doppler, periorbitary photoplethysmography, intravenous digital subtraction angiography, and neurologic assessment (mean follow-up 29 +/- 1 month) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Operative time among patients having <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi> patch was significantly longer (p &lt; 0.05) than among those having saphenous vein patch, due to <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> from suture holes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Perioperatively, no neurologic complications or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were observed in venous patch patients, however there was a permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from arterial wall disruption in the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi> patch group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of aneurysmal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> in the saphenous vein patch group (15.5%) was higher than for the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi> patch group (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On late follow-up, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or patch rupture were observed in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recurrent stenosis occurred in 2 cases having <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi> patch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One reoperation for recurrence was required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, one patient with <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi> patch angioplasty developed an infected false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> at 7 months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
