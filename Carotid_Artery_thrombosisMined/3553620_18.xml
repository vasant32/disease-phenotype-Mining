<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first 82 patients had primary closure of the arteriotomy, whereas the subsequent 70 patients underwent closure with Dacron patch angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Duplex scanning was undertaken postoperatively in 102 of these patients with a mean follow-up period of 17 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Perioperative <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> occurred in two patients (1.3%), late postoperative recurrent stenosis in 14 patients (13.7%), and late postoperative occlusion in three patients (2.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the various factors investigated for their correlation with late recurrent stenosis or occlusion, only three were significant: the female sex (recurrent stenosis in 29% vs. 8%, p less than 0.05), a small (less than 4 mm) internal carotid artery (37% vs. 12%, p less than 0.05), and failure to close the arteriotomy with a patch (29% vs. 6%, p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The development of recurrent carotid lesions appeared independent of smoking history, antiplatelet therapy, use of a shunt, or extent of carotid plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that patients with small internal carotid arteries, specifically female patients, are at greater risk for recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patch angioplasty may decrease this risk and should be considered in these patients </plain></SENT>
