<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Published evidence suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> 3 kinase-β (PI3K-β) plays an important role in platelet aggregation and shear activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TGX-221 is a selective PI3K-β inhibitor with a good separation of anti-thrombotic efficacy and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (therapeutic index) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to further evaluate potential of a PI3K-β inhibitor as an anti-thrombotic agent by determining the therapeutic index in another species and efficacy model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reported effects of TGX-221 in rats were also confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: TGX-221 (0.3 + 0.3, 1 + 1, 3 + 3 mg/kg + mg/kg/hr, i.v.) or vehicle was given to mice starting 15 min prior to FeCl(3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (AT), tail or <z:mp ids='MP_0000533'>kidney bleeding</z:mp> time (BT) procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Integrated blood flow over 30 min (%baseline mean ± <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) improved (p &lt; 0.05) with TGX-221 doses 1 + 1 (49 ± 13.9%) and 3+3 (88 ± 10.6%) versus 0.3 + 0.3 (10 ± 0.8%) and vehicle (10 ± 0.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vascular patency (non-occluded/total arteries) improved (p &lt; 0.01) with TGX-221 doses of 3 + 3 (7/8), but not 0.3 + 0.3 (0/8) or 1 + 1 (4/8) versus vehicle (0/8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tail BT (<z:chebi fb="63" ids="30000">sec</z:chebi>) increased (p &lt; 0.05) with TGX-221 doses of 3 + 3 (median 1560) and 1 + 1 (1305) versus vehicle (225) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean renal BT (<z:chebi fb="63" ids="30000">sec</z:chebi>) increased (p &lt; 0.05) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> TGX-221 groups (3 + 3: 510 + 26; 1 + 1: 478 + 41; 0.3 + 0.3: 246 + 37) versus vehicle (123 + 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For comparison, a reference agent, aspirin (30 mpk, i.p.) increased tail BT 1.9X and renal BT 2.6X </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The novel finding of a clear impact on hemostasis by TGX-221 was demonstrated by increased <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in two models in mice at anti-thrombotic doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results suggest a narrower therapeutic index for this PI3K-β inhibitor than previously recognized, at least for this species </plain></SENT>
