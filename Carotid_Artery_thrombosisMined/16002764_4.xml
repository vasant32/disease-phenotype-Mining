<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to investigate the relation between atherosclerotic plaque characteristics and the occurrence of microemboli or adverse events during CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients (n=200, 205 procedures) eligible for CEA were monitored by perioperative transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following phases were discriminated during CEA: dissection, shunting, release of the clamp, and wound closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each carotid plaque was stained for collagen, macrophages, smooth muscle cells, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>, and elastin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Semiquantitative analyses were performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stainings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plaques were categorized into 3 groups based on overall appearance (fibrous, fibroatheromatous, or atheromatous) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fibrous plaques were associated with the occurrence of more microemboli during clamp release and wound closure compared with atheromatous plaques (P=0.04 and P=0.02, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>Transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> and minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred in 5 of 205 (2.4%) and 6 of 205 (2.9%) patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adverse cerebral outcome was significantly related to the number of microembolic events during dissection (P=0.003) but not during shunting, clamp release, or wound closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More cerebrovascular adverse events occurred in patients with atheromatous plaques (7/69) compared with patients with fibrous or fibroatheromatous plaques (4/138) (P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperatively, a higher number of microemboli were associated with the presence of a fibrous but not an atheromatous plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, atheromatous plaques were more prevalent in patients with subsequent immediate adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, specifically the number of microemboli detected during the dissection phase were related to immediate adverse events </plain></SENT>
