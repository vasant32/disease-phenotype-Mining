<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Between 1982 and 1984, 181 operations of the carotid artery were performed--180 of these in primary awake patients--36 in stage I (19.9%), 72 in stage II (39.8%), 72 in stage IV (39.8%) and only one in stage III (0.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>144 patients (79.6%) tolerated clamping of the carotid artery very well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 37 patients (20.4%) clamping was not tolerated (two patients, in whom the control of cerebral function was not possible, were submitted to the latter group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In three of 181 patients clamping-intolerance started at the end of operation, more than 30 minutes after clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clamping intolerance in these cases was found to be confined to pulmonary and cardiac factors, no shunt was used, but operation was brought to an end as quickly as possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complications were present in 15 patients (8.3%), three of them resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (hospital mortality rate 1.7%), 2 of them in permanent loss of function (morbidity rate 1.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only in 2 patients (asystolism with consecutive successful reanimation in one case, and thoracotomy due to enlargement of surgical procedure in the other case) a primary general anaesthesia would have facilitated surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgery of the carotid artery under local anaesthesia is considered to be a guarantee for a secure intraoperative surveillance followed by a low postoperative complication rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a few cases more difficult surgical procedures have to be accepted in account of that </plain></SENT>
