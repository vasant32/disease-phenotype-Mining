<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop a murine model to examine the antithrombotic and antiinflammatory functions of human thrombomodulin in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Knock-in mice that express human thrombomodulin from the murine thrombomodulin gene locus were generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, human thrombomodulin knock-in mice exhibited decreased protein C activation in the aorta (P&lt;0.01) and lung (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Activation of endogenous protein C following infusion of thrombin was decreased by 90% in knock-in mice compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> induced by photochemical injury occurred more rapidly in knock-in mice (12±3 minutes) than in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice (31±6 minutes; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No differences in serum cytokine levels were detected between knock-in and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice after injection of endotoxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When crossed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E-deficient mice and fed a Western diet, knock-in mice had a further decrease in protein C activation but did not exhibit increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Expression of human thrombomodulin in place of murine thrombomodulin produces viable mice with a prothrombotic phenotype but unaltered responses to systemic inflammatory or atherogenic stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This humanized animal model will be useful for investigating the function of human thrombomodulin under pathophysiological conditions in vivo </plain></SENT>
