<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our study was designed to clarify whether this association is based on C pneumoniae-induced transformation of a stable into an unstable atherosclerotic plaque or on stimulation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> leading to increased thrombotic <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp> by C pneumoniae <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler ultrasonographic monitoring of the middle cerebral artery during carotid endarterectomy offers the opportunity to study, before removal of the plaque, atherothrombotic emboli dislodging from an unstable carotid plaque (plaque-related emboli) and emboli related to (excessive) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation at the endarterectomy site after removal of the plaque and restoration of flow (<z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>-related emboli) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: C pneumoniae IgA (&gt; or =1/16) and IgG (&gt; or =1/64) seropositivity was assessed in 53 patients with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> undergoing carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The removed carotid plaques were studied histologically to assess plaque instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plaque- and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>-related emboli were registered in 43 patients with an adequate transtemporal window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IgA seropositivity (58%) was associated significantly with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>-related embolization (P=0.030) but not with plaque-related embolization or with histological plaque instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: C pneumoniae serology is associated with microembolization after endarterectomy and restoration of flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since these microemboli represent platelet aggregations and are related to cerebrovascular complications, our data suggest that C pneumoniae <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> contributes to cerebrovascular events in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> through stimulation of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
