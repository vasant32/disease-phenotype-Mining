<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recognizing the usefulness of the central <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38275">pyrrolidinone</z:chebi> template for the presentation of ligands to the S-1 and S-4 subsites of fXa, studies to optimize the P-1 and P-4 groups were initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sulfonamidopyrrolidinones containing 4-hydroxy- and 4-aminobenzamidines were discovered to be effective inhibitors of fXa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>X-ray crystallographic experiments in trypsin and molecular modeling studies suggest that our inhibitors bind by insertion of the 4-hydroxybenzamidine moiety into the S-1 subsite of the fXa active site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the P-4 groups examined, the pyridylthienyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35358">sulfonamides</z:chebi> were found to confer excellent potency and selectivity especially in combination with 4-hydroxybenzamidine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compound 20b (RPR130737) was shown to be a potent fXa inhibitor (K(i) = 2 nM) with selectivity against structurally related serine proteinases (&gt;1000 times) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preliminary biological evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of this inhibitor in common assays of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in vitro (e.g. activated partial thromboplastin time) and in vivo (e.g. rat FeCl(2)-induced carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model) </plain></SENT>
