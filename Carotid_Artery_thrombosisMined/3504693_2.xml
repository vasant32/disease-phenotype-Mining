<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 27 central neurologic complications were observed, 14 were transient and 13 were permanent neurologic deficits, nine of which resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The causes of these accidents were: embolism (12), intolerance to clamping (7), carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (3), and reperfusion injury (2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In three cases no cause could be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative predictive factors for these complications were analyzed statistically by multivariate analysis techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A high-risk group was identified, characterized by diffuse atherosclerotic disease and by the presence of a previous neurologic deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevention of neurologic complications in carotid surgery goes far beyond the controversy of whether or not a temporary inlying shunt should be used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In our opinion indications for shunting are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurologic complications can be prevented by maintaining awareness of certain temporary contraindications in patients with permanent neurologic deficits and by exacting operative techniques </plain></SENT>
