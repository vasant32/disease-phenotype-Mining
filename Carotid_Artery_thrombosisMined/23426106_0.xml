<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the prothrombotic role of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> during aging, we tested the hypothesis that aged mice overexpressing the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzyme <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase-1 (Gpx1) are protected from experimental <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Susceptibility to carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was first examined in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> C57BL/6J mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After photochemical injury of the carotid artery, the time to stable occlusion was significantly shorter in 12- and 18-month-old mice compared with 4-month-old mice (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unlike <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, transgenic mice overexpressing Gpx1 (Gpx1 Tg) did not exhibit shortened times to occlusion of the carotid artery at 12 or 18 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> mice also exhibited increased susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> after inferior vena cava ligation at 12 or 18 months of age (P&lt;0.05 versus 4 months of age) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gpx1 Tg mice were protected from this aging-related enhanced susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age-dependent platelet hyperactivation, evidenced by increased <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi>, fibrinogen binding, and activation of fibrinogen receptor αIIbβ3, was observed in thrombin-activated platelets from <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> but not Gpx1 Tg mice (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Enhanced platelet activation responses in aged mice were also prevented by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi>-catalase or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2781">apocynin</z:chebi>, an inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aged mice displayed increased intraplatelet expression of p47(phox) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase-1, suggesting a mechanistic pathway for increased <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> is a key mediator of platelet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> and enhanced thrombotic susceptibility in aged mice </plain></SENT>
