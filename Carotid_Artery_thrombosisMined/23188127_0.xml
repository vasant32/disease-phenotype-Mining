<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: An optimal strategy to improve reperfusion in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp> is a recognized clinical need </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that hirudin (thrombin inhibitor) and S18886 [S18, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> A(2) receptor (TP) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>] would improve blood flow and reperfusion rates after thrombolysis with the direct-acting fibrinolytic enzyme alfimeprase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In anesthetized beagles, carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was induced by electrolytic endothelial injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 30 minutes of occlusion, animals were administered vehicle, hirudin, and/or S18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Carotid artery blood flow was monitored for 90 minutes after the infusion of alfimeprase or recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to reperfusion was more rapid in animals treated with alfimeprase than in those treated with rt-PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the animals treated with hirudin + S18 + alfimeprase maintained vessel patency, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> vehicle-treated animals reoccluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In animals treated with hirudin + S18 + alfimeprase, time to reocclusion and total reflow time after thrombolysis were longer compared with vehicle-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The quality and quantity of blood flow were most improved in animals treated with hirudin + S18 + alfimeprase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in time to reocclusion, total reflow time, and quality and quantity of blood flow between vehicle + rt-PA-treated animals and hirudin + S18 + rt-PA-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dual antithrombotic therapy with hirudin and S18 improves reperfusion after thrombolysis with alfimeprase but not rt-PA </plain></SENT>
