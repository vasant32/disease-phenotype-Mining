<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study set out to characterise plaque composition in symptomatic (SYM) and asymptomatic (ASYM) patients and to identify, if possible, the origin of intra-plaque haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-nine plaques (50 SYM and 9 ASYM) were serially sectioned and examined for haemorrhage, haemosiderin, fibrin, cholesterol and collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoperoxidase and electron microscopy studies were carried out on sections from five plaques in order to identify blood breakdown products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intra-plaque haemorrhage was identified in 40 (68%) plaques and was similar in SYM and ASYM plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In only one did it constitute more than 15% of plaque content, and in the remainder it consisted of small collections of erythrocytes constituting greater than 1% of plaque content in only 21 (35%) plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The predominant non-fibrous component was a pink amorphous material mixed with cholesterol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Apart from traces of platelet breakdown products there was no evidence of haemorrhage in this pink material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plaque roof rupture or ulceration was seen in 39 (66%) and in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases overlay the amorphous/cholesterol material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Blood vessels were identified in 51 87%) plaques but were in close proximity to haemorrhage in only nine (15%) </plain></SENT>
