<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Whether atherosclerotic disease predisposes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, manifested as increased carotid intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) or presence of carotid plaque, is associated with increased incidence of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (VTE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities study is a prospective cohort of adults aged 45-64 years, examined at baseline (1987-89) and followed for cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bilateral carotid ultrasound for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> measurements was done at baseline for portions of the common and internal carotid arteries, and carotid bifurcation and also to detect the presence of carotid plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria included baseline <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> use, history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or VTE, and incomplete data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>First VTE during follow-up was validated using abstracted medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 13,081 individuals followed for a mean of 12.5 years, 225 first VTE events were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unadjusted hazard ratios (HR) (95% CI) of VTE across quartiles of baseline <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> were 1.0, 1.16 (0.77-1.75), 1.64 (1.12-2.40), and 1.52 (1.03-2.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, this association disappeared after adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity (HRs: 1.0, 1.06, 1.40, and 1.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further adjustment for body mass index and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> weakened the relative risks even further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Presence of carotid plaque at baseline also was not associated with VTE occurrence; adjusted HR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.72-1.29 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Increased carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> or presence of carotid plaque was not associated with an increased incidence of VTE in this middle-aged cohort, suggesting subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> itself is not a VTE risk factor </plain></SENT>
