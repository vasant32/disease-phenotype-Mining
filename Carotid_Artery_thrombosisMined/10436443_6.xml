<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: After carotid endarterectomy, intraoperative findings and outcome of immediate reoperation of patients who had an intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were compared with those of patients who had an early postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 2250 carotid endarterectomies performed between 1980 and 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (group A) was detected after 41 of the 2250 operations (1.8%), whereas early postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (group B) developed after 18 of the 2250 operations (0.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients from both groups were reoperated on within 1 hour after neurological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Positive intraoperative findings that could be corrected during immediate reoperation were: (1) thrombotic occlusion of the carotid artery that was operated on caused by technical error, which was found in nine of 41 patients (22%) in group A and in 11 of 18 patients (61%) in group B (P =.009); (2) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333205,C1260883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mural thrombus</z:e> caused by technical error without occlusion, which was detected in seven of 41 patients (17%) in group A and in two of 18 patients (11%) in group B (P &gt;.05); and (3) technical error without a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, which was found in eight of 41 patients (20%) in group A and in three of 18 patients (17%) in group B (P &gt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A patent carotid artery was found in 17 of 41 patients (42%) in group A and in two of 18 patients (11%) in group B (P =.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty of the 41 patients (49%) in group A died, and four of 18 patients (22%) in group B died (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Major neurological deficit remained in nine of 41 patients (22%) in group A and four of 18 patients (22%) in group B (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Total recovery occurred in seven of 41 patients (17%) in group A and in eight of 18 patients (45%) in group B (P = 0.058) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> during immediate reoperation was more frequent in patients who had an early postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than in patients who had an intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It appears that patients who had an intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have a higher incidence of uncorrectable lesions </plain></SENT>
