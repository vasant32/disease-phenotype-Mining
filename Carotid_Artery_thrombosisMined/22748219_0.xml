<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Today, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is one of the most widely occurring diseases in modern life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Drugs with thrombolytic functions are the most effective methods in the treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among them, Douchi fibrinolytic enzyme (DFE) is a promising agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DFE was isolated from Douchi, a typical and popular soybean-fermented food in China, and it can dissolve fibrin directly and efficiently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A strain, Bacillus subtilis LD-8547 produced DFE with high fibrinolytic activity has been isolated in our lab previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the study, thrombolytic effect of DFE from Bacillus subtilis LD-8547 was studied in vitro and in vivo systematically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed that DFE played a significant role in thrombolysis and anticoagulation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>And the thrombolytic effects correlated with DFE in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vivo, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> toxicity assay showed that DFE had no obvious <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> toxicity to mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Test of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3435">carrageenan</z:chebi>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in mice indicated that the DFE significantly prevented tail <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> model test indicated that Douchi fibrinolytic enzyme DFE had thrombolytic effect on carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of rabbits in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other results in vivo indicated that DFE could increase <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and clotting time obviously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The DFE isolated from Bacillus subtilis LD-8547 has obvious thrombolytic effects in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This function demonstrates that this enzyme can be a useful tool for preventing and treating clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
