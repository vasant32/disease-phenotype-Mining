<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the incidence of this complication of an accident almost unique to childhood is unknown, 2 out of 15 children in a consecutive series with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> had a history of such trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This suggests that specific inquiry concerning such injuries should be made in any child with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, focal neurologic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physicians seeing patients with paratonsillar injuries should be aware that neurologic complications may ensue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a rule, there is a period of up to twenty-four hours from the time of injury to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of neurologic symptoms; this may cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> with an intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> in patients with a history of prior or associated head injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of internal-carotid-<z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> can be proved clinically only by angiography, which should be performed before therapy is undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One third of the children with internal-carotid-<z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> after intraoral trauma died; the constant pathological finding was extension of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> distally into the major intracranial arteries, with massive infarction of the hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A theory of the pathogenesis of occlusion of the internal carotid artery after nonpenetrating trauma is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A plan of therapy based on this hypothesis is considered </plain></SENT>
