<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Intra-carotid urokinase (UK) infusion in 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> internal carotid artery (ICA) territorial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> achieved immediate recanalization in 45% and the clinical outcome in patients with recanalization was superior to that of patients without recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The procedure was most effective in patients with smaller <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp>: 7 of 10 patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branch occlusions (M2 to M4) achieved recanalization compared to only 2 of 10 with distal ICA or M1 occlusions, which should be an important issue for the critical evaluation of the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy (TT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic transformation was observed in 9 patients on CT scan; petechial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in 5 and intraparenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> formation in 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 4 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> formation, clinical deterioration was seen in 3 cases and the angiography at the immediate end of the UK infusion showed recanalization in only one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average dose of UK in patients with parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> formation was higher than that of patients without hemorrhagic transformation (123.3 x 10(4) units vs 101 x 10(4) units) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The administration of a large dose of UK, probably more than 100 x 10(4) units, and the absence of immediate recanalization seemed to increase the risk of parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite the effort of investigators, the in-hospital time delay for the TT was significant which was mainly related to the time consuming preparation for angiography especially during night </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A more effective system for the earlier intervention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> needs to be developed </plain></SENT>
