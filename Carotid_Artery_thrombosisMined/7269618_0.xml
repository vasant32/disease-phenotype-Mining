<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> were determined in 111 CSF and blood samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CSF and blood chemistry of 43 patients with a lateralized ischaemic cerebral insult was compared with that of a control group of 18 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first tests were carried out within 24 to 48 hours and 50 follow-up determinations were undertaken in the cerebral insult group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were classified according to their level of consciousness (lucid-somnolent-soporous-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Covariance analysis revealed a distinct relation between the CSF chemistry and the level of consciousness of the insult patients; accordingly, a continuous increase in the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> level from 1.54 mmol/l to 3.48 mmol/l and in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> level from 0.11 mmol/l to 0.21 mmol/l was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spearman's correlation analysis also pointed to a statistically significant correlation between decreasing levels of consciousness and the CSF <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> quotient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increase in the CSF/blood quotient of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> from 1.17 to 2.14, corresponding to the decrease in the level of consciousness, also indicates that during the early stages of the disease, cerebral tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> is reflected in the CSF rather than in the blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further subdivision of the groups according to whether the patients survived or died, showed that the critical maximum concentrations from the prognostic point of view are 2.74 +/- 0.19 mmol/l in the case of CSF <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, 0.186 +/- 0.017 in the case of CSF <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> and 1.92 +/- 0.65 for the CSF/blood quotient of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the patients with a CSF <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> level of 3.1 mmol/l or more survived the ischaemic cerebral insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, the above-mentioned parameters are to be regarded as important indicators of the threat to the patient's life </plain></SENT>
