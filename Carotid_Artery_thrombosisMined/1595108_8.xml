<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We have tested the hypothesis that platelet-derived <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> is released into the bloodstream during cerebrovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nonocclusive common carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was produced photochemically in 22 anesthetized adult male Wistar rats using the photosensitizing dye <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> and irradiation with an <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi>-pumped dye laser </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> levels were recorded before, during, and after photothrombosis by intra-arterial in vivo microdialysis with the probe placed distal to the site of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During and immediately after the common carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> levels increased significantly to a peak value of 781 nmol/l (p less than 0.001 by analysis of variance), representing a 15-fold increase compared with baseline levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0010069'>increased serotonin levels</z:mp> gradually decreased but remained significantly elevated for 90 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural analysis of the carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> identified a dense mass of aggregated platelets at various stages of degranulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results are the first to demonstrate directly that <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> accumulation occurs in plasma during and after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of common carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased plasma <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> levels may play a major role in the cerebral blood flow and blood-brain barrier abnormalities previously documented in this model of large-vessel thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
