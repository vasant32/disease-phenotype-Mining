<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ever increasing use of engineered carbon nanoparticles in nanopharmacology for selective imaging, sensor or drug delivery systems has increased the potential for blood platelet-nanoparticle interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the effects of engineered and combustion-derived carbon nanoparticles on human platelet aggregation in vitro and rat vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiplewall (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50596">MWNT</z:chebi>), singlewall (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50595">SWNT</z:chebi>) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50796">nanotubes</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33128">C60 fullerenes</z:chebi> (C60CS) and mixed carbon nanoparticles (MCN) (0.2-300 microg ml(-1)) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nanoparticles were compared with standard urban particulate matter (SRM1648, average size 1.4 microm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Platelet function was studied using lumi aggregometry, phase-contrast, immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy, flow cytometry, zymography and pharmacological inhibitors of platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was induced by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30808">ferric chloride</z:chebi> and the rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was measured, in the presence of carbon particles, with an ultrasonic flow probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Carbon particles, except C60CS, stimulated platelet aggregation (MCN&gt;or=<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50595">SWNT</z:chebi>&gt;<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50596">MWNT</z:chebi>&gt;SRM1648) and accelerated the rate of vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in rat carotid arteries with a similar rank order of efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> particles resulted in upregulation of GPIIb/IIIa in platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, particles differentially affected the release of platelet granules, as well as the activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi>-, <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>, matrix metalloproteinase- and protein kinase C-dependent pathways of aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, particle-induced aggregation was inhibited by prostacyclin and S-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>, but not by aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, some carbon nanoparticles and microparticles have the ability to activate platelets and enhance vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These observations are of importance for the pharmacological use of carbon nanoparticles and pathology of urban particulate matter </plain></SENT>
