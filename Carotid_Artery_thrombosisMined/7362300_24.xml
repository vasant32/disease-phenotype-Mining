<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Blunt carotid artery trauma is uncommon but has been associated with severe, permanent neurologic deficits in 42% and mortality in 30% of 96 patients previously reported in the English literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since neurologic symptoms characteristically develop only after a latent interval and since physical evidence of significant cervical trauma often is absent, diagnosis of nonpenetrating carotid injuries with the use of arteriography usually is delayed until the appearance of obvious, frequently irreversible neurologic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Carotid injuries should be suspected in patients who develop monoplegia or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> following blunt craniocervical trauma, particularly if computerized tomography excludes the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cumulative results of a collected series of 96 patients suggest that early surgical correction of blunt carotid injuries is appropriate for patients with transient episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in evolution, or mild completed neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
