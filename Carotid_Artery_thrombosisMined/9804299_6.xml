<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Injection of six or eight 1.5 mm clots (corresponding to 0.16 or 0.21 microl clot material) led to a variable decrease in laser Doppler flow (LDF), but did not result in reproducible <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) territory, as determined by triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining 24 h after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Injection of ten 1.5 mm clots (0.27 microl) or four 4 mm clots (0.28 microl), however, caused a persistent LDF decline to about 20-30% of baseline and led to reproducible <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> covering the entire <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The method establishes a clinically relevant, reproducible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model for the study of molecular mechanisms of ischemic brain injury in genetically engineered mice </plain></SENT>
