<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is a reasonable alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA), especially in patients at high risk for surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the treated segment is a rare, early but potentially devastating complication of this endovascular procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this article is to identify and critically review cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Previous trials that compared CEA with CAS were rather <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and not large enough to allow reliable conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, because there is limited follow-up information to date, the long-term effect of CAS remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> after angioplasty and stenting is a very rare but potentially fatal complication, and there are very few reports in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This article reviews twelve cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> published in the English literature from eight different Vascular and Radiology Departments around the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The different ways of immediate treatment of this rare complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> after CAS are, open surgical procedure with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> removal and thromboendarterectomy with or without removing of the stent, selective local or facilitated thrombolysis with the rescue use of GPIs (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors), recanalization by instent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with distal protection and additional stent placement on the stented portion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) in conjunction with the intravenous administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA: 1300,000 IU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Carotid artery stenting has to be performed under specific pro- and post procedure protocol from experienced endovascular specialists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> after CAS must be urgent and immediate in order to regain restoration of blood flow and avoid major neurological adverse events </plain></SENT>
