<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to specifically detect the localization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in vivo, we have recently developed two monoclonal antibodies (SZ-58, SZ-63) which can specifically bind to cross-linked fibrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The binding rates of the two monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to human plasma clots in vitro were 46.4 +/- 2.3% for 125I-SZ-58, 50.1 +/- 1.7% for 125I-SZ-63 and 3.4 +/- 1.6% for 125I-SZ-53 (control, MoAb against TM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was shown that both SZ-58 and SZ-63 possess properties of inhibiting the polymerization of fibrin, and SZ-58 could also inhibit the aggregation of platelets induced by <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These characteristics make the two MoAbs suitable in the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to the cross reaction tests, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in the jugular veins and carotid arteries in rabbits were made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After injection of the 125I-labeled MoAbs (100,000 cpm/ml of blood), the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> and the blood were taken and weighed at various time intervals and radioactivities were measured by an autogamma counter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ratios of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> to blood radioactivity (T/B) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in jugular veins were 3.0, 5.6 and 3.0 for 125I-SZ-58, 1.5, 3.0 and 5.2 for 125I-SZ-63 and 1.2, 1.0 and 0.7 for control (125I-SZ-53) at the 3rd, 12th and 24th hour after the injection of the radiolabled MoAbs, while the radioactivities of arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were almost the same as that in blood after the injection of the two radiotracers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it can be concluded that both SZ-58 and SZ-63 can be used in venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> imaging in vivo and the optimal times of imaging are at the 12th hour for SZ-58, 24th hour for SZ-63 after the injection of the radiolabled MoAbs </plain></SENT>
