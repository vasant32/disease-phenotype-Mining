<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this prospective study, IgG- and IgM-anticardiolipin-antibodies were determined in patients with cerebral and/or peripheral artery disease but without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>123 randomly selected patients (88 males, 35 females; mean: 65 +/- 10, range: 41-85 years) were included and divided into four groups: 18 patients with isolated cerebrovascular disease (group A), 35 patients with peripheral artery disease only (group B), 35 patients suffering from cerebral and peripheral artery disease (group C) and 35 patients as controls (group D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In family history, cholesterol, blood sugar and prothrombin time the four patient groups did not differ significantly, whereas patients of group B and C were more often smokers than those in groups A and D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, IgG-anticardiolipin-antibody-levels were significantly elevated in patients with cerebral and peripheral artery disease compared to controls (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The highest values were seen in group C where patients suffered from cerebral and peripheral artery disease (n.s.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, IgM-anticardiolipin-antibody-levels did not show any differences in the four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was no correlation between vascular risk factors and/or laboratory findings with IgG- and IgM-antibody-levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, elevated IgG-anticardiolipin-antibodies appear to be independent markers for severe cerebral and peripheral artery disease and should be determined in patients at increased risk </plain></SENT>
