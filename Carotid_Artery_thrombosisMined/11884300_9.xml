<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a rabbit model of carotid artery injury, intravenous administration of 10C12 or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> decreased <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> dose dependently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dose that resulted in a 90% reduction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> mass (ED90) was a 30-microg/kg bolus of 10C12 or a 100-U/kg bolus plus 1.0 U x kg(-1) x min(-1) infusion of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To further evaluate the effect of 10C12 on <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, it was compared with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in a novel model of blood loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the ED90 of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, blood loss induced by a standardized injury to the vasculature of the rabbit tibia increased to more than 2 times that of saline controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the dose of 10C12 required to produce a similar increase in blood loss was more than 30 times the ED90 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The antithrombotic potency and relative safety of this fully human antibody suggests that it may have therapeutic value for treatment of thrombotic disorders </plain></SENT>
