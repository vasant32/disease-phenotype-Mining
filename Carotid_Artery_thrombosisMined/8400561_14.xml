<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A signal intensity decrease of 7% +/- 3 in ischemic brain (1% +/- 2 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain) was attributable to a T2* decrease due to increased blood deoxygenation, which correlated well with subsequently measured decreases in the apparent diffusion coefficient </plain></SENT>
