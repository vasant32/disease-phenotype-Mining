<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was induced in the murine carotid artery using the photochemical reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood flow was continuously monitored and the time needed before the vessel became completely obstructed was within 11 min in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When GR144053, a platelet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, or argatroban, a thrombin inhibitor, was applied, the time required to occlusion was prolonged in a dose-dependent manner in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, when GR144053 was injected in tPA -/- mice, the most significant changes were observed: that is the estimated ED50 was 14.8 times higher than the one in tPA +/+ mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, when argatroban was injected in tPA -/- mice, the estimated ED50 was not changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Platelet aggregation, haemostasis tests and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> times were not significantly different among the different types of mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the antithrombotic effect of platelet inhibition by a GPIIb/IIIa <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, is severely affected by the absence or presence of tPA-production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the lack of tPA significantly reduces the antithrombotic efficacy </plain></SENT>
