<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To describe experience with 500 temporary balloon occlusions of the internal carotid artery, with particular emphasis on the techniques and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Temporary occlusion of the internal carotid artery was accomplished endovascularly using various balloon-catheter combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These temporary balloon occlusions were combined, when possible, with cerebral blood flow analysis with stable <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-enhanced CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complications related to this procedure occurred in 16 (3.2%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight (1.6%) patients had asymptomatic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 8 who experienced neurologic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six (1.2%) of these were transient; two (0.4%) were permanent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Temporary balloon occlusion of the internal carotid artery, believed helpful in identifying patients at risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during abrupt carotid artery sacrifice, can be performed with an acceptably low complication rate </plain></SENT>
