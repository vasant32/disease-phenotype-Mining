<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The duplex Doppler diagnosis of three internal carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was confirmed by CCDS in only one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the remaining two cases CCDS identified a marked coiling of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three low echogenic lesions, interpreted as cervical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> by conventional Doppler sonography were identified as two internal carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with partial <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007279" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="CBT1">carotid body tumour</z:e> in the third patient by CCDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Duplex-Doppler sonography and CCDS agreed in the diagnosis of two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003857,C0007772" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">AV-malformations</z:e> and one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007279" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="CBT1">carotid body tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiography confirmed the CCDS-diagnosis in 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the two patients with coiling of the ICA angiographic evaluation was not performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, CCDS was superior to duplex Doppler sonography in the evaluation of vascular lesions of the extracranial section of the carotid artery and provided additional diagnostic information </plain></SENT>
