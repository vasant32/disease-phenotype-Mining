<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011899'>hyperfibrinogenemia</z:hpo> is an independent risk factor for cerebrovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0011899'>hyperfibrinogenemia</z:hpo> could modify the histological composition of atherosclerotic plaque and precipitate carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> resulting from rupture of the plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied the histological composition of 71 carotid atherosclerotic plaques from patients who had undergone surgical endarterectomy after a first episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into 3 groups corresponding to the tertiles of plasma fibrinogen values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>Hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and smoking habit were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the histological analysis, plaques of patients in the highest tertile of fibrinogen (&gt;407 mg/dL) were characterized by a high incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (66.7% of cases) compared with plaques of subjects in the lower (21.7%) (P=0.002) and middle (29 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>2%) (P=0.009) tertiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plaque rupture was significantly associated with high fibrinogen levels (54.2%, P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression indicated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011899'>hyperfibrinogenemia</z:hpo> was an independent risk factor for a decrease in cap thickness (P=0.0005), macrophage foam cell infiltration of the cap (P=0.003), and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (P=0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When the presence of other risk factors was accounted for, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011899'>hyperfibrinogenemia</z:hpo> remained an independent predictor of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with an odds ratio of 5.83, compared with other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study add to the evidence that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011899'>hyperfibrinogenemia</z:hpo>, independently of other risk factors, is associated with a specific histological composition of carotid atherosclerotic plaques that predisposes them to rupture and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
