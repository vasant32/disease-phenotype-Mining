<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of periorbital Doppler flow and direct examination of the major neck vessels were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve subjects presented with homolateral arteriosclerotic lesions at the carotid bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ultrasonographic findings were confirmed by carotid arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High-grade stenosis or occlusion of the internal carotid artery were found in approximately 50% of the patients; the remainder turned out to have low-grade stenoses or nonstenosing plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings emphasize the role of emboli from the major neck arteries in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> and cerebral insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic effects seem to be of minor significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Continuous-wave Doppler sonography is a completely non invasive, but nevertheless reliable method for the detection of clinically relevant carotid lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Especially patients suffering from <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> insults should be examined by Doppler sonography, since they are at high risk for further cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
