<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preoperative angiography was undertaken to identify the character of the vascular lesion, study the collateral circulation, and appraise the condition of the other channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Control angiography was performed in the early (the first 2 weeks) and late-term postoperative periods (from 3 to 48 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functioning EICMA were demonstrated in the first 1-2 days in 11%, at the end of the 2nd week in 70%, and in the late-term postoperative period in 92% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparative analysis of the character of EICMA functioning depending on the collateral circulation showed them to be functioning in 80% of patients despite satisfactory development of collateral circulation along the parts of the circle of Willis through the orbital anastomosis </plain></SENT>
