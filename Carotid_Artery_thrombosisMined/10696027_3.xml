<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: First-pass contrast-enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography has become the technique of choice for studying the carotid bifurcation, but this method has some limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the clinical utility of performing 3D contrast-enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography in the axial plane immediately after performing angiography in the coronal plane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cervical carotid arteries of 80 consecutive patients were studied on a 1.5-T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imager with phased-array coils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coronal 3D <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography was performed after administering a bolus injection of contrast material (20 mL) with automatic triggering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was immediately followed by an axial acquisition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We measured carotid diameters on the contrast-enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiograms as well as on intra-arterial digital subtraction angiograms according to established criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated original source <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Angiograms obtained in the axial plane correlated better with the intra-arterial digital subtraction angiograms than did the coronal angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When first-pass contrast-enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography was incomplete because of a failure of triggering, the second-phase acquisition provided sufficient image quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Original source images suffered from ring artifacts, low axial resolution, and a low level of soft-tissue visualization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Axial-based source images showed flow-independent contrast filling to the patent lumen with sufficient visualization of plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, thickened arterial wall, and surrounding disease processes, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: With the addition of a 1-minute second-phase 3D acquisition in a different plane immediately after first-pass contrast-enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography, one can obtain a more accurate depiction of the carotid bifurcation, insurance against failure of triggering, and diagnostic source images </plain></SENT>
