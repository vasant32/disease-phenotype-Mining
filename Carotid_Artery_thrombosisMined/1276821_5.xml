<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was sudden, and the pain was severe and throbbing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After three weeks of regular four- to eight-hour attacks each day the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> gradually became less frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two months after operation they had disappeared completely </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If a predisposition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> were a precipitating factor many more cases would be expected </plain></SENT>
