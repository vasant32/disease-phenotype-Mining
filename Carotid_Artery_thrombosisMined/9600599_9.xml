<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, limited data are available in animal models concerning the response of the white matter to embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to document patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter abnormalities</z:hpo> using beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP) immunocytochemistry as a marker of axonal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve male Wistar rats underwent photochemically induced right common carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CCAT) or sham procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 3 days after CCAT, rats were perfusion-fixed and sections immunostained for the visualization of betaAPP or stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin for routine histopathological analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As previously described, CCAT produced small ipsilateral embolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and ischemic cell change within gray matter structures including the medial cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus and thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In areas of frank infarction, numerous reactive profiles were observed within borderzones of the damaged site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, betaAPP immunocytochemistry also revealed reactive axonal profiles within various white matter tracts including the corpus callosum, external capsule and fimbria of the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In many cases, the presence of axonal damage could not be appreciated with routine <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that CCAT leading to platelet embolization to the brain not only produces embolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> but also produces more subtle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Previously undetected white matter damage would be expected to participate in the sensorimotor and cognitive behavioral deficits following embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
