<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It inhibits platelet aggregation, monocyte interaction with endothelium, and smooth muscle cell <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vascular cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) is the rate-limiting step in prostacyclin synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine whether adenovirus-mediated transfer of COX-1 could restore COX-1 activity, augment prostacyclin synthesis, and prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in a porcine carotid angioplasty model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Human COX-1 cDNA driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter was constructed into a replication-defective adenovirus 5 vector by homologous recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recombinant adenovirus without a foreign gene (Ad-RR) and buffer were included as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recombinant Ad-LacZ was used for marking the transfected cells in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the in vitro experiments, cultured human endothelial cells (ECs) and porcine arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were incubated with Ad-COX-1 for 2 hours and 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26340">PGF</z:chebi>(1 alpha) level and the transgene expression were determined 72 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the in vivo experiments, recombinant adenoviruses were directly instilled into angioplasty-injured porcine carotid arteries for 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cyclic flow changes were monitored for 10 days and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation was examined histologically thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transgene expression and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">prostaglandin I2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi>) synthesis by the injured arteries were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cultured ECs infected with Ad-COX-1 produced a fivefold to eightfold increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi>, and the transgene expression in cultured porcine SMCs was demonstrated by Northern analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Direct administration of Ad-COX-1 at a dose of 3 x 10(10) pfu completely inhibited carotid cyclic flow changes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation accompanied by a fourfold increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> synthesis by the injured arteries 10 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, whereas Ad-COX-1 at a lower dose, 5 x 10(9) pfu, had no antithrombotic effects when compared with Ad-RR vector and buffer controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adenovirus-mediated transfer of COX-1 to angioplasty-injured carotid arteries was efficacious in augmenting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> synthesis and was associated with an inhibition of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> when a relatively high titer of adenovirus was instilled </plain></SENT>
