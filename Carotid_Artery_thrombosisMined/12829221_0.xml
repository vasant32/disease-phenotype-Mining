<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXEGESIS: The first case was discovered in a 31-years-old woman who complained of psychiatric manifestations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory loss</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subsequently she developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> which worsened under low dose aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second case occurred in a 41-years-old woman who presented with sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> based on angiocomputerized tomography or angioRMI data which suggested dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> location was similar: bilateral, symmetric, close to the carotid bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both women had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> risk factors: current smoking, use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> containing pill, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> and/or familial cardiovascular history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Search for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both women had been victims of intimate partner violence with repeated attempts of strangulation, but they were stopped 8 and 6 years before the diagnosis of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Several private interviews were necessary before knowing the exact cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Symmetrical bilateral <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of internal carotids near the bifurcation should lead to evoke repeated attempts of strangulation, even if there are arterial risk factors, and especially if the patient is a middle-aged female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The therapy is not codified but prolonged anticoagulation is generally prescribed </plain></SENT>
