<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this article is to study that role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty-two patients who had carotid endarterectomy and postoperative OPG/Gee were reviewed and compared with carotid arteriograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of these had bilateral and 66 had unilateral carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-nine of these patients had angiograms and three were explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total arteries studied were 98 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of these oculopneumoplethysmograms were done in the recovery room and the rest a few days to three years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> of 50% or more in diameter was considered significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 10 positive oculopneumoplethysmograms, nine of which were confirmed by angiograms; i.e., 10.0% false positive rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were also three positive oculopneumoplethysmograms which were explored in surgery and found to be thrombosed; i.e., a total of 13 positive oculopneumoplethysmograms, 12 of which were confirmed which made the real false positive rate 7.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients had positive arteriograms, nine of which had positive oculopneumoplethysmograms; i.e., 81.8% diagnostic sensitivity (9/11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eighty-four arteries were considered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> by arteriogram (11 of which had insignificant stenosis), 83 of these had negative oculopneumoplethysmograms; i.e., 98.8% diagnostic specificity (83/84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The false negative rate was 2.4% (2/85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The overall accuracy rate was 96.8% (92/95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>If the three explored arteries were added, the overall accuracy rate would be 96.9% (95/98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>To conclude, the OPG/Gee is a valuable tool in detecting immediate postendarterectomy <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or recurrent stenosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
