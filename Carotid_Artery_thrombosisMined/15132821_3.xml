<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The model of electrically stimulated carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in Sprague Dawley rats was used; the effects of copper-aspirin complex on rat platelet-neutrophil <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and platelet aggregation stimulated by activated neutrophils were observed by rosette assay and Born's method, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intragastric copper-aspirin complex (5, 7, and 10 mg/kg) dose-dependently prolonged the occlusion time; it significantly decreased the rosette number formed between thrombin-activated platelets and neutrophils; the 50 % of inhibitory concentration (IC50) was (54.6+/-4.3) micromol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Copper-aspirin complex markedly inhibited rat platelet aggregation induced by either cell free supernatant of activated neutrophils or by activated neutrophil suspension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The values of IC50 were (224.5+/-16.2) micromol/L and (820.5+/-21.4) micromol/L, whereas aspirin had no influence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Copper-aspirin complex inhibited platelet-neutrophil interactions through a different property from aspirin and resulted in a more potent antithrombotic activity </plain></SENT>
