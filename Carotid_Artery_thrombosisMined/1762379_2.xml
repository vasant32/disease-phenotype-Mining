<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with coexisting lesions were excluded from the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Out of the 57 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disorders</z:e>, a single episode of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> occurred in 33 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 24 patients with recurrent ischemic episodes, different vascular territories were involved in only six cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of a distinct distribution of vascular territories involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The left middle cerebral artery was affected in 42.9%, the right middle cerebral artery in 23.8%, the vertebrobasilar territory in 19%, and the ophthalmic arteries in 14.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in lesion localization between the group with a cardiac source of embolism and the group with ulcerations of the craniocervical vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a high frequency of patients with recurrent cardiogenic emboli in the ophthalmic (6 of 9 patients) as well as in the vertebrobasilar (6 of 12 patients) circulation who experienced a delayed initiation of cardiac assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The possibility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e> should be considered in any patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, independently of the vascular territory affected </plain></SENT>
