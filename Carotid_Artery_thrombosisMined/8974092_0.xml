<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 53-year-old man, complaining of progressive disturbance of consciousness and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>, was admitted to our department at about 7 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CT demonstrated no abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Digital subtraction angiography revealed an occlusion of the right cervical internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After intra-arterial injection of t-PA, a guide wire was able to be passed through the artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recanalization of internal carotid artery was performed by rescue <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> with Stealth FS angioplastic balloons of small diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Residual stenosis ratio was about 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After rescue <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>, his symptoms improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the following day, deferred <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> with Stealth FS angioplastic balloons of larger diameter was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stenosis ratio was 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After the procedure, his palsy was relieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DSA in the 3rd week after the <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> revealed that the stenosis ratio had changed from 30% to 13% </plain></SENT>
