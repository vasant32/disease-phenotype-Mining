<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, their effect on hemostasis has not been studied extensively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the effects on hemostasis of bovine-derived <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> solution (HBOC-201) with gelatin solution and saline infusion in an experimental model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After anesthesia, the Folts model was constructed in 30 rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The common carotid artery was exposed, and a 60% stenosis was induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A compression injury of the artery was then produced, which triggered a series of cyclic episodes of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (cyclic flow reductions [CFRs]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the number of baseline CFRs was counted, animals were assigned randomly to one of three groups (n = 10 each): saline (control), gelatin, or HBOC-201 solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect of studied solutions was observed by recording the number of CFRs during another period and was compared with that of saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ear immersion <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time was recorded after each CFR period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gelatin and HBOC-201 had similar effects, manifested by significantly decreased CFRs (from median of 7 to 1 and 6 to 1, respectively) and significantly lengthened <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time (from 88 to 98 s and 81 to 102 s, respectively; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Saline infusion had no significant effect on CFRs or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>HBOC-201 and gelatin had similar effects marked by a reduction in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> rate and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003010'>increased bleeding time</z:hpo> in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS: In a rabbit <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and hemorrhagic model, a polymerized bovine-derived <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> solution and a gelatin solution infusion decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> and lengthened <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time </plain></SENT>
