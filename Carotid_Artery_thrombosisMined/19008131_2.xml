<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Sustained embolisation after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) predicts an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to post-operative carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (POCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Progression towards <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> can be prevented by transcranial Doppler (TCD) directed intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, TCD monitoring is extremely labour intensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to see whether a small cohort of high-risk patients could be identified following a 30-min period of monitoring in the Recovery Area of the operating theatre so as to reduce the overall burden of monitoring for the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective audit of prospectively acquired data in 821 patients with an accessible temporal window who had undergone 3h of TCD monitoring after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with &gt;25 emboli in any 10 min period or large emboli distorting the waveform received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Group 1: 694 patients (85%) with &lt;or=10 emboli detected within the first 30 min in the Recovery Area of the operating theatre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recovery: None required <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran</z:chebi>, none suffered a proven ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and none were re-explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Group 2: 127 patients (15%) with 11+ emboli detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, 26 (20%) required <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran</z:chebi> (54% had the dose increased to control excessive embolisation), none suffered a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to POCT, but 2 suffered embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> despite <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both, however, had mitigating reasons why optimal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran</z:chebi> doses could not be administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TCD directed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran</z:chebi> has abolished <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to POCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A high-risk cohort of patients requiring <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran</z:chebi> can be identified by measuring the magnitude of embolisation in the first 30 min in Theatre Recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of patients (85%) require no further monitoring </plain></SENT>
