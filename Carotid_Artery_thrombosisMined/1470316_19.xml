<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion was performed in rats at temporalis muscle temperatures of 30 degrees C, 33 degrees C, 34.5 degrees C and 36.5 degrees C (n = 10, 8, 10, and 13, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The animals were kept at the desired temperature for 1 hour and rewarmed to 36.5 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a separate group of animals (n = 11), the temperature was decreased to 33 degrees C 1 hour after performing the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> at normothermia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These animals were rewarmed to 36.5 degrees C after another hour with side by side controls (n = 9) kept at 36.5 degrees C throughout the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, rats were killed and the percentage of infarcted right hemisphere was determined in coronal brain sections with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of infarcted volume at 30 degrees C, 33 degrees C, and 34.5 degrees C (9.3 +/- 2.1%, 8.2 +/- 2.2%, and 8.4 +/- 2.2%) (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) was significantly smaller than at 36.5 degrees C (19.6 +/- 1.6%, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the hypothermic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When rats were cooled to 33 degrees C 1 hour after the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp>, the percentage of infarcted volume was also significantly smaller than the control group (8.0 +/- 1.8% vs. 17.4 +/- 2.1%) (P &lt; 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
