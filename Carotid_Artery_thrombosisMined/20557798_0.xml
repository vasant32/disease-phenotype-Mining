<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven such patients were treated with self-expandable covered stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated immediate and delayed complications by assessing clinical and imaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Technical success and immediate hemostasis were achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immediate complications were noted in four patients (36.4%), including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in three patients and, in one patient, dissection of the carotid artery and type III endoleak by the overlapped self-expandable stent causing rebleeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Delayed complications were noted in eight patients (72.7%), including six episodes of rebleeding in five patients, distal marginal stenosis in five patients, and delayed carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in three patients (one with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> formation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We suggest close follow-up of the patients and aggressive re-intervention of their complications to improve outcomes </plain></SENT>
