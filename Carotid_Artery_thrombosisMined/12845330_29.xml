<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After intravenous injection, the fibrinolytic activity of RBC-tPA persisted in the bloodstream at least tenfold longer than did that of free tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> induced by intravenously injected fibrin microemboli aggregating in pulmonary vasculature, soluble tPA lysed pulmonary clots lodged before but not after tPA injection, whereas the converse was true for RBC-tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Free tPA failed to lyse occlusive carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> whether injected before or after vascular trauma, whereas RBC-tPA circulating before, but not injected after, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation restored blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This RBC-based drug delivery strategy alters the fibrinolytic profile of tPA, permitting prophylactic fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
