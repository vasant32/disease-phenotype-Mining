<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Out of 200 patients examined by Doppler ultrasound 60 patients underwent carotid angiography and the angiographic data were compared with the noninvasive results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic accuracy was 85% in cases with stenoses greater than 50% and occlusions; in cases with stenoses of greater than 50% it was 78% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Occlusions could always be verified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Doppler ultrasound is very valuable for follow-up examinations after reconstructive procedures of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 30 patients we were able to objectively document the normalisation of circulation in successfully operated cases by pre- and post-operative examinations </plain></SENT>
