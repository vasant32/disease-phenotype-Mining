<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients comprised seven per cent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> treated in 1966-73 at the Department of Neurology, University of Helsinki </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period of 3 to 86 months (median 50 months) five patients died, three during the first, and two during the second year of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the surviving patients: two needed institutionalization; three were able to take care of themselves; and four who were virtually symptom-free, were able to work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk factors of cerebrovascular disease were analysed: 91 per cent were cigarette smokers; 70 per cent had serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> of 140 mg/100ml or higher; and 62 per cent had cholesterol values of 280 mg/100 ml or higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values higher than 95 mg/100 ml, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> were encountered in every third, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in every fourth patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cigarette smoking and high <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> were more prevalent than in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No association between the number of risk factors in the individual patients and the prognosis could be found </plain></SENT>
