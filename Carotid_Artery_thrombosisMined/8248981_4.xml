<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Photochemical techniques, currently used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> research, produce endothelial damage and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further characterize these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> and to determine whether they embolize, we studied the ultrastructure of photochemically damaged carotid arteries and small vessels distal to the irradiated carotid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The right carotid artery of 9 Wistar rats was irradiated with a laser (632 nm, 200 mW/cm2, 15 minutes) after the injection of the photosensitizing dye Photofrin II, 12.5 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 6 additional control rats: laser only, 2 rats; dye only, 2; carrier only (5% <z:chebi fb="10" ids="4167">dextrose</z:chebi>), 1; and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The carotid artery and cerebral arterioles were studied using scanning and transmission electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endothelial damage was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> irradiated carotid arteries, and consisted of exposure of the subendothelium and the formation of a nonocclusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although most cerebral arterioles were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, 32 of these vessels contained peripheral blood elements, with platelet or red blood cell aggregates present in 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The endothelium adjacent to the aggregates was intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A few scattered endothelial cells had been lost in the carotid artery of control animals (compatible with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cell turnover), with a few platelets adhering to the exposed subendothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aggregates of blood cells and platelets in cerebral vessels in the absence of endothelial denudation verifies embolism as the mechanism for cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> in this experimental model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The possibility of embolization distal to the site of photochemical irradiation has implications for potential applications of photochemistry for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment and the ablation of vascular malformations and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
