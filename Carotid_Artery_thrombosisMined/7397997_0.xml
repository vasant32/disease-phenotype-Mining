<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More recently, internal carotid artery stump pressure has been proposed as a simpler and equally reliable indicator of possible inadequate cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, stump pressure measurements and EEG changes were compared in 80 carotid endarterectomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean stump pressure for patients with ischemic EEG changes was 58 mm Hg, vs 66 mm Hg for those without EEG alterations (not statistically significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 17 patients with definite ischemic EEG changes had stump pressure greater than 59 mm Hg, a value generally equated with adequate cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EEG interpretations and stump pressure predictions did not agree in 18 of 80 patients (22.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stump pressure measurements should be used with caution as the sole monitor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and need for intraluminal shunting </plain></SENT>
