<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A study has been performed using a canine model to investigate the healing response to carotid endarterectomy and the validity of an in vivo <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">indium</z:chebi>-111 (In-111) radiotracer technique in the assessment of postendarterectomy deposition of autologous labelled platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixteen endarterectomized carotid arteries showed uptake of autologous In-111 platelets immediately after infusion, reaching a maximum by 1 hour with little increase at 24 or 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No uptake was seen in ten control vessels following platelet infusion (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At autopsy, seven vessels were demonstrated to have In-111 platelet deposition immediately prior to sacrifice of the animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postmortem scanning confirmed the localization to the vessel lumens, and microscopy revealed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation with or without partial endothelialization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete reendothelialization had occurred in the vessels that failed to show platelet deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Delayed healing was associated with continuing platelet deposition, excessive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Arteriotomy closure with a vein patch altered the healing characteristics of the vessel with segmental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation over the vein patch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A preliminary study of the postendarterectomy in vivo In-111 platelet response in humans demonstrated platelet deposition that was not influenced by the administration of antiplatelet drugs at currently prescribed levels </plain></SENT>
