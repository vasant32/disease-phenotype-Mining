<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the impact of previous medication on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> following intra-arterial revascularization therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients receiving intra-arterial reperfusion therapy after an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intracranial occlusion were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Premorbid use of antiplatelets, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>, oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi> and oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Collateral pial circulation (CPC) was scored on initial angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 118 patients were included (mean age 70.4 Â± 11 years, 45% female) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>66 patients (56%) were cardioembolic, 30 (25%) atherothrombotic, and 22 (19%) other/unknown etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant impact of medication was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the series or cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, relevant differences were found among atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The previous use of antiplatelets was associated with smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (64 vs. 170 ml; p = 0.043) whereas premorbid <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> predicted reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (64 vs. 215 ml; p = 0.019), clinical improvement (79 vs. 29%; p = 0.016) and good CPC (100 vs. 20%; p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statins</z:chebi> were the only medication independently predicting reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and clinical improvement and this effect depended on CPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Previous use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> may preferentially benefit patients with atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> by favoring the development of CPC </plain></SENT>
