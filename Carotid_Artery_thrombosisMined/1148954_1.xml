<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ten patients have been described showing inability to stop breathing on command, spontaneous respiration and voluntary respiratory stimulation being unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This abnormality not previously described in the literature, we feel should be named respiratory inhibitory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002186'>apraxia</z:hpo> (R.I.A.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The anatomical organization of respiration is briefly reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>R.I.A. is often associated with other forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002186'>apraxia</z:hpo> or motor impersistence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is thought that the urinary and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002607'>bowel incontinence</z:hpo> present in some of these cases might also represent a form of inhibitory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002186'>apraxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Information is presented which supports the view that respiratory inhibitory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002186'>apraxia</z:hpo> is due to a minor hemisphere lesion, usually deepseated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our one autopsied case showed a lesion in the descending motor pathways in the internal capsule, in middle cerebral artery branch territory, disconnecting the voluntary respiratory inhibitory center in the cortex in anterior and middle cerebral cortical branch territories </plain></SENT>
