<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have implemented preparations for evolving both platelet-rich and fibrin-rich <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> simultaneously in rabbits for use to define the efficacy of novel antithrombotic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For platelet-rich <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, a carotid artery and contralateral jugular vein were dissected and an arteriovenous shunt inserted distally to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The shunted artery was then instrumented with a proximal Doppler probe for measuring flow velocity and a distal transluminal needle electrode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electrical injury to the artery was induced by application of 250 microA of anodal current to the indwelling needle electrode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic occlusion was consistently observed within 60 min, permitting measurements of the effects on the incidence and time of occlusion of antithrombotic agents administered over 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For fibrin-rich <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, an external jugular vein was dissected, including the distal bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of the branches was catheterized and a copper wire with cotton threads attached was advanced through the catheter into the superior vena cava, allowing exposure of the threads to flowing blood </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Implementing both arterial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> simultaneously did not change measurements compared with either method alone </plain></SENT>
