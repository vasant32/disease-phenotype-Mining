<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, the effect of other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective review of carotid endarterectomy results spanning 10 years, encompassing 561 patients, and reporting the combined results of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> surgeons at our institution was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were assigned to one of four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 227 patients with no preoperative risks (Group 1), 61 with angiographic risks (Group 2), 196 with medical risks with or without angiographic risks (Group 3), and 77 with neurological risks with or without medical/angiographic risks (Group 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other risks associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurrence were recorded including: intraoperative risks (cross-clamp time, use of shunt, use of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> solutions), surgical complications (carotid occlusion/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> or ligation), and medical complications (<z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> incidence was 5% with 2% (11 patients) and 3.4% (19 patients) having good and poor outcomes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> incidence was highest in Groups 2 and 4 (10 and 14%, respectively), and Group 4 had the highest incidence of poor-outcome <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cross-clamp time, intraoperative shunt placement, and intraoperative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> administration were similar among preoperative risk groups and were not primary determinants of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common medical complication was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, which had the highest incidence in Groups 3 and 4 (6.1 and 5%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The highest incidence of surgical complications occurred in Groups 2 and 4, carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> being the most common event (16 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Surgical complications were more commonly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than were medical complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
