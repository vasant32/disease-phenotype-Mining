<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The use of cerebral angiography (ANGIO) to select patients for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been limited by concern about the risk of complications of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors sought to determine the rate of neurologic complications at both an academic medical center (AMC) and a community hospital (CH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors reviewed the records of 569 patients undergoing ANGIO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Any documentation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, transient neurologic event, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurring in the 24 hours after the procedure was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rate of neurologic complications at the AMC and CH were compared to published studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall complication rate was 0.5% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 0.4% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between the AMC and CH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> was of moderate severity and four of the five patients with complications subsequently underwent endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The rate of major neurologic complications due to ANGIO may be lower than expected, even when performed in a non-academic setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Awareness of local ANGIO complication rates is important when selecting patients for CEA </plain></SENT>
