<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only 5 of 615 consecutive patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were 1 man and 4 women aged 50 to 75 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiography disclosed occlusion of the M2 tract in one, of the M3 tract in one, of the carotid siphon in one of M4 tract in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intraarterial urokinase was infused at a mean dosage of 560,000 units close to the site of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four of them had partial or complete recanalisation at early angiographic control and were independent at 6th month control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The one who did not demonstrate recanalisation was confined to a wheelchair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient, who had recanalisation, sustained a hemorrhagic transformation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> not interfering with outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our experience, at the light of the low rate of enrollment, despite the results, suggest that intraarterial thrombolysis may be a therapeutic tool for selected patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the carotid artery territories and not a routinary treatment for them </plain></SENT>
