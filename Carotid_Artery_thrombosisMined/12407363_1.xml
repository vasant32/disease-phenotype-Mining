<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) may be a result of intraoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, embolism, or <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> at the operative site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative duplex should eliminate the occurrence of a severe internal carotid artery (ICA) <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and, thus, negate the benefit of reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This article will detail the results of our evolving treatment algorithm for immediate versus delayed post-CEA neurologic deficit (ND) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied patients who had an ND after CEA from 1988 to 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients (3.2%) had a post-CEA ND (26 related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, 6 other); 31 had a satisfactory intraoperative duplex post-CEA, 1 was not tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients awoke from operation with a related deficit, 5 of whom were re-explored and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had a patent ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient without lateralizing signs who was not re-explored had extensive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> at postmortem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remaining 9 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had a duplex-proven patent ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had a lucid interval before their related ND </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six patients were re-explored and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had thrombosed ICAs; 5 of the 6 improved postthrombectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four patients were not re-explored for various reasons; a carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was not later diagnosed in any of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative and postoperative duplex has modified our treatment of post-CEA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No longer are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients re-explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intraoperative duplex who awaken with an immediate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> do not usually have occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and routine re-exploration does not benefit these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients who have an ND develop after a lucid period may have a thrombosed ICA despite a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intraoperative duplex, and unless there is a timely <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> duplex, re-exploration is recommended and appears to benefit these patients </plain></SENT>
