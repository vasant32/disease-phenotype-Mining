<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Improved methods of identifying patients at high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> would allow improved targeting of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One such situation is carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which can be reduced by carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the risk-benefit ratio is low in patients with tight asymptomatic stenosis and moderate symptomatic stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> is believed to be embolic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the detection of asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> using Doppler ultrasound may allow identification of a high-risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transcranial Doppler ultrasound was used to record for 1 hour the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery in 111 patients with &gt;60% carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (69 symptomatic, 42 asymptomatic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Doppler audio signal was recorded onto digital audio tape for later analysis for embolic signals (ES) by an individual blinded to clinical details </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 67 subjects the relationship between ES and angiographically determined plaque ulceration was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were followed up prospectively, and the relationship between ES and risk of future ipsilateral carotid artery territory ischemic events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ES were detected in 41(36.9%) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In symptomatic patients there was a significant inverse relationship between the number of ES per hour and time elapsed since last symptoms (Spearman's rho=-0.2558, P=0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ES were more common in subjects with plaque ulceration, with a relative risk of 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>94 (95% CI, 1.23 to 19.84; P=0.025) after controlling for both symptomatic status and degree of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The presence of ES at entry was predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk during follow up in both symptomatic (P=0.02) and asymptomatic patients (P=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Considering <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 111 patients, the presence of asymptomatic embolization was predictive of a further ischemic event, with an adjusted OR of 8.10 (95% CI, 1.58 to 41.57; P=0.01) after controlling for other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, degree of stenosis, symptomatic status, and aspirin or <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic embolization in patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> correlates with known markers of increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk and is an independent predictor of future <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk in patients with both symptomatic and asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It may allow identification of a high-risk group of patients who will particularly benefit from carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>A large multicenter study is now required to confirm these findings </plain></SENT>
