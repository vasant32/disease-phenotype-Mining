<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rabbits were anesthetized and prepared to record arterial pressure, heart rate, and carotid blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A critical stenosis of a damaged carotid artery was obtained using an external plastic cylinder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complete occlusion occurred within 6 to 12 minutes, as measured by the decrease in blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both stenosis of the vessel and deliberate damage (clamping by surgical forceps) were found essential to occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Occlusion was prevented by administration of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (200 IU/kg), tissue plasminogen activator (300 micrograms/kg), iloprost (10 micrograms/kg) or the synthetic thrombin inhibitor, FPRCH2Cl (0.5 mg/kg), while <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> (100 mg/kg) was uneffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The procedure permits an easy and rapid evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation and of anti-thrombotic drugs affecting the hemostatic process </plain></SENT>
