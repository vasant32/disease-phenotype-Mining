<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cross sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Teaching hospital, England </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients: a random consecutive series of 23 patients in part I, 19 in part II and 77 in part III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Part I: twenty-three images of carotid bifurcation plaques from 2 duplex scanners were digitised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Images were standardised by 4 observers so that the grey scale median (GSM) would be 0-5 for blood and 185-195 for adventitia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Part II: the effect of three different recording media: video, magneto-optical disk (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MOD</z:e>) and thermal paper on the echodensity of 19 plaques' images was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Part III: the echodensity of 91 carotid bifurcation plaques with greater than 50% stenosis was correlated to the presence or absence of ipsilateral hemispherical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Part I: the coefficient of variation (CV) among 4 observers was 0.7%, 0% and 4.7% after image standardisation for the adventitia, blood and plaques respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Part II: a near perfect agreement was obtained between the GSM of plaques from images on video and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MOD</z:e> (r = 0.97) after standardisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Part III: after standardisation, the GSM of symptomatic plaques was lower (21 +/- 14.8) than in asymptomatic plaques (38 +/- 26) p = 0.002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Plaque echolucency was more likely to be associated with symptoms (relative risk 4.1 90% CI 1.8-9.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Images from different scanners by different ultrasonographers and through different peripherals can be standardised so that measurements of plaque echodensity may become comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The method is recommended for use in future natural history studies on carotid plaques where <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is the end-point </plain></SENT>
