<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases an anastomosis between the superficial temporal artery (STA) and a cortical temporal branch of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This resulted in a considerable additional blood supply from the external carotid to the affected middle cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The extent of the territory of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> irrigated by the STA depends upon the different anatomical configurations of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a considerable improvement in neurological status even in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A topographical correlation between the postoperative angiographically identified increase of rCBF and the recovery or considerable improvement of neurological functions was not ascertained </plain></SENT>
