<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of rats with either SB 249417 (3.0 mg/kg, i. v.) or enoxaparin (30.0 mg/kg, i.v. or s.c.) resulted in comparable and significant reductions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the efficacious dose of enoxaparin resulted in &gt;30-fold increase in the aPTT over baseline, while the efficacious dose of SB 249417 prolonged the aPTT by only approximately 3-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, pretreatment with SB 249417 resulted in sustained blood flow and arterial patency throughout the experiment in &gt;80% of rats treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, &lt;30% of rats pretreated with enoxaparin remained patent throughout the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data in this report indicate that the selective inhibition of factor IX(a) with the monoclonal antibody SB 249417 produces a superior antithrombotic profile to that of the low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> enoxaparin </plain></SENT>
