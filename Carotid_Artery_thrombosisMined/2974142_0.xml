<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a continuous series of 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> associated with contralateral occlusion, the possibility of substitute blood flow during clamping of the stentic vessel was evaluated by intra-operative measurement of carotid back pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the 7 patients whose back pressure was higher than 40 mmHg, endarterectomy of the carotid bifurcation was performed in 6 cases and reimplantation for stenosing loop in 1 case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the 7 patients whose carotid back pressure was lower than 40 mmHg, a carotid-carotid bypass was performed, the first anastomosis always being on the common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No post-operative neurological accident was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This technique seems to be preferable to a shunt, which is not always feasible, notably in cases with high bifurcation </plain></SENT>
