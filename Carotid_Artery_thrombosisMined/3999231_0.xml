<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Oculopneumoplethysmography (OPG-Gee) was performed pre- and postoperatively in 100 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy and 14 patients undergoing nonendarterectomy procedures (aortofemoral or carotid-subclavian bypass) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Absolute differences in ocular systolic pressure (OSP) were determined and results were compared with previous criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve examinations yielded abnormal findings in the endarterectomy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had associated neurologic deficits and six had occlusion confirmed at reexploration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients were without symptoms; two with profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depressions</z:hpo> in OSP were reexplored and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> confirmed whereas three with moderate (15 to 30 mm Hg) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depressions</z:hpo> in OSP were followed up and remained asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Values of OSP were related to the status of the contralateral carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the nonendarterectomized patients OSP did not change with general anesthesia or carotid clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>OPG-Gee is a useful test to screen for postoperative carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It helps select symptomatic patients with occlusions who might benefit from early reexploration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In asymptomatic patients a profound drop in OSP identifies early occlusion and may be used alone or in concert with angiography to select patients for reoperation </plain></SENT>
