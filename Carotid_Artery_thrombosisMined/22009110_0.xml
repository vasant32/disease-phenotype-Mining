<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Further, thrombolysis study was also performed to evaluate the therapeutic activity of the prepared liposomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Liposomes were prepared by film hydration method and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was subsequently conjugated on the preformed liposomes using carbodiimide chemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prepared liposomes were characterized for size and size distribution, entrapment efficiency and in vitro drug release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro targeting ability of the liposomes was determined by platelets binding assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo studies were performed in the rat model containing human blood clot inoculated in the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results of the study showed that RGD <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> conjugated liposomes significantly accumulated to the site of blood clot and higher thrombolytic activity was observed with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> modified liposomes as compared to plain streptokinase solution and long circulatory liposomes </plain></SENT>
