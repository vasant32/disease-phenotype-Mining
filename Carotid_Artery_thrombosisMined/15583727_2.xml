<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Factor Xa inhibitors and GPIIb/IIIa <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> have shown to be effective on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and late neointima formation, however, their combined effects remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vascular injury was induced by FeCl(3) in the carotid artery in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> studies, the test drug was orally administered 1 hour before vascular injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For neointima studies, the test drug was orally administered 1 hour before and twice daily for 1 week after vascular injury, and then histological analysis was performed 3 weeks after vascular injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>YM466 inhibited thrombotic occlusion at 30 mg/kg with prolongation of prothrombin time (PT), and tail transection <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time (BT) was affected at 100 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>YM466 also inhibited neointima formation at 10 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>YM128 inhibited thrombotic occlusion and neointima formation at 10 and 30 mg/kg, respectively, with inhibition of platelet aggregation and prolongation of BT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the combination of 10 mg/kg YM466 and 3 mg/kg YM128 inhibited thrombotic occlusion and neointima formation without affecting PT, platelet aggregation and BT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Concomitant inhibition of factor Xa and GPIIb/IIIa may provide a safer and more effective therapeutic regimen for treatment of coronary angioplasty </plain></SENT>
