<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pilot studies using early thrombolytic therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have suggested that recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA) might be effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While large, double-blind, randomized studies are needed, open trials could generate hypotheses concerning (1) the clinical correlations of outcome, (2) the significance of CT scan data during the first week, and (3) the use of adjunctive therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed an open trial of intravenous rTPA on patients referred to our emergency service with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the carotid territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients between 20 and 81 years hospitalized during 1994 with completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the internal carotid artery territory and a baseline Scandinavian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score lower than 48, even with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0004372'>disturbances of consciousness</z:hpo>, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inclusion time was within 7 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 0.8-mg/kg dose of rTPA was infused for 90 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was given either immediately at efficient dosage or after 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">Mannitol</z:chebi> was used in patients with severe presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Scandinavian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale evaluation was done at baseline, 3 hours, and 1, 7, 30, and 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The CT scan was performed before the treatment and at days 1 (24 +/- 6 hours) and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-three consecutive patients met the criteria of the protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean age at inclusion was 65 +/- 10.4 years, and the mean interval to treatment was 232 +/- 79 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At day 90, 25 patients (58.1%) exhibited a complete regression of symptoms, and 3 had moderate neurological sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients had severe neurological sequelae, 11 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and 2 with secondary parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Two patients died (4.6%), 1 with <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The overall <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> rate was 6.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Excellent outcome at day 90 was significantly correlated with major neurological improvement at day 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Intravenous immediate <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> versus delayed <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> after 24 hours improved the ischemic outcome but not the overall outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Reinfarction syndromes after major neurological improvement, likely to be rethrombosis syndromes, were observed in 3 patients (6.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>For the day 1 CT scan, poor outcome was associated with the presence of structured and homogeneous hypodensities likely to represent classic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, as confirmed by day 7 CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Conversely, total recovery was significantly associated with the absence of any image or with unstructured hypodensities, a particular type of image characterized by its <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> darkness and often polylobar shape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>This type of image disappeared at day 7 in 17.6% of the cases and is likely to represent reperfusion images and/or incomplete ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this open, small study suggest safety and effectiveness of rTPA thrombolysis at the dose of 0.8 mg/kg within 7 hours in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> of the carotid territory, including highly serious baseline neurological presentations, until age 81 years and under special therapeutic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Complete recovery is significantly associated with major neurological improvement during the first 24 hours and the presence of a particular type of image at day 1 CT scan characterized by an unstructured hypodensity, often polylobar and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, which is likely to correspond to reperfusion images </plain></SENT>
