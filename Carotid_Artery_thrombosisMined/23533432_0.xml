<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present this case to report the occurrence of postoperative cervical <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> complicated by ipsilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> after an uncomplicated C4-6 ACDF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is a case of a 65-year-old woman who underwent revision fusions of the C4-5 and C6-7 levels complicated by postoperative cervical <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> and carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient's history, clinical examination, imaging findings, and treatment are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The revision fusions were performed and deemed routine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Approximately eight hours later 200â€‰mL of blood was evacuated from a postoperative cervical <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient became unresponsive and disoriented a few hours after evacuating the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated total occlusion of the left carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thrombectomy was performed and the patient was discharged without residual deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the latest followup she is fully functional and asymptomatic in her neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We suggest, after evacuating a cervical <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, an evaluation of the carotids be made with MRA or cerebral angiography, as this may demonstrate a clot before the patient develops symptoms </plain></SENT>
