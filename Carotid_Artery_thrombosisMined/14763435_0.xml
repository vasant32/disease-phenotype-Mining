<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Carotid lesions require priority in both evaluation and treatment due to their high morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Controversy about therapeutic behavior in these patients with or without central neurological deficit is still under in discussion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To present a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> due to a shotgun wound and discuss its therapeutic behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Hospital de Urgencias in CÃ³rdoba city </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 15-year-old male patient is presented with a "point-blank" shotgun wound in the soft parts of the left cervical region, and a left carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with no central neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Wound toilette and carotid revascularization by means of resection and venous by-pass with external carotid ligature was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The procedure was finished by delaging for plastic reconstruction of the cervical injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Carotid postoperative angiographic control showed good permeability with no carotid flow alteration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Penetrating carotid injuries should be resolved, if technically possible, with revascularization of the carotid sector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This procedure has to be aborted if the patient is in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> or the lesion is difficult to repair, in such a case ligature should be carried out </plain></SENT>
