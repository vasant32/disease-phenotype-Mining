<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present work focused on the structural characterization of a new <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24500">heparan</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> (HS)-like polymer isolated from the mollusk Nodipecten nodosus (Linnaeus, 1758) and on its <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and antithrombotic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> were extracted from the mollusk and fractionated by <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> precipitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main component (&gt;90%) was identified as HS-like <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycan</z:chebi>, representing approximately 4.6 mg g(-1) of dry tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mollusk HS resists degradation with heparinase I but is cleaved by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25567">nitrous acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the mollusk glycan by one-dimensional (1)H, two-dimensional correlated spectroscopy, and heteronuclear single quantum coherence nuclear magnetic resonance revealed characteristic signals of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24298">glucuronic acid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">glucosamine</z:chebi> residues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Signals corresponding to anomeric protons of nonsulfated, 3- or 2-sulfated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24298">glucuronic acid</z:chebi> as well as N-sulfated and/or 6-sulfated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">glucosamine</z:chebi> were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mollusk HS has an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity of 36 IU mg(-1), 5-fold lower than porcine <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (180 IU mg(-1)), as measured by the activated partial thromboplastin time assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It also inhibits factor Xa (IC(50) = 0.835 microg ml(-1)) and thrombin (IC(50) = 9.3 microg ml(-1)) in the presence of antithrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In vivo assays demonstrated that at the dose of 1 mg kg(-1), the mollusk HS inhibited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> growth in photochemically injured arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> effect, factor XIIa-mediated kallikrein activity, or toxic effect on fibroblast cells was induced by the invertebrate HS at the antithrombotic dose </plain></SENT>
