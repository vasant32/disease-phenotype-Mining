<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test the safety and efficiency of commercially available thrombectomy catheters in clearing simulated internal carotid artery (ICA) <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Comparative in vitro study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A model of the ICA was filled with human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, the 'circle of Willis' back pressure was set at either 10 or 30 cm of water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five thrombectomy devices (Hydrolyser, Clot Buster, Acolysis System, AngioJet and Fogarty embolectomy catheter) were compared for (i) efficiency at removing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, (ii) pressure changes at the tip of each device, and (iii) distal embolisation by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Thrombus</z:e> clearance was greatest with the AngioJet (median 95%, range 92-97%) and least with the Acolysis System (median 34%, range 12-50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Clot Buster and Hydrolyser were safest as they produced only negative tip pressures, the AngioJet and Balloon catheter produced positive and negative pressures risking distal embolisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Acolysis system produced no pressure change during use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Distal embolisation (of particles between 5 and 40 microm diameter) was greatest with the Fogarty balloon catheter at 10 cm water (P&lt;0.05) and least with the Hydrolyser and Clot Buster </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Balloon embolectomy for ICA <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> risks further embolic cerebral damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Hydrolyser and the Clot Buster show the greatest promise for ICA thrombectomy </plain></SENT>
