<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The maximum velocity estimator is based on the principle of frequency variable filtering controlled by a feedback loop to follow the velocity spectrum envelope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Findings by Doppler and bilateral selective carotid arteriography in 216 patients were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid stenoses</z:e> were identified by the finding of a vessel segment with locally increased flow velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Peak Velocity Ratio (PVR) was calculated from maximum velocities measured in the stenosis and in more distal Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using PVR, ICA stenoses greater than 20% were detected with sensitivity 96%, specificity 94%, positive accuracy 94% and negative accuracy 96% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total ICA occlusions were identified with sensitivity 97% and specificity 99% </plain></SENT>
