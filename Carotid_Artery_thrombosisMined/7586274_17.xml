<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The thrombolytic properties of a new variant of tissue plasminogen activator (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) (T103N, N117Q, KHRR 296-299 AAAA, or TNK-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) with longer plasma half-life, greater fibrin specificity, and increased resistance to inhibition by plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) were investigated in a rabbit thrombosed carotid artery model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: After 60 minutes of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> (1.5, 3.0, 6.0, or 9.0 mg/kg as a front-loaded IV infusion for 90 minutes; n = 22) or TNK-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> (0.38, 0.75, or 1.5 mg/kg as IV bolus; n = 16) was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood flow through the artery was monitored for an additional 120 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Bleeding</z:mp> was assessed by weighing the amount of blood absorbed in a gauze pad placed in a subcutaneous muscular incision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recanalization rates and duration of recanalization were dose dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The doses that produced &gt; 80% recanalization rates with the longest duration of recanalization were 9.0 mg/kg for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> and 1.5 mg/kg for TNK-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At these doses, time to reperfusion (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) was significantly faster (11 +/- 2 versus 23 +/- 7 minutes) and duration of recanalization longer (77 +/- 9 versus 51 +/- 18 minutes) for TNK-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> compared with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> (P &lt; .025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Weights of the residual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> group were greater than those of the TNK-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> group (P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of fibrinogen, plasminogen, and alpha 2-antiplasmin at 120 minutes were significantly higher for TNK-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>-treated animals compared with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>-treated animals (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ANOVA of the blood loss data determined that there were significant differences between thrombolytic agents but not between doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After correction for saline controls, total blood loss for pooled doses of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> and TNK-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> was 82 +/- 6 mg and 40 +/- 4 mg, respectively (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: From these data, we conclude that TNK-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>, given as a bolus, produces faster and more complete recanalization of occluded arteries in a rabbit experimental model compared with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>, without increasing systemic plasmin generation or peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, we observed that TNK-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>, unlike <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>, did not potentiate collagen-induced aggregation of platelets obtained from human plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This lack of effect on platelet aggregation by TNK-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> potentially could be associated with a decreased risk of reocclusion after successful thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
