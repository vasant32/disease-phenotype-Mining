<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the events leading to this incidence is <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the endarterectomized internal carotid artery (ICA) after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since antiplatelet drugs have been found to be effective in altering platelet-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, we undertook a clinical trial of administration of aspirin (or aspirin-like) drugs to a group of patients who were to undergo ICA endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This group was then compared to a comparable group from the previous year in whom drugs had not been administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> occurred on six occasions in five patients in the group that did not receive drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> was not observed in two patients exhibiting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> in the drugs group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these results, we concluded that the incidence of neurological complications following carotid reconstructive surgery can be further reduced by the use of aspirin and aspirin-like drugs </plain></SENT>
