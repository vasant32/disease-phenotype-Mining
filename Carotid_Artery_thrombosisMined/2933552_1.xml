<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 412 patients were divided into 5 groups according to their clinical symptoms: Group I: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo>; group II: occlusions of the central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery; group III: venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_105'>circulatory disorders</z:mpath> of the retina; group IV: AION and optic disk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>; group V: symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ocular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DUSG disclosed a high percentage of additional carotid lesions in groups I and II </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to this, DUSG furnished valuable diagnostic information in arteritic AION, where nearly 50% of DUSG findings were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Carotid angiography, echo-flow examination of the carotid system and temporal biopsy were used as reference methods </plain></SENT>
