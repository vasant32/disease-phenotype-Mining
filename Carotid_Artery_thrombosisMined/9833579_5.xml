<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using B-mode ultrasonography, we evaluated the extracranial ICA in 11 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardioembolic ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A homogeneous, elastic, oscillating intraluminal mass echo originating in the extracranial ICA extended distally in 5 (46%) of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The echoes moved quickly and distally during the systolic phase of the cardiac cycle and returned slowly to the original position during the diastolic phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed a postmortem study 24 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in 1 patient with an oscillating intraluminal mass echo that had been demonstrated by duplex ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ICA lumen was obstructed with a fresh string-like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings of oscillating intraluminal mass echo may help establish a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> embolic ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
