<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report describes a series of 12 patients who underwent urgent surgical treatment for primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> between January 1999 and December 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Upon admission, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had severe neurologic deficits contralateral to carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient experienced ongoing changes in the level of consciousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The interval between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and admission was less than 6 hr in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Initial work-up in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients included a brain computed tomographic scan with contrast injection and carotid duplex scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The operative procedure consisted of carotid thomboemdarterectomy after shunt placement with prosthetic patch closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative angiography was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following treatment, we observed deterioration of neurologic status leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in one case; improvement with partial regression of initial neurologic deficit in two cases, including one patient who died from causes unrelated to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e>; and full neurologic recovery in nine cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The delay to revascularization was longer than 6 hr in both patients who died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data support surgical intervention for carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in selected patients without major <z:hpo ids='HP_0004372'>disturbances of consciousness</z:hpo> or hemorrhagic infarction, provided that the delay to revascularization is less than 6 hr </plain></SENT>
