<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One patient had a residual technical stenosis of less than 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight patients died during the one and a half year follow-up from nonstroke-related causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After on an average 14 months flow parameters were evaluated with Color Duplex Sonography to detect recurrent stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One (5.5%) mild asymptomatic recurrent stenosis of less than 50% was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The residual stenosis remained unchanged and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other sites showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> flow patterns </plain></SENT>
