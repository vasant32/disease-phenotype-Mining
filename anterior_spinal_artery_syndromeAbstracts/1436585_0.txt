Carotid-subclavian bypass has been adopted since 1956. The commonest indication is to abolish arterial occlusion or stenosis in patients with subclavian steal syndrome. Ten patients were submitted to carotid-subclavian bypass under regional anaesthesia: block of anterior rami of spinal nerves C3-C4 and block of cervico-brachial plexus by injection into the continuous perineural connective tissue space at the level of C6. The surgical procedure required carotid occlusion and cerebral function monitoring. The advantages of regional anaesthesia are the ability to monitor the patient's cerebral perfusion and function, to detect intraoperative ischaemia and embolisation and minimal interference with the cardiovascular and respiratory function.
