The purpose of this report is to present a rare case of anterior spinal artery syndrome (ASAS) in which there proved to be a combined lesion of paralysis and adhesion. A 26-year-old woman with a history of ASAS complained of difficulty of tracheal decannulation. In 1988, she was intubated and underwent tracheotomy because of respiratory muscle weakness, and she was decannulated in 1990. In 1998, she had cesarean delivery under general anesthesia, and postdelivery dyspnea necessitated tracheotomy again. On her first visit to us, endoscopic examination revealed bilateral vocal fold immobility at the midline without an apparent web. Direct laryngoscopy under general anesthesia revealed a posterior glottic adhesion and scarring, which were treated by excision of the scar and local steroid injection. The left vocal fold gradually regained mobility, permitting decannulation 3 months after treatment. This complicated vocal fold immobility was found to be due to adhesion and partial paralysis combined.
