STUDY DESIGN: Observational analyses of 55 adult patients who underwent elective sequential anterior-posterior thoracolumbosacral surgical corrections for spinal deformities were used to evaluate the efficacy of pulmonary artery catheter monitoring. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that during complex reconstructive surgery for spinal deformities, pulmonary artery catheter monitoring identifies a subset of patients with pulmonary injury and is essential in their management. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Patients who undergo sequential anterior-posterior thoracolumbosacral surgical corrections for spinal deformities experience significant perioperative morbidity. Although the value of pulmonary artery catheter monitoring is controversial, its use in these procedures may help identify potential physiologic complications and improve surgical outcome. METHODS: All patients were monitored with a pulmonary artery catheter during surgery until at least postoperative day 1. Outcome measurements included blood loss, vertebral levels fused, operative time, postoperative respiratory complications, and days in intensive care. RESULTS: Eight (8/55; 14.5%) patients according to pulmonary artery catheter monitoring demonstrated elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and noncardiac pulmonary edema. These patients had longer operative procedures with greater blood loss and had more postoperative respiratory complications. They were treated appropriately in intensive care and discharged without further complications. CONCLUSION: Pulmonary artery catheter monitoring of patients who undergo complex spinal fusion facilitates the identification of patients with pulmonary injury and is essential in the management of these patients in the postoperative period. It may, also, be a marker for embolic injury to the lung.
