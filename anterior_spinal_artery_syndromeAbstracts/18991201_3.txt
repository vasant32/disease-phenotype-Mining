Anterior spinal artery (ASA) infarction is a rare but well-described cause of flaccid paraparesis in adults, presenting with a high thoracic spinothalamic sensory level and preservation of dorsal column function. Careful sensory examination, demonstrating loss of spinothalamic modalities with preservation of dorsal column modalities, supports a clinical diagnosis of ASA infarction. Findings on conventional MRI of the spinal cord are often non-specific, and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is not routinely performed. We describe four children with ASA infarction after minor trauma. DWI was performed in all cases and confirmed the clinical diagnosis.
