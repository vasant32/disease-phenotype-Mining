Aspergillosis of the central nervous system (CNS) is an uncommon infection, mainly occurring in immunocompromised patients. Beside cerebral involvement spinal cord lesions are extremely rare. To our knowledge, aspergillosis initially presenting with acute paraplegia due to mycotic thrombosis of the anterior spinal artery in a formerly healthy patient has, so far, not been reported. Neither a primary focus nor an underlying disease had been detected.
