The authors present the results of microsurgical anterior cervical foraminotomy used in unilateral cervical radiculopathy caused by lateral disc herniation or foraminal stenosis. In 2000 to 2006, anterior cervical foraminotomy was performed at one or two adjacent levels in 44 patients (27 males and 17 females aged 18 to 64 years (mean age 43 years)) with cervical radiculopathy and myelopathy. All the patients underwent pre- and postoperative computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and functional X-ray study. The surgical technique permitted anterior decompression of the affected nerve root from the site of its formation to the vertebral artery, by maintaining the stability and mobility of the involved vertebral segments. The immediate postoperative period was marked by excellent results with regression of radicular syndrome in 84% of the patients and by good results in 16%. A late (6-month-to-6-year) follow-up showed excellent (78%) and good (22%) results without additional surgery. The findings indicate that anterior cervical foraminotomy is an effective technique of nerve root decompression in patients with lateral disc herniation or foraminal stenosis.
