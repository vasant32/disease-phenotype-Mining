As a result of complex studies, out of 275 patients with myocardial infarction, cardiospinal syndromes were distinguished in 68 cases (24,6%). Of these, 14 manifested a syndrome of the anterior spinal artery, 6 a syndrome of the posterior longitudinal arteries. Disturbances of spinal circulation in the system of the radicular spinal arteries were revealed in 48 patients. Clinically, they involved a cardiohumerospinal syndrome (18 patients), cardio-intercostal spinal syndrome (9 patients), and cardio-lumbosacral syndrome (21 patients). Complex therapy of the cardiospinal syndromes (besides myocardial infarction treatment) included parenteral administration of 10% sodium salicylate, solkoseryl, troxevasin, dibazol, galanthamine (in the postinfarction period), proserin, as well as oral administration of antisclerotic, metabolic, nootropic and venotonic drugs. Complete regression of the spinal symptoms was recorded in 35, improvement in 12 patients. In the remaining patients, the recovery was negligible, and such patients were administered repeated courses of treatment.
