Procedures involving anterior surgical decompression and fusion are being performed with increasing frequency for the treatment of a variety of pathological processes of the spine including trauma, deformity, infection, degenerative disease, failed-back syndrome, discogenic pain, metastases, and primary spinal neoplasms. Because these operations involve anatomy that is often unfamiliar to many neurological and orthopedic surgeons, a significant proportion of the associated complications are not related to the actual decompressive or fusion procedure but instead to the actual exposure itself. To understand the nature of these injuries, a detailed anatomical study and dissection was undertaken in six cadaveric specimens. Critical structures at risk in the abdomen and retroperitoneum were identified, and their anatomical relationships were categorized and photographed. These structures included the psoas muscle, kidneys, ureters, diaphragm and crura, esophageal hiatus, thoracic duct, greater splanchnic nerves, phrenic nerves, sympathetic chains, medial arcuate ligament, superior and inferior hypogastric plexus, segmental and radicular vertebral vessels, aorta, vena cava, median sacral artery, common iliac vessels, iliolumbar veins, lumbosacral plexus, and presacral hypogastric plexus. Based on these dissections and an extensive review of the literature, the authors provide a detailed anatomically based discussion of the complications associated with anterior lumbar surgery.
