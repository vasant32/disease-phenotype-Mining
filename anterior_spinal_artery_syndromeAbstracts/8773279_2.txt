We report the MRI findings in two patients with presumed cervical spinal cord infarcts in the anterior spinal artery territory. MRI revealed abnormal signal intensities and/or band-like enhancement in the anterior two-thirds of the cervical spinal cord, corresponding to the vascular territory of the anterior spinal artery. Clinically there was an anterior spinal cord syndrome.
