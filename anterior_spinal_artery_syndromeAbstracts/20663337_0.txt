Summary: We describe a rare case of multiple arteriovenous fistulae of the spinal cord (SCAVF) in the same myelomer in a five-year-old boy. This case report consists of a trifocal SCAVF at the Th12 myelomeric level without communication between the three different fistulae. Two AVF were located posteriorly, bilateraly, in the spinal cord, fed by left and right posterior radiculopial arteries and one anteriorly in the anterior spinal axis. The venous drainage was independent for each lesion. The patient presents associated lesions characterized by cutaneous stain and inferior limb asymmetry. A metameric distribution is the explanation for the multiplicity of these lesions in a syndromic association related to Cobb syndrome. The patient was treated by transarterial embolization using glue with occlusion of the three different fistulae. The patient achieved a good improvement in neurological status.
