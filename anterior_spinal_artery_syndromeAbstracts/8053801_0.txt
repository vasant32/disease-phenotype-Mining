Marfan's syndrome is a hereditary disorder involving a deficit in connective tissue collagen. Physical findings include musculoskeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular abnormalities. A 29-year-old man with a history of Marfan's syndrome was admitted to the hospital with back and chest pain secondary to a dissecting aortic aneurysm. He later underwent surgical aortic bypass graft surgery. Postoperatively, he was paraplegic. Our impression was anterior spinal artery syndrome due to prolonged cross-clamping of the aorta during surgical repair. This paper shows the risk of paralysis resulting from surgical repair of an aortic aneurysm as a poorly documented complication of Marfan's syndrome.
