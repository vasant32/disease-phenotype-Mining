We reported two cases of anterior spinal artery syndrome in childhood evaluated by MRI of the spinal cord. The T2-weighted MRI revealed high signal intensity in the anterior region of spinal cord in both cases. These findings might be related with edema of the ischemic region. Several years later, the regions of the spinal cord showed atrophic changes. The high signal intensity on the T2-weighted MRI was characteristic of the anterior spinal artery syndrome.
