A 58-year-old woman developed slowly progressive hearing loss, anosmia, and unsteady gait. She had neither repeated episode of headache nor a past history of neurosurgical operation or head injury. Neurological examination revealed anosmia, moderate degree of sensorineural hearing loss. She showed loss of caloric response bilaterally. No nystagmus was found. Romberg sign was present. No cerebellar ataxia was noted in the finger-to-nose or the heel-to-knee test. No adiadochokinesis was noted. Deep tendon reflexes were increased in both upper and lower extremities. Sensation was intact. She showed disturbance of the righting reflex in the tilt-table examination. CSF were under normal pressure, xanthochromic with siderophages. CSF total protein and ferritin level were elevated. T2-weighted image (TE4000/TR100) of high field strength magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed marginal hypointensity of the brain stem, the Sylvian fissures, the tips of temporal lobes, anterior cerebellar surfaces and the entire spinal cord. Angiography of the cerebral vessels and spinal arteries failed to identify the source of bleeding. It seemed likely that she had lost bilateral vestibular and auditory functions caused by hemosidelin deposition to her eighth nerves which are often affected by this disorder. Her disturbance of gait and station was apparently similar to cerebellar ataxic gait, however, she did not have limb ataxia. The electronystagmogram revealed marked degree of vestibular dysfunction (VOR) and relative sparing of cerebellar function (OKN). Her disturbance of the righting reflex in the tilt-table examination and the characteristic feature of her Romberg sign with directional preponderance also indicate that the bilateral loss of vestibular functions, i.e., vestibular ataxia caused her dysequilibrium syndrome. It is our impression that vestibular ataxia might precede cerebellar ataxia commonly reported so far.
