A 73 year old man had a pure, acute pseudobulbar syndrome. The pathological study showed only two infarcts of different ages. They involved uncompletely the territories of both anterior cohroidal arteries. On semi-serial sections, both cortico-bulbar tracts were destroyed whereas the cortico-spinal tracts were spared.
