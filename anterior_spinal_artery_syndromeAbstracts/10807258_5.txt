OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Type IVc arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the spinal cord consist of multiple high-flow feeding vessels, and they often present a challenging management situation. Their location is intradural and extramedullary, and they are rare malformations that are difficult to treat owing to the risk of thrombosis of the anterior spinal artery. The authors report a case of Type IVc spinal AVM in a patient with a family history of three siblings with pulmonary AVMs. Spinal AVMs have been reported to be associated with inherited syndromes such as familial cutaneous hemangiomas and Kartagener's syndrome, but an association with pulmonary AVMs has not previously been described. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 27-year-old man presented with sudden onset of occipital headache with cervical radiation while weightlifting. Results of computed tomography of the brain were normal, but lumbar puncture revealed a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient had a 1-year history of a neurogenic bladder and exhibited marked left calf muscle wasting. INTERVENTION: The patient underwent spinal magnetic resonance imaging, which revealed the AVM in the conus region. Selective spinal angiography was performed for diagnostic purposes. A laminectomy was performed, and the vessels feeding the AVM were clipped, as was the fistula. CONCLUSION: The patient remained neurologically stable, and angiography confirmed obliteration of the AVM. This is the first case report of a patient with a spinal AVM who had multiple siblings with pulmonary malformations or AVMs.
