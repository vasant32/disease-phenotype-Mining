A sixty-seven-year-old man suffered from acute anterior spinal artery syndrome at the level of T-10. Transverse myelopathy developed by the eighth day. Computed tomography of the brain on the thirteenth day demonstrated hemorrhagic infarction in the left occipital lobe and fresh ischemic infarction in the right cerebellar hemisphere. Respiratory distress was the cause of death on the fifteenth day. Autopsy study showed severe ischemic necrosis of the spinal cord below T-10, and multiple infarcted lesions in the brain, lung, kidney, and heart. Saddle thromboembolism of the bilateral trunk of the pulmonary artery was the major cause of his death. Deep venous thrombosis in the pelvis was disclosed to be the primary source of multiple paradoxical embolisms through the patent foramen ovale.
