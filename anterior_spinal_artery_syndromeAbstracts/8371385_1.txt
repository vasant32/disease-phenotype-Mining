Lower urinary tract function was studied in 10 patients with the anterior spinal artery syndrome. In the acute stage all patients had complete urinary retention. Cystometry in 3 patients showed detrusor areflexia. At a neurologically stable stage 9 patients could void and 1 had urinary retention during the preceding 7 years. Cystometric bladder capacities at first and maximum desire to void were decreased in 8 patients and normal in 2. Detrusor hyperreflexia was noted in 8 patients, a normal bladder in 1 and detrusor areflexia in 1. External urethral sphincter electromyography revealed detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia in 4 patients and normal findings in 6. We conclude that the vesicomotor dysfunction in this syndrome is similar to that of traumatic spinal cord injury except that bladder sensation is preserved. The latter finding indicates that at least some of the bladder sensation travels via the posterior columns of the spinal cord.
