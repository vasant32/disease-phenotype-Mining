 BACKGROUND: Spinal cord infarction from anterior spinal cord syndrome (ASAS) in children is a rare pathology and comprises the following clinical symptoms: sudden onset of pain and flaccid para- or tetraparesis, bladder dysfunction, and dissociated sensory loss with impairment of pain and temperature perception. Deep sensibility is not affected. PATIENT: A 13-year-old male patient presented to our emergency department with a bilateral leg weakness. 1 week before, he had suffered a leg strain in a Taekwondo-fight from which he recovered completely. On physical examination our patient's legs were in flaccid paralysis, tone was decreased and he had dissociated sensory loss and acute retention of urine. Blood count, ESR, electrolytes, serologic tests for various pathogens and CSF examination all were normal. However, tests for values of an acute endothelial lesion were increased and he was a homozygous carrier of MTHFR-polymorphism. MRI performed on the day of admission was normal but showed dramatic changes 2 days later with increased signal intensity in the ventral aspect of the spinal cord, characteristic for an ASAS. Treatment included highdose methylprednisolone, a suprapubic bladder catheter, sufficient anticoagulation and a rapid transfer to a rehabilitation centre. DISCUSSION: We assume that a combination of the patient's prothrombotic risk factor (MTHFR-polymorphism with elevated homocysteine levels) and his trauma in the taekwondo-fight with consecutive vessel injury caused an occlusion of the artery by late emboli or a growing thrombus.
