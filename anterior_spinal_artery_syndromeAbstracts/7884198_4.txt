Subsequent to cardiac arrest, a 58-year-old man with intractable dysrhythmia and severe arteriosclerosis developed flaccid paraplegia, depressed deep tendon reflexes, and showed no pain or temperature sensation caudal to Th-7 in spite of completely intact proprioception and vibration sensation. An echocardiogram showed no clots or vegetation on the prosthetic valve and no thrombus in the left atrium or left ventricle. The patient's paraplegia was permanent, at least through a follow-up period of 2 years. These findings suggest that the etiology was spinal cord ischemia due to blood supply in the area of the anterior spinal artery (ASA); however, magnetic resonance T2-weighted imaging demonstrated signal abnormalities throughout the gray matter and in the adjacent center white matter. Somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEP) measure neural transmission in the afferent spinal cord pathway, which is located in the lateral and posterior columns of the white matter; these showed a delay in latency between Th-6 and Th-7. The spinal cord is as vulnerable to transient ischemia as the brain. Spinal cord ischemia after cardiac arrest results from principal damage in the anterior horn of the gray matter, the so-called ASA syndrome; however, the pathways of SEP and pathogenesis of the spinal cord ischemia need further investigation.
