A 23 year old female presented to Townsville General Hospital seven months after a positive urine test for Schistosomiasis with conus modularize signs. MRI confirmed a conus medullaris enhancing lesion. Serology was positive for Schistosoma IgG : IgM, 3.4 : 1.8. Urine screening for ova, stool sample, rectal biopsy and diagnostic investigations were negative. She was treated empirically for Schistosoma without biopsy with marked resolution of her symptoms and signs. She remains neurologically well one year after presentation. Serological identification from the Centre of Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta Georgia by western blot has shown positive IgG for Schistosoma haematobium and mansoni. Schistosoma myelopathy is a rare cause of transverse myelitis, conus medullaris syndrome, anterior spinal artery occlusion and radiculopathy in Australia. It should however be included in the differential diagnosis in a patient who has been in or presenting from an endemic area.
