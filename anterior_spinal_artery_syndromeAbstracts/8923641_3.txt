STUDY DESIGN: Case reports. OBJECTIVES: Description of neurologic and vascular complications of scoliosis surgery to children and adolescents with ehlers-danios syndrome. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There have been no previous reports of neurologic and vascular complications of scoliosis surgery in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Scoliosis and vascular fragility are characteristics of certain types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. METHODS:Case reports and literature review. RESULTS: Subsequent to scoliosis surgery, three patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome developed neurologic complications: two developed paraplegia, and one developed unilateral foot and ankle weakness with transient neurogenic bladder. Another patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome experienced avulsion of segmental arteries during anterior spinal surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome may be at high risk for neurologic and vascular complications consequent to scoliosis surgery, necessitating careful perioperative evaluation and management.
