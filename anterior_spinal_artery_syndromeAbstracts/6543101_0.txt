Complications in connection with operations also lead to the question of possible relations to the type of anaesthesia and their avoidability. The subject is treated demonstrating two cases of intracerebral haemorrhage and anterior spinal artery syndrome during and following catheter-epidural anaesthesia or spinal anaesthesia, respectively. No definite causal connection was established, even if the emergencies presumably would not have occurred without operation and anaesthesia. Complications are not completely avoidable, even if operation and anaesthesia as regards indication, execution and monitoring, are carried out correctly.
