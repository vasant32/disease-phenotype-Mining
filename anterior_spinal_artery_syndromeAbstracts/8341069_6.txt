We report our experience with 27 (22 male and 5 female) patients who were from 16 to 82 years of age (median 29 years) who underwent surgical repair for traumatic pseudoaneurysm of the thoracic aorta. The cause of injury in all cases was blunt trauma. Repair was accomplished with partial bypass by means of a roller pump with systemic heparinization in 6 (23%), Gott shunt in 7 (27%), clamp-and-sew technique in 6 (23%), and centrifugal pump without systemic heparinization in 8 (30%). Significant postoperative complications occurred in 12 patients. Paraplegia occurred in 1 patient (clamp and sew), anterior spinal cord syndrome in 1 (clamp and sew), renal failure in 1 (Gott shunt), temporary vocal cord paralysis in 2 (Gott shunt, centrifugal pump), permanent vocal cord paralysis in 1 (roller pump), and coagulopathy in 2 (centrifugal pump, Gott shunt). Hospital mortality occurred in 5 of 27 (19%), (1 clamp and sew, 1 Gott shunt, 1 centrifugal pump, 2 roller pump). Follow-up of survivors (1 week to 20 years, median 2.1 years) revealed no further problems from either aortic graft or primary repair. Although patient numbers are small, evaluation of each of the four surgical techniques leads us to favor repair with shunting with a centrifugal pump without heparin. The potential advantage of left atrial-left femoral artery shunt with centrifugal pump support was evident in operative field exposure, afterload reduction, avoidance of clamp injury, and maintenance of stable distal aortic perfusion without heparin.
