INTRODUCTION: Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy can lead to different clinical presentations, such as bilateral cortical borderzone infarctions due to cerebral hypoperfusion (especially after cardiopulmonary arrest), which would cause a "man-in-the-barrel" syndrome if the anterior circulation is affected. This syndrome has multiple etiologies, both central (bilateral frontal and/or pyramidal decussation lesions and cervical spinal cord lesions) as well as peripheral ones such as multifocal motor neuropathy. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 19-year-old man who developed a "man-in-the-barrel" syndrome with bilateral and proximal upper limb brachial diplegia after bilateral watershed infarctions involving distal fields of the middle and the anterior cerebral artery due to cerebral hypoperfusion in a comatose patient without internal carotid obstruction. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of death in this syndrome is higher than 90% and it predicts a worse outcome in comatose patients. Nevertheless, our patient has had complete clinical improvement.
