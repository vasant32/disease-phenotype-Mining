The authors present a case of anterior spinal artery stroke demonstrated by diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) using single-shot echo-planar imaging. DWI clearly demonstrated hyperintensity with a decreased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) at 26 hours after onset. At 28 days, there was persistent hyperintensity with an increased ADC, corresponding to T2-weighted hyperintensity in the whole spinal gray matter at the C2-C7 vertebral level. DWI provided satisfactory images and was helpful for diagnosing and evaluating anterior spinal artery stroke.
