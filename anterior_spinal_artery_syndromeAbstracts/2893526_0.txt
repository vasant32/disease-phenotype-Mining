A 43-year-old woman with anterior spinal artery syndrome was admitted with complaints of tetraplegia and urinary retention. Her bladder had capacity of more than 500 ml and was inactive, with low voltage of external urethral sphincter. She was treated with distigmine bromide and intermittent catheterization. 50 days later, urodynamic study showed normal bladder and incomplete coordination of external sphincter. A 78-year-old man had chief complaints of urinary retention and paraplegia. A catheter was left indwell for 6 months. Then he was treated with intermittent catheterization, but urgency incontinence was still observed. We discussed the therapy of neurogenic bladder due to the anterior spinal artery syndrome.
