A 35-year-old male presented with trigeminal neuralgia associated with venous angioma at the root entry zone. Magnetic resonance imaging and angiography demonstrated a venous angioma with a dilated petrosal draining vein, and displacement of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA). The AICA and dilated petrosal vein were both decompressed, resulting in complete relief from symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia for 30 months. Microvascular decompression rather than resection of venous angioma is recommended for treatment of such cases. The possibility of a venous anomaly should be considered in younger patients with trigeminal neuralgia.
