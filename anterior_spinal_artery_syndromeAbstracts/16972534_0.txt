Spinal cord infarction is a relatively uncommon condition in young children and adolescents, however, it should be included in the differential diagnosis of acute cord compression. Depending on the vessel involved, the clinical presentation may differ. The degree of recovery in spinal cord infarcts varies from one individual to another. Recovery of motor function is progressive in most of the patients, with the deficit being maximal at the onset.
