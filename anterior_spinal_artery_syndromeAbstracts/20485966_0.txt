 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Developments in anesthesiology have improved safety indices. Several techniques and agents are used to control the hemodynamic response and minimize adverse effects triggered by surgical stimuli in patients undergoing cardiac procedures. CASE REPORT: This is a 70 years old male patient, 1.74 m, 75 kg, ASA III, and NYHA II. The patient had controlled dyslipedemia, type II diabetes mellitus, and hypertension; history of smoking, peripheral vascular disease, and myocardial infarction 20 years ago. The patient underwent revascularization with the left internal mammary artery and saphenous grafts with extracorporeal circulation with intermittent clamping of the aorta. During the first 24 hours in the ICU, the patient developed hemodynamic instability, sudden hypotension, and atrial fibrillation. Twenty-six hours after the end of the surgery, the patient was awake, hemodynamically stable, and with good respiratory dynamics, being extubated. The patient was talkative and oriented, but immobile and negative reflexes in the lower limbs. Neurological evaluation showed: cranial nerves without changes, no complaints of pain below the hips, preserved superficial and deep sensitivity, adequate distal perfusion without edema, and flaccid paraplegia below T8. The echocardiogram did not show any changes. CT scan of the lumbosacral spine was negative for compressive mass in the epidural space or adjacent to it. CONCLUSION: Anterior spinal artery syndrome should be considered in procedures with manipulation of the aorta. Prevention, especially in patients at risk, is necessary. Computed tomography, for the differential diagnosis, and MRI, to localize the lesion, are important.
