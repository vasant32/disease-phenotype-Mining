A baby with acute fetal distress and severe heart malformation presented with persisting hypotonia and muscle weakness. Clinical, electromyography, and muscle biopsy findings were compatible with anterior horn cell disease. Postmortem study showed widespread ischemic necrosis in the anterior gray matter of the spinal cord. This is the first report of anterior spinal artery syndrome in a neonate.
