We studied 9 patients with clinical evidence of spinal cord ischemia or infarction who had altered vesicourethral function. Of the patients 6 had some preservation of bladder and lower extremity sensation, a clinical pattern consistent with the anterior spinal artery syndrome. A total of 3 patients had a clinical picture more consistent with complete transverse myelopathy, since they had no preservation of bladder or lower extremity sensation. Despite sensory levels well above the sacral spinal cord segments, 6 patients had detrusor areflexia (4 with bethanechol supersensitivity and 4 with neuropathic changes in the perineal electromyograph) indicating longitudinal spinal cord involvement. Three patients had detrusor hyperreflexia with vesicosphincter dyssynergia, indicating some preservation of the sacral spinal cord. In 6 patients appreciation of pinprick in the lower extremities was absent or decreased but light touch or position sense was preserved. Bladder sensation was dissociated in 4 of these 6 patients, since they had perception of bladder distention but loss of urge to void. These findings indicate that bladder distention is a sensory modality probably mediated via the posterior spinal cord, while the sense of urgency is probably conveyed by the anterior spinal cord.
