Anterior spinal cord syndrome is a rare condition with a variety of precipitating factors. Patients typically complain of weakness or paralysis of the extremities, often accompanied by pain, but frequently without a history of trauma. A 48-year-old man presented to the emergency department complaining of neck pain and inability to move his legs in the absence of trauma. Several hours prior he had seen his private physician and was given a dose of atenolol for elevated blood pressure. He had not previously been on medications for hypertension. His neurological examination revealed bilateral paralysis of the lower extremities. In the upper extremities he had weakness and sensory loss at the level of C6. Rectal tone was decreased and without sensation. Cervical and thoracic spine magnetic resonance imaging showed spondylotic disc disease, with disc herniation at C6-7 causing severe spinal canal stenosis. Despite i.v. methylprednisolone, pressors, and a prolonged intensive care unit course, the patient was discharged 5 weeks later with continued neurological deficits. Anterior spinal cord syndrome results from compression of the anterior spinal artery and often occurs in the absence of traumatic injury. The recognition, management, and prognosis of this condition are discussed.
