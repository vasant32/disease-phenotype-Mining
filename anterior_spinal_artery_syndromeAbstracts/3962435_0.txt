The important anatomical structures and the topographic relationships of lumbar disc surgery are described. Recent examinations about the epidural venous plexuses, the vascular supply of the spinal cord and nerve roots in the spinal canal enlarged our knowledge. Anterior and posterior spinal nerve roots differ in reaction to horizontally directed pull. The prevertebral anatomical structures which can be damaged by iatrogenic ventral perforation of the lumbar disc are demonstrated and their clinical importance is discussed.
