A case of a large extramedullary arteriovenous fistula in a young man, which was deemed inoperable, is described. The fistula was mainly supplied by the anterior spinal artery and was responsible for a progressive myeloradicular syndrome. Successful treatment with detachable balloons was carried out. Along with this case report, a review is made of the different types of extramedullary arteriovenous fistulas and their treatment based upon 11 cases seen at Lariboisi√®re Hospital: type 1 is a plain small fistula where embolization is contraindicated; type 2 shows an enlarged anterior spinal artery with dysplastic vein and may be embolized with solid particles; type 3 is a very large multipediculated fistula where the best treatment seems to be detachable balloons. The indications for using detachable balloons for temporary occlusion and for definitive treatment are reviewed. Special emphasis is placed on the possibility of detaching balloons without the need for a coaxial catheter.
