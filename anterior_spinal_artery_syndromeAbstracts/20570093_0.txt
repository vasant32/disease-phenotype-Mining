The artery of Adamkiewicz is the most significant tributary of the anterior spinal artery in the midthoracic region; the occlusion of this artery results in a well-described phenomenon consisting of paraplegia with loss of the sensation of pain, temperature, and touch as well as loss of sphincter control. Proprioception and vibration sense are typically preserved. Although this phenomenon has been associated with several surgeries as well as preexisting aortic abnormalities, the literature thus far has not reported this as a complication of hip or knee arthroplasty. Two case histories are presented.
