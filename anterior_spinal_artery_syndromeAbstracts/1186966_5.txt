Under usual technical conditions, it is possible, in a great percentage of cases, to visualize angiographically the afferent radiculospinal artery feeding the anterior cervical spinal axis, coming from the vertebral arteries. The level of its emergence is varied, predominating at C5--C6. This radiculospinal artery can be directly affected by a spondylotic lesion at the foraminal level and is one of the causes of the ischemic syndrome observed in the cerival myelopathies resulting from this process.
