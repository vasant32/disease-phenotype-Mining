A 65-year-old patient with ischemic heart disease and severe diabetes mellitus underwent minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass grafting under general combined with epidural anesthesia. Paraplegia developed after surgery and the diagnosis of anterior spinal artery syndrome was made based on the patient's neurological condition and magnetic resonance imaging findings. Paraplegia following epidural anesthesia is a rare but recognized complication and this complication should be taken into account, especially in patients at risk, when considering epidural analgesia techniques in the minimally invasive cardiac surgery.
