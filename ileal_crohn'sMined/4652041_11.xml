<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment was either by ileo-transverse side-to-side bypass (21 patients) or primary excision and end-to-end ileo-colic anastomosis (89 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a long follow up (mean 13.8 years) the date and indications for the second major operative intervention are recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cumulative risk of recurrence recorded each year after the primary operation shows that after bypass compared with excision there is approximately twice the risk of requiring a further major operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After bypass the indication for the second operation is usually a local complication of the still active disease and after excision it is usually a juxta-anastomotic recurrence with stenosis </plain></SENT>
