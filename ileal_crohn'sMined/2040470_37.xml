<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have reviewed the outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing their first intestinal resection for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> at this hospital between 1970 and 1987 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recurrence rates, defined by recurrent intestinal symptoms and radiological confirmation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mucosal disease</z:e>, were calculated using survival analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Age, sex, anatomical location of disease, indication for surgery, preoperative duration of symptomatic disease, use of preoperative bowel rest, and pathological features of the resected bowel were analysed individually and jointly as potential risk factors influencing postoperative recurrence of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighty two patients (age, mean (SD) 14.8 (2.5) years) underwent intestinal resection and were followed postoperatively for a minimum of one year (mean 5.3 (3.3) years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anatomical location of disease, indication for surgery, and preoperative duration of symptomatic disease were the only factors that significantly influenced the duration of the recurrence free interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with diffuse ileocolonic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> experienced earlier recurrence (50% at one year) than children with predominantly small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel disease</z:e> (50% recurrence at five years, p less than 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Failure of medical therapy independent of disease location as the sole indication for surgery was associated with an earlier relapse than when surgery was performed for a specific intestinal complication such as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> or obstruction (p less than 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing resection within one year of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms experienced delayed recrudescence of active disease (30% recurrence by eight years) compared with patients whose preoperative duration of symptomatic disease was longer (50% recurrence by four years when preoperative duration of disease was one to four years and 50% by three years when disease had been present greater than four years preoperatively, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean height velocity of patients with growth potential increased from 2.4 (2.3) cm per year preoperatively to 8.1 (3.4) cm per year in the first postoperative year (p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results support an early approach to surgery in the management of ileal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> with or without caecal or right colonic involvement, especially when complicated by persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The higher recurrence rates in more diffuse ileocolonic disease emphasise the need for alternative treatment strategies in these children </plain></SENT>
