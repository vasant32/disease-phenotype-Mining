<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Faecal calprotectin (FC) is closely correlated with colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, but is thought to be of less utility in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ileal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interpretation of existing data linking FC with SBMRI findings have been confounded by the presence of colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore aimed to ascertain how FC best reflects MRI findings exclusively in the small bowel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 150 SBMRI studies with matched FC results (±30 days) were identified from the Edinburgh FC Register (2008-12; n = 18,138) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Scans were entered into an anonymous 'teaching' list on PACS and each re-read independently by 2 expert GI radiologists blind to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinical and lab data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Technical, quality and disease parameters were recorded onto standard proformas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Scans rated by one or other radiologist as being of poor quality were excluded (n = 31/150) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>7/13 disease parameters were excluded due to poor interobserver variability (Cohen's kappa &lt;0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A 6 item simple MRI score (range 0-10) was derived from assessment of the worst segment (bowel wall thickness, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, and relative enhancement, mesenteric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> and pre-stenotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>) plus total disease extent (overall kappa = 0.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For comparisons with FC, studies where the radiologists reported upper GI or colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> were excluded (27/119) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 150 SBMRI scans were re-evaluated from 123 patients with purely ileal Crohn's (Montreal L1, n = 109; L3 + previous panproctocolectomy, n = 14; 65% female; median age at MRI 45 years (IQR 32-56); median follow-up 34 months (IQR 25-44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median (IQR) FC was 80 μg/g (20-142) where SBMRI demonstrated no active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ileal disease</z:e> (simple MRI score = 0, n = 38), 198 μg/g (120-444) for mild to moderate (1-6, n = 30) and 398 μ/g (168-771) for severe disease (&gt;6, n = 24) (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>ROC analysis showed an AUC of 0.81 (0.72-0.90) for FC which was significantly higher than for CRP (0.65 [0.53-0.77], p = 0.020) (Figure 1). gutjnl;63/Suppl_1/A74-b/F1F1F1 Abstract PTU-081 Figure 1 CONCLUSION: FC correlates closely with SBMRI findings in ileal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and outperforms other laboratory tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In future, following validation, we will derive clinical useful MRI and FC cut-offs that predicate on important patient outcomes </plain></SENT>
