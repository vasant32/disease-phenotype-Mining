<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty of 44 parous women with distal ileal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and 28 of 44 with colonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> had achieved their first pregnancy on average 8 years and 6.2 years respectively before the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Resections for each patient were negatively correlated with parity in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(Distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ileal disease</z:e> (p = 0.034, rs = 0.3207), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">colonic disease</z:e> (p = 0.051, rs = -0.2960)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with distal ileal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and a history of pregnancy at diagnosis (n = 30, mean follow up = 15 years) had fewer resections/patient when compared with the published resection group: mean (SD); 1.17 (0.65) v 1.57 (1.05), p = 0.006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with colonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and a history of pregnancy at diagnosis (n = 28, mean follow up = 16.5 years) had fewer resections/patient when compared with the published resection group: mean (SD); 0.68 (0.77) v 1.05 (0.77), p = 0.019 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In summary, patients with distal ileal and colonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, who had been pregnant in the past subsequently need fewer surgical resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pregnancy could influence the natural history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> either by decreasing immune responsiveness or by retarding fibrous stricture formation, which is the commonest indication for surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
