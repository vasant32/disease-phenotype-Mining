<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Reduced ileal Paneth cell alpha-defensin expression has been reported to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, especially in patients carrying NOD2 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to independently assess whether NOD2, alpha-defensins and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> are linked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we measured the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels of key Paneth cell antimicrobial <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (DEFA5, DEFA6, LYZ, PLA2G2A), inflammatory cytokines [interkelukin 6 (IL6) and IL8], and a marker of epithelial cell content, villin (VIL1) in 106 samples from both affected ileum (inflamed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> cases, n = 44) and unaffected ileum (non-inflamed; <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> cases, n = 51 and controls, n = 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-human defensin 5 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-5) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi>/eosin immunohistochemical staining was performed on parallel sections from NOD2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and NOD2 mutant ileal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients, DEFA5 and DEFA6 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels were 1.9- and 2.2-fold lower, respectively, in histologically confirmed inflamed ileal mucosa after adjustment for confounders (DEFA5, p&lt;0.001; DEFA6, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to previous studies, we found no significant association between alpha-defensin expression and NOD2 genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-5 protein data supports these <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-5 protein expression appears due to surface epithelial cell loss and reduced Paneth cell numbers as a consequence of tissue damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reduction in alpha-defensin expression is independent of NOD2 status and is due to loss of surface epithelium as a consequence of inflammatory changes rather than being the inciting event prior to <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in ileal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
