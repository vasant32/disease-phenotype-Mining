<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with ileal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) a decrease of Paneth cell α-defensins has been observed which is partially caused by impaired TCF-4 and LRP6 function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show reduced expression of the Wnt signaling effector TCF-1 (also known as TCF7) in patients with ileal CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reporter gene assays and in vitro promoter binding analysis revealed that TCF-1 activates α-defensin <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-5 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-6 transcription in cooperation with β-catenin and that activation is mediated by three distinct TCF binding sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EMSA analysis showed binding of TCF-1 to the respective motifs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In ileal CD patients, TCF-1 mRNA expression levels were significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover we found specifically reduced expression of active TCF-1 mRNA isoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tcf-1 knockout mice exhibited reduced cryptdin expression in the jejunum, which was not constistently seen at other small intestinal locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data provide evidence that TCF-1 mediated Wnt signaling is disturbed in small intestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> which might contribute to the observed barrier dysfunction in the disease </plain></SENT>
