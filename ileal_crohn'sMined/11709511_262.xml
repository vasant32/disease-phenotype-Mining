<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disorder with both a genetic and environmental aetiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical classifications of the disease, such as the newly proposed Vienna classification, may help to define subgroups of patients suitable for studying the influence of specific genetic or environmental factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the stability over the course of the disease of its location and behaviour, as determined according to the Vienna classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The notes of 297 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients regularly followed up at our institution were carefully reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The behaviour and location of the disease according to the Vienna classification were determined at diagnosis and after 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 years of follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportions of the different behaviours and locations of the disease were calculated at these time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A statistical analysis of the evolution of these characteristics over 10 years was performed on a subgroup of 125 patients with at least 10 years of follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The influence of age at diagnosis on location and behaviour of the disease was assessed as well as the influence of location on the behaviour of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The location of the disease remained relatively stable over the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the proportion of patients who had a change in disease location became statistically significant after five years (p=0.01), over 10 years only 15.9% of patients had a change in location (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We observed a more rapid and prominent change in disease behaviour, which was already statistically significant after one year (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Over 10 years, 45.9% of patients had a change in disease behaviour (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The most prominent change was from non-stricturing non-penetrating disease to either stricturing (27.1%; p&lt;0.0001) or penetrating (29.4%; p&lt;0.0001) disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Age at diagnosis had no influence on either location or behaviour of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Ileal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> was more often stricturing, and colonic or ileocolonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> was more often penetrating: this was already the case at diagnosis and became more prominent after 10 years (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Location of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, as defined by the Vienna classification, is a relatively stable phenotype which seems suitable for phenotype-genotype analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Behaviour of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> according to the Vienna classification varies dramatically over the course of the disease and cannot be used in phenotype-genotype analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The potential influence of genes on the behaviour of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> should be studied in subgroups of patients defined by their disease behaviour after a fixed duration of disease </plain></SENT>
