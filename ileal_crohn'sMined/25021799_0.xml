<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Several studies have suggested that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> diarrhoea (BAD) can present with symptoms that are compatible with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262211" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>-D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, uncertainty exists as these have often been retrospective, have not defined <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>-D according to accepted diagnostic criteria, or have included patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diarrhoea in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have examined this issue in a well-characterised cohort of patients with rigorously defined <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>-D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a prospective cross-sectional survey conducted among consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>-D attending Gastroenterology clinics in two hospitals in Sheffield and Leeds, UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent 23-seleno-25-homo-tauro-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16359">cholic acid</z:chebi> (SeHCAT) scanning according to local protocol, with a retention of &lt;15% at day 7 used to confirm BAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of BAD was classed as severe if retention &lt; 5%, moderate if 5.0 &gt;9.9%, and mild if 10.0 &gt;14.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>-D was defined according to the Rome III criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with other known risk factors for BAD, including previous cholecystectomy, terminal ileal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, terminal ileal resection, pelvic or abdominal radiotherapy, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coeliac disease</z:e>, or microscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Participants completed the patient health questionnaire-15, a validated somatisation score, and the hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Demographic data, including age, gender, lifestyle, and body mass index (BMI) were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these factors on presence or absence of BAD was examined by multivariate logistic regression analysis, with results expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with 99% confidence intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This is an interim analysis of an ongoing study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In total, 51 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>-D according to the Rome III criteria have been recruited to date (37 (72.5%) female, mean age 47.0 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In total, 14 (27.5%) were found to have BAD following SeHCAT scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Of these, nine (17.6%) had severe BAD, four moderate, and one mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Mean age, BMI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and somatisation scores were not significantly different among those with, compared with those without, BAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>No predictors of presence of BAD were identified following multivariate logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that more than one-in-four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>-D patients, if investigated, have definite evidence of BAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In the majority, this is severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Failure to investigate patients to exclude BAD as an underlying cause of symptoms compatible with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>-D results in misdiagnosis and a failure to institute effective therapy, in the form of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> sequestrants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>This suggests that future <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> management guidelines should advocate diagnostic testing to exclude BAD before a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>-D is made </plain></SENT>
