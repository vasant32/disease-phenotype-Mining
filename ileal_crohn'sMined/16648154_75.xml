<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Few studies have correlated computed tomography (CT) enterography findings with endoscopic severity and C reactive protein (CRP) concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To examine whether small bowel <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> at CT enterography correlates with endoscopic severity and CRP in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CT enterography datasets from 143 CD patients undergoing ileoscopy were examined for three different CT parameters: CT bowel enhancement, as defined by the ratio of terminal ileal versus control ileal loop attenuation; vascular enlargement of the vasa recta ("the comb sign"); and mesenteric fat density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlations between CT scan parameters, endoscopy, and histology severity scores, and CRP were assessed using Spearman's rank correlation and logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endoscopic score was significantly correlated with CT bowel enhancement, comb sign, and fat density (Spearman correlation coefficients 0.33-0.39; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlations with histological <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> were strongest for bowel enhancement (r = 0.34-0.38; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CRP was elevated in patients with increased fat density versus those with increased bowel enhancement only (median 0.96 v 0.23, p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CRP did not differ significantly between patients without evidence of active Crohn's and those with bowel enhancement and endoscopic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> not involving the perienteric tissues by CT (median 0.24 v 0.36; p = 0.38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Quantitative measures of bowel enhancement at CT enterography correlate with endoscopic and histological severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CRP correlates with radiological findings of perienteric <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (increased fat density), but not of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> limited to the small bowel wall, underscoring the potential role of perienteric <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in CRP response in CD </plain></SENT>
