<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of factors predictive of BAD could help improve detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates factors predictive of BAD (7 day SeHCAT retention &lt;10%) and determines long treatment outcomes in those instigated on medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 515 patients underwent a SeHCAT test in a University hospital (2001-2012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these 41% (210/515) had evidence of BAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Demographic data, clinical and biochemical indices were collected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Binary logistic regression was then used to determine factors predictive of BAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>107 of the 210 (51%) patients with BAD were diagnosed between 2001-2009 and commenced on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> sequestrants.(1) In March 2013, these patients (n = 107) were re-contacted and reassessed either in a gastroenterology clinic or via telephone consultation, determining their bowel frequency, current symptoms, response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> sequestrants and whether on continuing treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were made in pre and post treatment variables using a paired sample t-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Binary Logistic regression identified only terminal ileal Crohn's, terminal ileal resection, previous small bowel surgery and cholecystectomy as predictors of BAD (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With regards to follow up, 54% (58/107) of patients (median age 57 years, range 29-74 years, 42 females) were contactable and agreeable to follow up assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean time since diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28435">BAM</z:chebi> was 7.1 years, with a mean result of 3.6% at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>38% (22/58) of patients were still on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> sequestrants at follow up, with 28% using alternative anti-diarrhoeal agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In those who were on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> sequestrant therapy, mean stool frequency decreased from 7.3 stools per day to 3.9 (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The 34% (20/58) of patients not receiving medical therapy had no change in their daily bowel frequency (7.0 vs 5.35, p = 0.40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The main reason for discontinuing medical therapy in this group was poor tolerability of the prescribed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> sequestrant (Colestyramine/ Colestipol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> was the only alternative diagnosis established in 10% (2/20), accounting for potential persisting symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first longitudinal study to assess patients with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28435">BAM</z:chebi> and identifies factors predictive of this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28435">BAM</z:chebi> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> condition, which best improves with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> sequestrants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Given the problems with tolerability of older <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> sequestrants, consideration should be given to Colsevalam, which may have a better tolerability profile </plain></SENT>
