<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Diffuse jejunoileitis is an uncommon, but important manifestation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> because of the associated high morbidity and challenges in medical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite this there have been no studies of prognosis or management of diffuse jejunoileitis for nearly 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study analysed the outcome among 34 patients (20 women and 14 men) with diffuse jejunoileitis diagnosed between 1960 and 1991 including clinical features, medical and surgical management, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates, current status, and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffuse jejunoileitis presents in younger patients (mean age at diagnosis 26.4 years) than those with distal ileal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (mean age at diagnosis 33.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> presented with clear cut <z:hpo ids='HP_0011458'>abdominal symptoms</z:hpo> including a combination of colicky <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> (91%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (62%), and diarrhoea (53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most patients had severe symptoms reflected by the fact that 77% had been treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> for periods of more than six months at some stage during their follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean follow up from diagnosis was 16 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty eight patients (82%) had at least one operation for diffuse jejunoileitis and two thirds of the patients (n = 21) required two or more operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of surgical intervention was particularly high in the younger patients (r = 0.71, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients requiring surgery was highest in the first year after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The annual operative rate was 15% for the first 10 years and then it fell to 5.2% in years 11-15, and 2.6% in years 16-20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that the disease does burn itself out over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The increasing use of strictureplasty for short strictures and the minimal use of resection has eliminated problems associated with the short small bowel syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The longterm prognosis of this patients is good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Only two patients died (one of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> of the jejunum and another of an unrelated bronchogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>After a mean interval from diagnosis of 16 year, 24 of 32 living patients are well and symptom free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Only eight have <z:hpo ids='HP_0011458'>abdominal symptoms</z:hpo> of whom three are receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> treatment and one <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The combination of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> with the relief of recurrent obstructive symptoms by strictureplasty can together produce a good longterm prognosis in most patients with diffuse jejunoileitis </plain></SENT>
