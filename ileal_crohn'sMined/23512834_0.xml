<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although polymorphisms of the NOD2 gene predispose to the development of ileal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, the precise mechanisms of this increased susceptibility remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous work has shown that transcript expression of the Paneth cell (PC) antimicrobial <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMPs</z:chebi>) α-defensin 4 and α-defensin-related sequence 10 are selectively decreased in Nod2(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the specific mouse background used in this previous study is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In light of recent evidence suggesting that mouse strain strongly influences PC antimicrobial activity, we sought to characterise PC <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> function in commercially available Nod2(-/-) mice on a C57BL/6 (B6) background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specifically, we hypothesised that Nod2(-/-) B6 mice would display reduced <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> expression and activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> (WT) and Nod2(-/-) B6 ileal <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> expression was assessed via real-time PCR, acid <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PCs were enumerated using flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Functionally, α-defensin bactericidal activity was evaluated using a gel-overlay antimicrobial assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Faecal microbial composition was determined using 454-sequencing of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26833">16S</z:chebi> gene in cohoused WT and Nod2(-/-) littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: WT and Nod2(-/-) B6 mice displayed similar PC <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> expression patterns, equivalent α-defensin profiles, and identical antimicrobial activity against commensal and pathogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, minimal differences in gut microbial composition were detected between the two cohoused, littermate mouse groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal that Nod2 does not directly regulate PC antimicrobial activity in B6 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we demonstrate that previously reported Nod2-dependent influences on gut microbial composition may be overcome by environmental factors, such as cohousing with WT littermates </plain></SENT>
