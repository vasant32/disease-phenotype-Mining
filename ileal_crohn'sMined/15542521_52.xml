<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The exact nature of the epithelial barrier defect in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously we showed increased permeability to proteins in ileal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aims were to study if this barrier defect (a) involves endocytotic uptake of antigens and (b) is related to low grade <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> not detectable by histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Macroscopically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> segments of distal ileum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients (n = 10) were subgrouped into non-inflamed (histologically unaffected) and slightly inflamed tissues and studied in Ussing chambers, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ileal specimens from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients (n = 9) as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endocytotic uptake into enterocytes of the protein antigen horseradish peroxidase was assessed by measuring the area of horseradish peroxidase containing endosomes in electron photomicrographs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNF-alpha) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was quantified using real time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For comparison, the effects of low doses of TNF-alpha on endosomal uptake of horseradish peroxidase were studied in cultured T84 cells grown on filter supports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The area of horseradish peroxidase containing endosomes was increased (p&lt;0.001) in enterocytes of non-inflamed ileum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (2.8 (0.7) mum(2)/300 mum(2)) compared with control ileum (0.6 (0.06)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In non-inflamed mucosa, a significant association between endosomal uptake and mucosal expression of TNF-alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (p = 0.03) was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Low concentrations of TNF-alpha (0.25-1.0 ng/ml) enhanced the endosomal uptake of horseradish peroxidase in polarised T84 cells, without affecting transepithelial electrical resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest increased endosomal uptake of antigens in ileal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> that may be mediated by TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data highlight the transcellular route of antigen uptake in barrier dysfunction and implicate the interaction between epithelial cells and the innate immune system in the development of mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
