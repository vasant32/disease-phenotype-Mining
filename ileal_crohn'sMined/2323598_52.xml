<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Harvey-Bradshaw <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> activity index improved significantly, mainly because of reduced frequency of loose stools and diminution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy revealed no corresponding decrease in ileal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, which in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases persisted after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The phospholipase A2 activity in the ileal mucosa was not altered by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study confirmed earlier reports of good symptomatic relief from <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> of the small bowel, but endoscopy suggests that this improvement was not the result of resolution of small intestinal mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
