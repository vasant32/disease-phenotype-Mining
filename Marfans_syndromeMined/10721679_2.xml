<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1; MIM no. 134797) on chromosome 15 was revealed to be the cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date over 137 types of FBN1 mutations have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, two novel mutations and a recurrent de-novo mutation were identified in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> by means of single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two novel mutations are a 4-bp deletion at nucleotide 2820-2823 and a G-to-T transversion at nucleotide 1421 (C474F), located on exon 23 and exon 11, respectively </plain></SENT>
