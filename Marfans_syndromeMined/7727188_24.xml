<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 12 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and 12 controls matched for age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transverse <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> areas of the ascending and descending aorta were measured using electrocardiographic gated magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography was used to measure the diameter of the ascending aorta and aortic arch in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure was measured during both scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In diastole, transverse <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> areas of the ascending and descending aorta were significantly greater in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> when measured by magnetic resonance imaging and corrected for body surface area; P &lt; 0.02 and P &lt; 0.05 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> had a higher stiffness index (112.77 v 5.78, P &lt; 0.05) and a lower distensibility (0.0066 v 0.0105, P &lt; 0.05) than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results produced by MRI and echocardiography were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance imaging gives good quality reproducible images of the ascending and descending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, aortic distensibility and stiffness index measured by magnetic resonance imaging were abnormal (but did not always relate directly to the size of the aorta </plain></SENT>
