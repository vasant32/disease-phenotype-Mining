<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Major features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> occur in the ocular, cardiovascular, and skeletal systems as well as in the dura mater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Approximately 60% of known disease-causing mutations are missense mutations of single amino acid residues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Effects on the cardiovascular system are classically associated with mutations in exons 24-32 of the 65 FBN1 exons and many, though not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, reports associate missense mutations in exons 59-65 with a mild cardiovascular phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we present 5 related individuals among whom a c.7409G&gt;A (p.Cys2470Tyr) missense variant in exon 59 of FBN1 is associated with significant cardiovascular features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The index case also had an apparently de novo 46,XX,del(5)(q33.1q33.3) deletion on chromosome 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This family demonstrates skeletal, dermatological and neurological features consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> but lacks significant ophthalmological findings to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that FBN1 C-terminal missense mutations may not confer the ophthalmological features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, but they also confer a more significant risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular pathology</z:e> than that suggested by previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, clinical data from this family supports the previously reported association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> with C-terminal mutations </plain></SENT>
