<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MS is caused by mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene, leading to joint ligaments flaccidity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001382'>joint hypermobility</z:hpo> and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> of the long bones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to assess anthropometry, musculoskeletal alterations and the prevalence of physical therapy treatments among patients with MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-six patients were included in this study [17 females (age: 13.23±2.77 years; body mass 51.5±24-68 Kg; height 1.70±1.40-1.81 m; arm span: 1.73±0.12 m) and 9 males (age: 14.44±2.18; body mass: 61.0±42-72 Kg; height: 1.83±1.66-1.97 m; arm span: 1.93±0.13 m)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anthropometric measurements and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151491" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">musculoskeletal abnormalities</z:e> were determined in a standardized fashion: pectus and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> were assessed through radiography and angulation (â) of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> curve using the Cobb method; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo> was assessed through the thumb sign and Walker-Murdoch test and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001519'>dolichostenomelia</z:hpo> was assessed by arm span in relation to height </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients also responded to a questionnaire addressing participation in physical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In comparison to values estimated for the Brazilian population, mass and height were greater among the patients with MS (females: p=0.001 e p&lt;0.0005 e males p=0.019 e p=0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151491" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">musculoskeletal abnormalities</z:e> were found: pectus in 3 patients (11%), pectus and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> in 19 (73%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001519'>dolichostenomelia</z:hpo> in 11 (42%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo> in 21 (80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (42%) with MS had previously undergone physical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MS exhibit altered musculoskeleto and anthropometry and have infrequent physical therapy treatment </plain></SENT>
