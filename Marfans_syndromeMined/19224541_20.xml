<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent experimental studies reported an activation of TGF-beta in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> related to Marfan (and Loeys-Dietz) syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we investigate TGF-beta signalling in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathological human ascending aortic wall in syndromic and non-syndromic aneurysmal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aneurysmal ascending aortic specimens, classified according to aetiology: syndromic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> (n = 15, including two mutations in TGFBR2), associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp> (n = 15) or degenerative forms (n = 19), were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that the amounts of TGF-beta1 protein retained within and released by aneurysmal tissue were greater than for control aortic tissue, whatever the aetiology, contrasting with an unchanged TGF-beta1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increase in stored TGF-beta1 was associated with enhanced LTBP-1 protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These dysregulations of the extracellular ligand are associated with higher phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in the ascending aortic wall from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This activation correlated with the degree of elastic fibre fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, there was no consistent association between the nuclear location of pSmad2 and extracellular TGF-beta1 and LTBP-1 staining and between their respective <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In parallel, decorin was focally increased in aneurysmal media, whereas biglycan was globally decreased in aneurysmal aortas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study highlights independent dysregulations of TGF-beta retention and Smad2 signalling in syndromic and non-syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
