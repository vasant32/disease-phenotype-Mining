<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The billowing mitral leaflet syndrome (or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220996" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Barlow's disease</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FED</z:e> can be distinguished on the basis of clinical patterns and gross features, but their histologic patterns have not been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred thirty patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine (24 males) had BD; 44 (38 males) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FED</z:e>; 15 (7 males) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (MS); and 32 patients (25 males) a non-determined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1285162" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">degenerative disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histological changes of the resected segment of the valve were quantitatively evaluated using scores of severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A discriminant analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The groups defined by the computer were checked for concordance with groups defined by the surgeon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collagen alterations were found the most severe in MS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BD and MS had the most myxoid infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FED</z:e> patients had the most elastic fiber alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No BD in males and only one in females were misclassified by the discriminant procedure into the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FED</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, the percentages of correct matchings were 54% in males and 62% in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When the age of patients and the size of ring were added to histology to determine whether this additional information provided more discrimination, the percentages of correct matchings reached 90% in males and 100% in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>BD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FED</z:e> are two fairly distinct entities, which can be distinguished by quantitative histology, whereas only modest differences were found in qualitative histology </plain></SENT>
