<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rather than evaluate each factor separately, we evaluated the early outcome of a multimodal protocol (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> field flooding, Leukoguard filter, head ice packing, electroencephalographic arrest at 20 degrees C, alpha-stat, increasing right subclavian artery cannulation, and antegrade/retrograde brain perfusion) for brain protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospectively collected data were analyzed on 403 ascending or arch aortic operations including 199 (49%) arch replacements conducted between July 25, 1991, and September 25, 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 61.6 years (range 22 to 91 years); 48 (12%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>; 141 (35%) had dissection; 134 (33%) had composite grafts inserted; and 138 (34%) had concurrent coronary bypasses performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> occurred in 2.0% (8/403) (3 permanent, 5 transient), clinical neurocognitive deficits in 2.5% (10/403) either by testing or patient complaint 2 to 3 weeks after surgery, and 98% (395/403) were 30-day survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, neurocognitive decline, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were the following: for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, aorta symptom severity grade (1 to 4) (p = 0.001), pump time (p = 0.001), arrest time (p = 0.001), macroscopic atheroma (p = 0.041), concurrent descending/thoracoabdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (p = 0.036), and highest blood rewarming temperature (p = 0.043); for neurocognitive decline, degree of cooling (p = 0.046), pump time (p = 0.001), cooling time (p = 0.001), day extubated (p = 0.042), and antegrade brain perfusion (p = 0.004); for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, pump time (p = 0.001) and clamp time (p = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The multivariable independent predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, neurocognitive decline, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were the following: for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, aorta symptoms grade (p = 0.025), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> (p = 0.043), and pump time (p = 0.015); neurocognitive decline, preoperative New York Heart Association <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> class (p = 0.022), pump time (p = 0.05), arrest time (p = 0.06), day extubated (p = 0.042), and antegrade perfusion (p = 0.023); and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, pump time (p = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pump time continues to be the most important predictor of adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The benefit of antegrade or retrograde perfusion remains unproven, partly because of the low event rate (&lt; 2.5%) but may be beneficial for prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Embolic material either from macroscopic atheroma, descending or thoracoabdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, or associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo>, increases the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
