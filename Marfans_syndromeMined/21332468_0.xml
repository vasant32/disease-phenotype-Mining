<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, diagnostic criteria were revised where more weight was given to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We applied the revised Marfan nosology in an established adult Marfan population to define practical repercussions of novel criteria for clinical practice and individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Out of 180 MFS patients, in 91% (n = 164) the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> remained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Out of 16 patients with rejected diagnosis, four patients were diagnosed as MASS (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, borderline non-progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo>, skeletal findings and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001065'>striae</z:hpo>) phenotype, three as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> syndrome and in nine patients no alternative diagnosis was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 13 patients, the diagnosis was rejected because the Z-score of the aortic root was &lt;2, although the aortic diameter was larger than 40 mm in six of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In three other patients, the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> was rejected because <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> was given less weight in the revised nosology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following the revised Marfan nosology, the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> was rejected in 9% of patients, mostly because of the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> defined as Z-score â‰¥2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Currently used Z-scores seem to underestimate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo>, especially in patients with large body surface area (BSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We recommend re-evaluation of criteria for aortic root involvement in adult patients with a suspected diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
