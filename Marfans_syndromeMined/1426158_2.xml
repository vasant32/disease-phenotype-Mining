<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elastin was extracted from the aortic samples with 5 M <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42820">guanidine</z:chebi>-HCl, <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> collagenase digestion, and dithiothreitol reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Amino acid analysis revealed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37628">desmosine</z:chebi> and isodesmosine levels were the same in Marfan calves as in control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gravimetric measurements of elastin, amino acid composition, soluble protein, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27252">uronic acid</z:chebi> values also showed no significant difference between Marfan and control tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast to elastin, collagen in aortae of Marfan calves was significantly higher than the mean of several controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings, along with other observations of this animal model, support the conclusion that the microscopic and biochemical lesions of aortic elastin in bovine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> likely result from defective microfibrillar metabolism </plain></SENT>
