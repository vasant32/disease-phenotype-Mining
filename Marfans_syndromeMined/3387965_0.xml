<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histologically, two types of alterations may be distinguished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The classical medionecrosis of Erdheim and Gsell is characterized by focal destructions of elastic fibers, while so-called mucoid degeneration of the media shows mucoid deposits between the rarified and atrophic elastic fibers but no focal destruction of the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These two lesions are clearly distinguishable in the majority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Average age and distribution among age groups are identical in both types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both groups the male patients predominate but with a different ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>True and dissecting types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> are equally distributed in medionecrosis of Erdheim and Gsell (including the cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>), but dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> predominate by a ratio of 8:1 in mucoid degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several arguments strengthen the opinion that the two types of lesion represent different disease entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The etiology of the disorder is still unknown; our findings do not show a relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> or to a simple aging process of the vessel wall </plain></SENT>
