<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our study, we reviewed 98 patients (54 males, 44 females) with echocardiographic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> diagnosed between 1991 and 1993 to study the clinical profile and echocardiographic features of patients with this condition in our local population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean and median age at presentation/detection were 42 years and 38 years respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority of the patients were asymptomatic (59%); the rest presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> (21%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (4%) and infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On clinical examination, 64 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (13 patients had both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> murmur and a systolic click), while one or more systolic clicks were heard in another 32 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six patients also had associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>2D echo revealed isolated anterior and posterior leaflet involvement in 55 and 19 patients respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Another 24 patients had involvement of both leaflets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>Mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> was detected on colour Doppler study in 78 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001704'>tricuspid valve prolapse</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 98 patients, 8 patients developed flail mitral valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four were detected at presentation/diagnosis, while the other 4 were diagnosed incidentally on routine follow-up 2D echo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of these 8 patients, one developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The patients had been on follow-up for a mean period of 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>During this period, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> progressed in 3 patients resulting in valve surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Only 20 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> detected on ambulatory ECG monitoring, most of them were frequent atrial and <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular premature beats</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>No patient was found to have haemodynamically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In summary, most patients with MVP had anterior mitral valve leaflet <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Although most patients with MVP are asymptomatic or have minor symptoms, it is associated with significant morbidity </plain></SENT>
