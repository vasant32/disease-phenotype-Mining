<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study was to assess the efficacy of total arch replacement combined with stented elephant trunk implantation for Marfan patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> Stanford type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> involving the aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 2004 and April 2006, 13 consecutive Marfan patients (4 female, 9 male) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> involving the aortic arch underwent total arch replacement combined with implantation of a stented elephant trunk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic dissection</z:hpo> extending to the iliac artery was seen in 10 patients, and to the abdominal aorta in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ages ranged from 17 to 65 years (mean, 39 +/- 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography was done to evaluate the residual false lumen in the descending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients survived and were discharged from hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the innominate artery suffered <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and recovered during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of the left upper limb postoperatively, but recovered after axillary to axillary artery bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> during the mean follow-up period of 27 +/- 10 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation was observed in 84.6% of patients (11 of 13) around the stented elephant trunk, and in 69.2% of patients (9 of 13) at the diaphragmatic level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Total arch replacement combined with stented elephant trunk implantation for Marfan patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> involving the aortic arch results in less late <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the dissected descending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>That prolongs the reoperation interval or reduces the number of late thoracoabdominal aortic replacements, unless there is a patent false lumen around the stented elephant trunk </plain></SENT>
