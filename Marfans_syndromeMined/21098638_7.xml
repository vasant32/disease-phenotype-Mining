<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the gene encoding transforming growth factor-beta receptor type II (TGFBR2) have been described in patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> type 2 (MFS2) and familial thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and dissections (TAAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we present a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of TGFBR2 expression, turnover and TGF-β-induced Smad and ERK signaling activity for nine mutations identified in patients with LDS, MFS2 and TAAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mutations had different effects on protein stability, internalization and signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A dominant-negative effect was demonstrated for mutations associated with LDS and MFS2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No mutation showed evidence of an immediate cell-autonomous paradoxical activation of TGF-β signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no cell biological differences between mutations described in patients with LDS and MFS2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, R460C, which has been found in familial TAAD but not in MFS2 or LDS, showed a less-severe dominant-negative effect and retained residual Smad phosphorylation and transcriptional activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TAAD is characterized primarily by thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> or dissections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By contrast, MFS2 is characterized by numerous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>skeletal abnormalities</z:hpo>, and patients with LDS additionally can display craniofacial and other abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our findings suggest that the balance between defects in Smad and ERK signaling might be an important determinant of phenotypic severity in disorders related to mutations in TGFBR2 </plain></SENT>
