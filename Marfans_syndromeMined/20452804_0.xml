<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Spinal imaging can detect both skeletal (including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003302'>spondylolisthesis</z:hpo>) and neurological involvement (i.e. <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to assess the interest of screening the rachis by conventional radiography CR and complementary imaging (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) in patients suspected of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, and to modelise the most relevant imaging procedure to diagnose <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity of CR of the lumbosacral spine versus sectional imaging for the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> (DE) in a subgroup of 92 patients suspected of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Retrospective analysis of the contribution of CR to the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> in 1992 patients referred to our clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DE was detected by CR in 12 of the 92 patients (13%) and was always confirmed by CT or MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complementary imaging alone detected 33 DE (35.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with DE detected by CR were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the 1992 patients, 591 were confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>; 117 patients had DE detected by CR (19,8%) while 12 (2,0%) were detected by complementary imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients, 98 (16.6%) had significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> and 14 (2.4%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003302'>spondylolisthesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value of DE detected by CR for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> was 92.9% (95% IC: 86.8-96.4), and the negative predictive value was 74.6% (95% IC: 72.6-76.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that spinal imaging is useful for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
