<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Curved MPR is used primarily for semiautomated or completely automated calculation of the centerline of the vascular lumen and to estimate the orthogonal vessel diameter and longitudinal extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reproducible and accurate measurement of complex pathologies and courses of vessels extends the range of diagnostic radiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Contemporary scanner consoles allow automated processing of maximum intensity projections (MIP) and standard MPR and their storage in PACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To improve patient selection, procedural planning, root-cause analysis postoperatively for assessment of treatment effects and to make better communication of findings to nonradiologists possible, volume rendering techniques (VRT) are a beneficial adjunct to source images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With current algorithms semiautomated segmentation is satisfactory for vessels and bones, but not for low-contrast structures (soft tissues), which still need to be segmented manually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In general, isotropic CT source data are preferable to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images, which are often anisotropic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In many European countries image postprocessing is still not adequately reimbursed although the doctors making referrals often specifically and emphatically demand 3D visualization and measurements in daily practice </plain></SENT>
