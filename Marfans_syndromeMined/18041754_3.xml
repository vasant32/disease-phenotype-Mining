<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 35 cases in 31 patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002108'>spontaneous pneumothorax</z:hpo> were identified over a 10-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was one case of bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo> and three cases of recurrent pneumothoraces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four cases (69%) required intercostal tube catheter drainage for a mean of 4.9 days (range 2-10 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven cases, including two cases in CF patients, and three cases in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's Syndrome</z:e> proceeded to a secondary surgical procedure after a continuing air leak was present for an average of 5.9 days (range 2-16 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In follow-up studies on 11 cases, 5 (45%) were found to have apical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002088'>abnormalities of the lung</z:hpo> on CT scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pneumothoraces were identified in six cases of patients with cystic <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> as well as four in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's Syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This present study has suggested that unless intercostal catheter treatment resolves the air leak associated with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002108'>spontaneous pneumothorax</z:hpo> within 5 days that surgical intervention is most likely to be required to achieve a full resolution </plain></SENT>
