<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze aortic root growth in 113 men and 108 women with MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were prospectively followed with serial echocardiograms of the native aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At baseline, women had on average a 5-mm smaller aortic root diameter adjusted for age than men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Average aortic root growth was 0.42 mm/year (SE 0.05) in men and 0.38 mm/year (SE 0.04) in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the basis of aortic root growth rates, the men and women could be divided into 2 normally distributed subgroups: fast and slow growers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Approximately 1 in 7 men (1.5 mm/year, SE 0.5) and approximately 1 in 9 women (1.8 mm/year, SE 0.3) had fast-growing aortic root diameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significantly more type A dissections (25% vs 4%, p &lt;0.001) were observed in fast growers than in slow growers; this was found in men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Type A dissections were observed in 4 men and 9 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By reducing the cut-off value by 5 mm for elective aortic root replacement in women, type A dissections could have been prevented in 3 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, guidelines should take gender differences into account, and therefore, the investigators propose reducing the threshold for elective aortic root replacement in women with MS by 5 mm </plain></SENT>
