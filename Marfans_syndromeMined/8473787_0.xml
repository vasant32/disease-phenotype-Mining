<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fifty four patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (n = 35) or dissections (n = 19) associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> underwent the replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic valve by composite valve graft during 15-year period between September 1976 and December 1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these, 49 (90.7%) patients had an annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> and 26 (48.1%) had the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The methods of coronary artery reattachment to the graft were as follows: direct reattachment (original Bentall's technique) in 45 patients, aortic button technique (Carrel's patch technique) in 6, Cabrol's technique in 2 and Piehler's technique in 1 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven patients with a DeBakey type I dissection had concomitant replacement of the aortic arch with an aid of selective cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall hospital mortality rate was 12.9%, and it has significantly decreased to 6.7% since we adopted a cold cardioplegia, preclotting the graft with albumin autoclave technique and coronary artery reattachment using conventional over-and-over and interrupted mattress sutures with pledgets during the last 10-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of follow-up period was 58.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival rate at 10 years for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 76.4%; for those with dissection, 78.4%; and for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, 70.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reoperation for the prosthesis-related complications was necessary in only one patient, although operations on the remainder of aorta were required in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Actuarial freedom from these operations at 10 years was 74.1%, but it was 69.3% for the subgroup with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present data indicates that composite valve graft technique is an useful method for patients with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> or dissections </plain></SENT>
