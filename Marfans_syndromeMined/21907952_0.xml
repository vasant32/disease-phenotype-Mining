<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic testing of the disease-causing fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) is also important in this diagnostic scheme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to define the clinical characteristics of Japanese patients with MS and enable the efficient and accurate diagnosis of MS with mutational analysis using a high-throughput microarray-based resequencing system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three Japanese probands were recruited, and their clinical characteristics were evaluated using the Ghent criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For mutational analysis, an oligonucleotide microarray was designed to interrogate FBN1, and the entire exon and exon-intron boundaries of FBN1 were sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical evaluation revealed more pulmonary phenotypes and fewer skeletal phenotypes in Japanese patients with MS compared to Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The microarray-based resequencing system detected 35 kinds of mutations, including 23 new mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mutation detection rate for patients who fulfilled the Ghent criteria reached 71% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of note, splicing mutations accounted for 19% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mutations, which is more than previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this comprehensive approach successfully detected clinical phenotypes of Japanese patients with MS and demonstrated the usefulness and feasibility of this microarray-based high-throughput resequencing system for mutational analysis of MS </plain></SENT>
