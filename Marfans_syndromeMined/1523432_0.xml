<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two methods were used from among the several variations quoted in the literature, one involving the average length/width of metacarpals 2-5 (method I), and the other dividing the sum of the lengths by the sum of the widths of these metacarpals (method II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two methods are not mathematically identical, and a statistically significant difference was noted between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only 50% of the children in each group had elevated metacarpal indices, making it a time-consuming method that is indicative only of the phenotype and can be found in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It should therefore be considered an <z:mp ids='MP_0002180'>obsolete</z:mp> measurement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
