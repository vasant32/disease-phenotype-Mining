<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The clinical profiles and outcomes of patients treated surgically for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (ABAD) are often reported for those in small series or for those cared for at a single institution over a long time period, during which a continuous evolution in techniques has occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we sought to evaluate the clinical features and surgical results of patients enrolled in the International Registry of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic Dissection</z:hpo> by identifying primary factors that influenced surgical outcome and estimating average surgical mortality for ABAD in the current era </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A comprehensive analysis of 290 clinical variables and their relation to surgical outcomes for 82 patients who required surgery for ABAD (from a population of 1256 patients; mean+/-SD age, 60.6+/-15.0 years; 82.9% male) and who were enrolled in the International Registry of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic Dissection</z:hpo> was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall in-hospital mortality was 29.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with increased surgical mortality based on univariate analysis were preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> or altered consciousness, partial <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the false lumen, evidence of periaortic <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> on diagnostic imaging, descending aortic diameter &gt;6 cm, right ventricle dysfunction at surgery, and shorter time from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with favorable outcomes included radiating pain, normotension at surgery (systolic blood pressure 100 to 149 mm Hg), and reduced hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 2 independent predictors of surgical mortality were age &gt;70 years (odds ratio, 4.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.30 to 14.34) and preoperative shock/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (odds ratio, 6.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.12 to 32.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides insights into current-day clinical profiles and surgical outcomes of ABAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Knowledge about different preoperative clinical conditions may help surgeons in making treatment decisions among these high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
