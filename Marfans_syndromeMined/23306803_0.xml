<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to the classic equation (Z1) for calculating Z-scores, two new equations were recently introduced (Z2 and Z3).Methods:We studied the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, age, and the absolute cut point of 40 mm on these three equations in 2,674 echocardiographic measurements of 260 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>.Results:Diameters ≥40 mm were associated with Z1 scores &lt;2.0 in 109 measurements (11.0%; 35 patients), Z2 scores &lt;2.0 in 37 measurements (3.8%; 13 patients), and Z3 scores &lt;2.0 in 24 measurements (2.4%; 11 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean diameters increased after the 40th birthday: 42.0 (37.3-44.8 mm interquartile range) to 42.5 (39.0-45.0 mm interquartile range; P = not significant) and mean Z1 scores decreased from 3.60 to 2.17 (P &lt; 0.01), whereas Z2 and Z3 scores tended to increase (Z2: 3.04-3.27; Z3: 3.39-3.55; P = not significant for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparing Z-scores between patients with body mass index &lt;25 kg/m² (group A) and those with body mass index ≥25 kg/m² (group B), median Z1 scores differed between groups (Z1 = 3.00 in group A, Z1 = 1.78 in group B; P = 0.012), whereas Z2 (Z2 = 2.82 in group A, Z2 = 2.47 in group B; P = 0.52) and Z3 scores (Z3 = 2.72 in group A, Z2 = 3.12 in group B; P = 0.32) did not.Conclusion:Z1 scores are inferior to Z2 and Z3 scores in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
