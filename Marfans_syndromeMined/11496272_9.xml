<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> of the innominate artery (AIA) are widely considered to be a rare entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe our experience with AIAs in the last three decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From October 1973 to October 2000, we operated on 27 patients with an AIA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The underlying cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu's disease</z:e> in 7 patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1285162" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">degenerative disease</z:e> in 6 patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> in 5 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection in 3 patients, trauma in 2 patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in 2 patients, a postoperative complication in 1 patient, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AIA was associated with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> in 17 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had no symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients had symptoms, with thromboembolic complications in 7 patients, pain without rupture in 3 patients, and a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two patients at high risk for surgery who had a small AIA with embolic complications, a cervical approach was used as a means of performing distal exclusion and crossover bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 25 patients, a midline sternotomy was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient with a ruptured AIA exsanguinated during sternotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ten patients underwent a prosthetic replacement of the ascending aorta and/or aortic arch with a separate prosthetic branch to the innominate artery (IA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients underwent ascending aorta-to-IA prosthetic bypass in association with lateral suture (8 patients) or prosthetic patching (5 patients) of the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient with an infected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was treated by means of resection of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, proximal ligation of the IA, and transposition of the right into the left common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Cardiopulmonary bypass with deep hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> was used in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred (2 of 4 in association with emergency treatment and 1 of 23 with elective treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Respiratory complications requiring prolonged artificial ventilation developed in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Two patients had transient worsening of preoperative neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Late results, with a mean follow-up of 85 months, were good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The etiology and presentation of AIAs are variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Surgical management with current cardiovascular techniques achieves excellent results </plain></SENT>
