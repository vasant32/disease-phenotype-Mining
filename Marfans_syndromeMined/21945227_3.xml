<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Despite the positive clinical results of valve-sparing aortic root replacement, little is known about the causes of reoperations and the modes of failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From October 1999 to June 2010, 101 patients underwent valve-sparing aortic root replacement using the David reimplantation technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The definition of aortic root repair failure included the following: (1) intraoperative conversion to the Bentall procedure; (2) reoperation performed because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>; and (3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> equal to or greater than a moderate degree at the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients were considered to have repair failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients required intraoperative conversion to valve replacement, 3 required reoperation within 3 months, and another 8 required reoperation during postoperative follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At initial surgery 5 patients had moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, 6 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo>, 3 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, 2 had status post Ross operations, 3 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valves</z:hpo>, and 1 had <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five patients had undergone cusp repair, including Arantius plication in 3 and plication at the commissure in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The causes of early failure in 6 patients included cusp <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> (3), cusp <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> (3), and severe <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The causes of late failure in 10 patients included cusp <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> (4), commissure dehiscence (3), torn cusp (2), and cusp retraction (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients had valve replacements at a mean of 23 Â± 20.9 months after reimplantation and survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Causes of early failure after valve-sparing root replacement included technical failure, cusp lesions, and steep learning curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Late failure was caused by aortic root wall degeneration due to gelatin-resorcin-formalin glue, cusp degeneration, or progression of cusp <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
