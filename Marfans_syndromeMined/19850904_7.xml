<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Even though elastin and fibrillin-1 are the major structural components of elastic fibers, mutations in elastin and fibrillin-1 lead to narrowing of large arteries in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004381'>supravalvular aortic stenosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005111'>dilation of the ascending aorta</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A genetic approach was therefore used here to distinguish the differential contributions of elastin and fibrillin-1 to arterial development and compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Key parameters of cardiovascular function were compared among adult mice haploinsufficient for elastin (Eln(+/-)), fibrillin-1 (Fbn1(+/-)), or both proteins (dHet) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physiological and morphological comparisons correlate elastin haploinsufficiency with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0497247,C0020538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">increased blood pressure</z:e> and vessel length and tortuosity in dHet mice, and fibrillin-1 haploinsufficiency with increased aortic diameter in the same mutant animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mechanical tests confirm that elastin and fibrillin-1 impart elastic recoil and tensile strength to the aortic wall, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional ex vivo analyses demonstrate additive and overlapping contributions of elastin and fibrillin-1 to the material properties of vascular tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lastly, light and electron microscopy evidence implicates fibrillin-1 in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>-promoted remodeling of the elastin-deficient aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that elastin and fibrillin-1 have both differential and complementary roles in arterial wall formation and function, and advance our knowledge of the structural determinants of vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> and disease </plain></SENT>
