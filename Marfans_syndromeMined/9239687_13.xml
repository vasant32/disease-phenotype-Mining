<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report the world's first use of preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) to achieve a clinical pregnancy and live birth of a baby free of a Marfan mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One or two blastomeres from each embryo were tested for a CA repeat within the FBN-1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prospective mother is homozygous for the CA repeat (2/2) and has two <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> copies of the FBN-1 gene, while the prospective father is heterozygous for the CA repeat (1/2), and is affected with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For PGT, any embryo diagnosed as heterozygous for the CA repeat (1/2) would be presumed to have inherited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> FBN-1 genes from the father and the mother and be unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One in-vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle yielded 12 embryos for preimplantation testing; six of the embryos were heterozygous for the CA repeat (1/2) and presumed to be free of the Marfan mutation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The fetus was tested by chorionic villus sampling and found to be free of the Marfan mutation by the same linkage analysis, had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fetal echocardiogram, and was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at birth </plain></SENT>
