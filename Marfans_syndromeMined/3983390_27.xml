<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of these patients were eventually shown to have dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In most instances the diagnosis was established by aortography and/or computed tomography (CT) prior to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgical proof (6/13) and/or aortographic proof (10/13) were available in 11/13 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> demonstrated the intimal flap and determined whether the dissection was type A or type B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>: differentiated between the true and false lumens; determined the origins of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">celiac</z:e>, superior mesenteric, and renal arteries from the true or false lumen in the cases where the dissection extended into the abdominal aorta (8/12); allowed post-surgical surveillance of the dissection; and identified aortoannular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> in the three patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to the 13 cases with dissection, there were two cases in whom the diagnosis of dissection was excluded by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our early experience suggests that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> can serve as the initial imaging test in clinically suspected cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and that the information provided by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> is sufficient to manage many cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> obviates the use of iodinated contrast media </plain></SENT>
