<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to define patient characteristics, outcomes, and associated factors after mitral valve replacement in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included 104 children undergoing at least one mitral valve replacement between 1980 and 2003 and reviewed clinical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Competing-risks methodology was used to determine time-related prevalence and associated risk factors after initial mitral valve replacement for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and repeat replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264765,C0026265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral valve disease</z:e> was congenital in 83%, rheumatic in 13%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in 3%, and isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> in 1%, with 64% having primarily regurgitation, 16% having stenosis, 20% having both, and 32% having undergone previous valvotomy, valvuloplasty, or repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 137 valve replacements, with 26 patients having more than one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Valve prosthesis type was St Jude Medical in 37%, Bjork-Shiley in 25%, Carbomedics in 20%, Ionescu-Shiley in 10%, and other types in 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both early and late complications were common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median age at the initial replacement was 5.9 years (range, birth to 19 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Competing-risks analysis predicted 19% to have died at 15 years after initial replacement, with risk factors including noncongenital valve <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, lower weight, and longer duration of cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A repeat replacement was predicted for 71%, with risk factors including the presence of multiple left-heart obstructive lesions and Ionescu-Shiley valve prosthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mitral valve replacement might be necessary in children with extremely dysplastic valves and severe hemodynamic impairment or after failed repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, with the appropriate selection of the prosthetic valve and reduction of cardiopulmonary bypass time, surgeons might decrease mortality and increase prosthesis longevity </plain></SENT>
