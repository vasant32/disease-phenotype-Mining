<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>FBN1, the gene mutated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, encodes fibrillin-1, a large <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> component of the extracellular microfibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Human FBN1 has three untranslated upstream exons, and homologous sequences can be identified in a number of mammalian species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this work, we have used functional assays to characterize the FBN1 upstream region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sequences upstream of exon 1 and at least two of the upstream untranslated exons were shown to possess promoter activity in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The strongest activity in luciferase assays was shown for sequences upstream of the untranslated exon A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of the sequences in and upstream of exon A in humans and six other mammalian species demonstrated several highly conserved potential cis-acting sequences as well as a 66-basepair (bp) ultraconserved sequence with nearly perfect conservation in the seven species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ultraconserved sequence contains an initiator element (Inr), a downstream promoter element (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="39161">DPE</z:chebi>), and a 10-bp palindromic element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutational assays showed that both the Inr and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39161">DPE</z:chebi> are critical for full promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A mutation of the 10-bp palindromic element completely abolished basal promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The element was shown to bind specifically to an unknown nuclear protein by electrophoretic mobility shift assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ultraconservation within an alternate promoter has not been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the ultraconservation may reflect the importance of finely tuned regulation of alternate transcription of FBN1 and that the sequences involved have been under negative selective pressure for at least the last 180 million years of mammalian evolution </plain></SENT>
