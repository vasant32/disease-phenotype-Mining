<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experience with treatment options-sex steroid or somatostatin analogue-for height reduction in girls is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have evaluated our experience of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> treatment in girls with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> attending the pediatric <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> clinic in Glasgow between 1989 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Retrospective case note analysis combined with ascertainment of final/near final height, comparing outcome in treated and untreated girls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular health was assessed by examining aortic root diameter and blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study cohort comprised four treated and five untreated girls, of whom three were sisters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment was started in the four girls at chronological age 10.0 (2.1) years, mean (SD) height 155.0 (9.8) cm, and Tanner breast stage B1 in three and B2 in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4903">Ethinyl estradiol</z:chebi> was administered in stepwise incremental regimens, starting at 10 microg/day and reaching 100 microg/day after 10 weeks in two girls and starting at 2 microg/day and reaching a maximum of 30-50 microg/day over a 2- to 3-year period in two girls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean +/- SD (range) final/near final height of the four treated girls was 174.3 (2.6) (170.6-176.6) cm compared with 183.0 (6.9) (171.5-190.3) cm in the five untreated girls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred in the treated group while one untreated girl died from presumed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> aged 18 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Aortic root diameter increased with age, by mean (SD) 5.0 (2.1) and 5.8 (4.5) mm in treated and untreated groups, respectively, but with no between-group differences after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> doses used in this study are lower than in previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results, although unsuitable for statistical analysis due to small numbers, are encouraging with no adverse events being recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Future research should be multicenter in design </plain></SENT>
