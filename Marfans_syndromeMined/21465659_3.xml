<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JPS</z:e> due to mutations in SMAD4 are at greater risk to manifest signs of hereditary hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo> (HHT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HHT is caused by either mutations in SMAD4 or other genes that modulate transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional genes in the TGFβ network include FBN1, TGFBR1, and TGFBR2, mutations of which cause either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) or Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As SMAD4, FBN1, and TGFBR1/2 map to different regions of the genome, disorders associated with mutations in these genes are not expected to co-segregate in a family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We report an individual whose family history was positive for aortopathy, mitral valve dysfunction, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JPS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutation analysis of SMAD4 implicates this gene for these phenotypes in this family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although SMAD4 is among several genes in the TGFβ network, and although prior single case reports have described large vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in HHT, this is the first description of aortic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0865573" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral disease</z:e> presenting with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JPS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This observation suggests that, in addition to HHT, individuals with SMAD4 mutations may be at risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0010574'>aortic dilation</z:mp> and mitral valve dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We emphasize the importance of comprehensive review of the medical history prior to molecular testing, especially in an asymptomatic patient </plain></SENT>
