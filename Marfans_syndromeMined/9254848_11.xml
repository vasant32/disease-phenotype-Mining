<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A novel FBN1 mutation was identified using temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis of a reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction product spanning exons 14 to 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mutation, G1760A, is predicted to result in the amino acid substitution C587Y and thus to disrupt one of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bonds of the calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like module encoded by exon 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>C587Y was found to be a de novo mutation in a relatively mildly affected 15-year-old girl whose clinical phenotype was characterized mainly by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002943'>thoracic scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Metabolic labeling of cultured dermal fibroblasts from the affected patient demonstrated delayed secretion of fibrillin with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> synthesis and no decrease in incorporation into the extracellular matrix compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin immunostaining of confluent dermal fibroblast cultures revealed no visible difference between the patient's cells and control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Characterization of many different FBN1 mutations from different regions of the gene may provide a better understanding of clinical and biochemical genotype-phenotype relationships </plain></SENT>
