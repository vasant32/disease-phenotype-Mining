<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most common cause of late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is progression of disease in the remaining aorta (dissection or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to review our clinical experience with composite graft replacement of the aortic root with special reference to long term results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-six patients (mean age: 53 years) with different pathologies of the ascending aorta underwent aortic root replacement with a composite-graft prosthesis over a 12-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients had previously undergone cardiovascular surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The surgical technique included resection of the ascending aorta with the aortic valve and end-to-side anastomosis between full-thickness buttons of the aortic wall with the coronary ostia and the graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One or more associated cardiovascular procedures were performed in 24 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Long term follow up to July 1995 is complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Uni- and multivariate analysis were performed to identify risk-factors for early and late mortality and reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-three patients died during the first 30 days (18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of them had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most common cause of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients died during the follow up time with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, again, being the most common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thirteen late reoperations on the composite-graft or the remaining aorta were performed in 12 patients, six of whom had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The 30-day mortality at reoperation was 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This surgical option offers good long term results with a five-year actuarial survival of 67% or 75% when the 30-day mortality is excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Careful follow up of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> is mandatory to increase the long term survival </plain></SENT>
