<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A Presentation of the TRS Project: Counselling and (Re)habilitation Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A Model Project in Organizing Services for Low Frequency Diagnostic Groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Persons with low frequency disabilities often require services from a number of professions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient organizations claim that the patients themselves often have to coordinate their own treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The TRS project has been established as one of the initiatives under the Norwegian Government's Plan of Action for the Disabled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The project is one of three national projects designed to develop models for the coordination of services for persons with low frequency congenital disabilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The TRS project deals with the following five diagnoses: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, arthrogryphosis multiplex congenita, <z:mp ids='MP_0009929'>myelomeningocele</z:mp>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002414'>spina bifida</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029434" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteogenesis imperfecta</z:e> and congenital limb deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The project is based on patient (user) participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The five patient organizations are represented on the board where they are in the majority </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients along with professionals give lectures during group stays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The project offers its services to persons with the diagnosis from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parts of Norway (4.3 mill </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>inhabitants) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002414'>spina bifida</z:hpo> over 16 years are included in the project, as well as persons with the other diagnoses at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We present the organization of the project and the repertoire of services that are on offer </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive Deficits</z:hpo> Often Seen in Young Adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002414'>Spina Bifida</z:hpo>: Effects in the School and Work Place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>As survival rates continue to increase with the use of shunting procedures for persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002414'>spina bifida</z:hpo> (SB), the need for improved educational and vocational planning also increases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Orbeck and Schanke reported that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> of young adults with SB have not received enough attention in educational and vocational planning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A thorough description of these deficits will aid in developing more effective individualized planning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>With improved planning, insight into alternative methods for improving support may also then be investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to better define and describe the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> often encountered while planning support in the school and work place for this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological examinations are the basis for this description of observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The study included 46 young adults with SB aged 15 to 38 living in Norway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> persons were given a neuropsychological test battery which included tests for attention, memory, speed of information processing, visual perception and visual constructive function, arithmetic, fine motor coordination, and verbal functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The results indicated deficits in fine motor coordination, speed of information processing, and a slow learning curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The consequences of these deficits in educational and vocational planning are discussed and guidelines for further studies are suggested </plain></SENT>
