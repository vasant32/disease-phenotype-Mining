<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether excessive upper airway collapsibility during sleep is an important pathophysiologic factor predisposing these individuals to OSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured upper airway closing pressures (UACP) during sleep in 12 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and 6 age-, and height-, and weight-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten of the patients had OSA, defined as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>/<z:mp ids='MP_0001956'>hypopnea</z:mp> index &gt; 5 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only two control subjects demonstrated upper airway closure </plain></SENT>
