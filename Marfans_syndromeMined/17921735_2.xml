<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Techniques of aortic root replacement have been developed that preserve the native aortic valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These techniques avoid anticoagulation in patients who would otherwise receive a composite valve graft with a mechanical valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: Longer-term data on the longevity of the main two techniques of aortic valve-sparing operations, the root remodeling and the valve reimplantation technique, are now becoming available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Root remodeling appears to have acceptable outcomes in patients without annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In such patients, the aortic valve reimplantation technique provides superior longevity because it provides external support for the aortic annulus and prevents ongoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: Although aortic valve-sparing operations are being performed more frequently, particularly in younger patient populations, these procedures have not been adopted in the current guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The excellent long-term outcomes of such procedures should facilitate their widespread adoption </plain></SENT>
