<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several calves, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sired by a phenotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bull, were found to exhibit the major clinical and pathological characteristics of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001388'>joint laxity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>lens dislocation</z:hpo>), and were recognized as potential models of the human disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, Fbn1 cDNA from affected animals was sequenced and a heterozygous c.3598G &gt; A transition was detected in exon 29, which predicted the substitution of an evolutionarily conserved glutamic acid by lysine at position 1200 (p.E1200K) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This residue is part of a calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like (cbEGF-like) module, a domain that is frequently altered in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of genomic DNA from the original bull's sperm showed that less than 20% of the sperm harbored the mutation, consistent with the presence of germline mosaicism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study validates the use of these animals as models of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These cows will be valuable for investigations into the molecular pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, and may lead to better therapeutic testing and evaluation of human Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
