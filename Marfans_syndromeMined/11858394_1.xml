<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Reviewing charts from January 1991 to June 2000, we studied 110 patients (123 eyes) who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001132'>lens subluxation</z:hpo> at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For 21 eyes, patients accepted conservative treatment, and 102 eyes underwent surgery (8 eyes had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>; 18 eyes had idiopathic dislocation; and 76 eyes had experienced trauma) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indications of surgery included reduction in visual acuity, uncorrectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">refractive error</z:e>, and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 81 male and 29 female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their mean age was 47.6 years (range, 2-76 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean post-operative follow-up period was 22.24 months (range, 2-118 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In spite of the different lens statuses, similar visual results were found between the surgical treatment group and the nonsurgery group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the surgery group, 47 eyes (46.1%) achieved best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/40 or better </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of 80 eyes (78.4%) achieved an improvement (log MAR change &gt;0.3) in BCVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The major postoperative complications included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> (11 eyes), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> (9 eyes) and intraocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>lens dislocation</z:hpo> into the vitreous cavity (3 eyes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that the presence of a subluxated lens alone is not an absolute indication for surgical removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The lens status had no significant influence on surgical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Most cases can achieve an improvement in BCVA after appropriate management </plain></SENT>
