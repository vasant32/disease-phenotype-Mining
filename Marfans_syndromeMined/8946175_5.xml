<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the absence of polymorphic markers reported for FBLN2, direct sequencing of the gene was performed and two intragenic polymorphisms were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Linkage was excluded between FBLN2 and the MFS2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, two-point lod scores were generated between these markers and anonymous markers arrayed on the genetic map of 3p and closely linked to MFS2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These analyses placed FBLN2 at marker D3S1585 </plain></SENT>
