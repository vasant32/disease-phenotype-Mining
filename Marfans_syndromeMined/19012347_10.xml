<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) is based on evaluating a large number of clinical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have observed that many persons presenting in specialized centers for "Marfan-like" features do not have <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, but exhibit a large spectrum of other syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The spectrum of these syndromes and the distribution of "Marfan-like" features remain to be characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, we prospectively evaluated 279 consecutive patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> (144 men and 135 women at a mean age of 34+/-13 years) for presence of 27 clinical criteria considered characteristic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most frequent reasons to refer individuals for suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> were skeletal features (31%), a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, or aortic complications (29%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (19%), and eye manifestations (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using established criteria, we confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> in 138 individuals (group 1) and diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0810058" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">other connective tissue diseases</z:e>, both with vascular involvement in 30 (group 2) and without vascular involvement in 39 (group 3), and excluded any distinct disease in 72 individuals (group 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> were present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patient groups and there was no single clinical criterion that exhibited positive and negative likelihood ratios that were per se sufficient to confirm or rule out <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that "Marfan-like" features are not exclusively indicative of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> but also of numerous, alternative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inherited diseases</z:e> with many of them carrying a hitherto poorly defined cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These alternative diseases require future study to characterize their responses to therapy and long-term prognosis </plain></SENT>
