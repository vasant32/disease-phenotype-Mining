<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical relevance of left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) strain in adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> without significant valvular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (n = 50; mean age, 35.2 ± 12.9 years) were followed prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography was performed annually and consisted of comprehensive assessment of ventricular and valvular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using speckle-tracking imaging, the baseline strain values of the Marfan population were calculated and compared with the values of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The follow-up evaluations were used to assess changes in ventricular strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association between the incidence of adverse events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, [supra]<z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and proximal aorta surgery) and baseline strain values was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with controls, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> had significantly lower peak longitudinal LV strain (-18.9 ± 2.3% vs -20.1 ± 1.9%, P &lt; .01) and RV strain (±26.9 ± 5.2% vs ��29.3 ± 4.25%, P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The absolute changes in LV longitudinal, radial, and circumferential strain and RV longitudinal strain during a median 4 years of follow-up were 0.1 ± 2.8%, 1.12 ± 7.6%, 0.3 ± 3.7%, and 0.9 ± 5.5%, respectively, which was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cox regression demonstrated that reduced LV or RV strain was not associated with adverse outcome (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, n = 3; proximal aorta surgery, n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> show lower ventricular strain and strain rate values compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, no relevant changes in LV and RV function occurred during midterm follow-up in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> without valvular disease at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although ventricular strain and strain rate were mildly reduced in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, this did not affect outcomes negatively in the present study </plain></SENT>
