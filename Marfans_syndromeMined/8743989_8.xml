<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We introduce here a novel and generally applicable, solid-phase minisequencing-based approach for rapid estimation of relative levels of transcripts with high sequence homology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to screen for the consequences of different fibrillin-1 mutations on the transcript levels in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This dominantly inherited, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> is characterized by pleiotrophic symptoms in cardiovascular, skeletal, and ocular systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A spectrum of disease mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin-1 (FBN1), a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> component of extracellular matrix microfibrils, has been identified in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients, but the mechanisms by which mutations result in different phenotypic manifestations are still unknown to a large extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data from the quantitation of FBN1 transcripts provide support for the hypothesis that mutations causing premature stop codons result in a milder phenotype than classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> by reducing the stability of the mutant transcript and, consequently, decreasing the interference of mutant <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> in the formation of fibrillin fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also applied this <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> quantitation method to determine the relative ratio between transcripts from the genes coding for two highly homologous microfibrillar components, FBN1 and FBN2, in control fibroblast cultures as well as in fibroblasts from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, these data show large variations between the levels of the two transcripts in fibroblast cultures, but these variations do not correlate either with the nature of the disease mutation or to the clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> phenotype </plain></SENT>
