<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000776'>diaphragmatic hernias</z:hpo> occur as isolated malformations, additional major and minor anomalies are common and are present in more than 40% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are compelling data for the importance of genetic factors in the etiology of CDH, but the pathogenesis and the causative genes for CDH in humans remain elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There are more than 70 syndromes in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000776'>diaphragmatic hernias</z:hpo> have been described, and several of these syndromes are single gene disorders for which the gene is known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One method for identifying the causative genes in isolated CDH is to study syndromes with known genes in which CDH is a recognized feature, with the rationale that those genes have a role in diaphragm development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This review discusses the syndromes that are most commonly associated with CDH, with greater attention towards syndromes in which the causative genes have been identified, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0796154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDYS">Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0950121" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Denys-Drash syndrome</z:e>, spondylocostal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013393" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dysostosis</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220767" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CFNS|CFND">craniofrontonasal syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270972" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="CDL|CDLS|BDLS|CDLS1">Cornelia de Lange syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
