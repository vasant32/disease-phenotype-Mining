<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We report the case of a 41-year-old woman with bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001132'>lens subluxation</z:hpo> and medically uncontrolled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> in whom <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The patient underwent complete clinical eye and systemic examinations and blood samples were drawn for mutational screening of fibrillin 1 gene (FBN1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patient was diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> on a clinical basis and according to the Ghent criteria and the genetic testing revealed a novel heterozygous mutation in the FBN1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient required pars plana vitrectomy with lensectomy and Ahmed valve implantation in the vitreous cavity to control her severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of a bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0012019'>lens luxation</z:hpo> must be followed by complete systemic examination and genetic analysis of the FBN1 gene in order to discard <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> due to its severe systemic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Frequently, the condition causes an aggressive secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> that requires surgical treatment with lensectomy, vitrectomy, and drainage device implantation in order to avoid its devastating progression toward glaucomatous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
