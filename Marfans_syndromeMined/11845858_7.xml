<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection, an unresected dissection and residual false lumina are causes of the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and ruptures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We grafted the ascending aorta and total arch, the maximum grafting possible through a median sternotomy alone, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with type A dissection extending to the descending aorta, wherever initial tears existed in the arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 37 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection underwent ascending and total arch grafting between August 1994 and December 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral protection was achieved by selective cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The distal anastomosis was conducted using the "Elephant Trunk" technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patent false lumina were evaluated using computed tomography 3 months after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The hospital mortality was 8.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No major cerebral complications were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of residual thoracic patent false lumina was 26.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Univariate analyses showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and preoperative extension of false lumina to be statistically significant determinants of residual thoracic false lumina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, no other significant independent predictor of residual false lumina in the thoracic aorta was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes of our strategy were satisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, residual thoracic false lumina could not be prevented in 26.5% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, this extended operation is indicated in patients with initial tears in the aortic arch or distal arch, those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and young patients with preoperative patent false lumina extending to the abdominal aorta </plain></SENT>
