<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It causes a myriad of distinct clinical problems, of which the musculoskeletal, cardiac, and ocular system problems predominate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nearly 50 percent of patients have to undergo aortic surgery in their lifetime resulting in reconstruction or replacement of the aortic root or total of this vessel's parts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe a Nigerian family with multiple cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and discuss current cardiovascular management of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS: Detailed history, clinical and laboratory investigations including ophthalmologic assessment and echocardiography were carried out on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> members of a nuclear family of a child who reported with complaints of poor eye sight later diagnosed to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> was made in three members of the nuclear family--a father and his two children following eye examination of one of the children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Afollow up cardiovascular assessment revealed that the father required aortic surgery while the two children also had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This report underlines the importance of a detailed history, physical examination and family study in patient assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Current cardiovascular management in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> involves a blocker therapy and an annual cardiovascular evaluation involving clinical history, examination and echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic aortic surgery should be considered when aortic diameter at the sinus valsalva exceeds 50 mm </plain></SENT>
