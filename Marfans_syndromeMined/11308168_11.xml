<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The extent of proximal and distal aortic resection that should be performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1984 to 1999, 119 patients underwent repair of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Distal resection was to the ascending aorta in 78 (66%) and hemiarch in 41 (34%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Proximally, the aortic valve was preserved in 69 (58%) patients, 40 (34%) underwent composite valve grafting, and 10 (8%) underwent separate graft and valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Operative mortality was higher for separate graft and valve (50%+/-16%) than for valve preservation (16%+/-5%) or composite grafts (20%+/-7%) (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hemiarch replacement did not increase operative risk compared to distal reconstruction to the ascending aorta (17%+/-6% versus 22%+/-5%, p &gt; 0.71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 10 years, freedom from reoperation was 81%+/-7% and long-term survival was 60%+/-8%, but neither was related to the proximal or distal surgical technique (p &gt; 0.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for late reoperation included a nonresected primary tear and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An aggressive surgical approach, including a full root or hemiarch replacement, is not associated with increased operative risk and should be considered when type A dissections extensively involve the valve, sinuses, or arch </plain></SENT>
