<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred forty-five patients (95 men, 50 women) encountered from 1992 to 2001 with thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo>-excluding those associated with trauma, those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, and those with thoracoabdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo>-were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most common risk factors included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (59%) and a history of tobacco use (52%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Type III dissections affected 86 patients (59%), and type I dissections affected the remaining 59 patients (41%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aortic computed tomography (CT) scans were obtained annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five patients (3%) had a history of AAA repair prior to their thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> diagnosis-3 were type III dissections and 2 were type I dissections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve patient's (8%) AAAs were diagnosed with the initial CT study of their thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Type III dissections accounted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one of these (11 of 12, 92%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten additional AAAs (7%) developed in the 128 patients with no initial evidence of an AAA being recognized from 1 to 48 months (average 16 months) after the thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Type III dissections affected 8 of these 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among the total 27 AAAs noted in this series, 74% (20 AAAs) were not continuous with the thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the univariate analysis, age (P =.0002), male gender (P =.044), history of smoking (P =.01), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> (P &lt;.001), duration of dissection (P =.05), and presence of type III dissection (P =.009) were associated with the presence of an AAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, both <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> (odds ratio 5.4, 95% CI, 1.3 to 22.3; P =.02) and age (OR 1.06, 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.11; P =.004) were significant predictors of the development of AAAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study documented that patients with thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> are at risk to harbor or develop a later AAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This finding supports the tenet that abdominal CTs or ultrasound scanning should be mandatory in the follow-up of patients with known thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
