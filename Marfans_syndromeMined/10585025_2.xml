<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We investigated long-term outcomes of the distal false lumen of the aorta and aortic branches after distal anastomosis of the graft only to the true lumen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From November 1979 until June 1998, we treated 98 patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and underwent replacement of the descending aorta, 79 of whom had distal anastomosis to the true lumen only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">celiac</z:e> artery originated from the false lumen in 11 patients, superior mesenteric artery in 5, right renal artery in 19, and left renal artery in 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 12 (15.1%) early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752130" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Spinal cord ischemia</z:e> was detected in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperative follow-up was achieved in 67 patients, and 13 patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperative survival at 10 years was 67.6% +/- 7.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had complete occlusion of the distal false lumen, 54 patients had occlusion of the false lumen down to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">celiac</z:e> artery, and 5 patients had a patent false lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients required further replacement of the thoracoabdominal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In non-Marfan patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, the false lumen distal to the graft anastomosis was likely to be thrombosed when the graft was anastomosed to the true lumen only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postoperative visceral circulation was not compromised, but <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752130" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord ischemia</z:e> is a problem that remains to be solved </plain></SENT>
