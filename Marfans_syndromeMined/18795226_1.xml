<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, genetic analyses of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16991">deoxyribonucleic acid</z:chebi> (DNA) from approximately 10-30% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients who meet diagnostic criteria do not reveal an identifiable FBN1 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a patient who met the diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, bidirectional DNA sequencing of exons and intron-exon boundaries of FBN1 failed to reveal a mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Assessment of the FBN1 message in dermal fibroblasts from the patient revealed insertion of a pseudoexon between exons 63 and 64 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of intron 63 identified a point mutation, IVS63+373, located near the middle of intron 63 of FBN1 that created a donor splice site in intron 63, leading to inclusion of a 93-bp fragment of intronic sequence in the FBN1 message </plain></SENT>
