<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the recessive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086795" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hurler's disease</z:e>, the storage of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycan</z:chebi> (GAG) is due to impaired degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examines the kinetics of GAG accumulation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's disease</z:e> in order to determine whether the mechanism of accumulation differs from that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086795" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hurler's disease</z:e>.Marfan-derived fibroblasts incorporated [(14)C]<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> or [(14)C]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">glucosamine</z:chebi> into GAG to a level 4-6 times greater than control fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sugar analyses, electrophoretic mobility, and enzyme susceptibility studies showed that the isolated material was <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16336">hyaluronic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in activity of a variety of glycosidases between Marfan and control fibroblasts, nor were there differences in the ability to degrade prelabeled hyaluronate by cell-free extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, chase experiments showed parallel rates of loss of labeled GAG from control fibroblasts and fibroblasts from Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It appears that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16336">hyaluronic acid</z:chebi> was accumulating in greater amounts in the fibroblasts from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's disease</z:e> because of a greater rate of synthesis as opposed to a decreased rate of breakdown </plain></SENT>
