<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LDS is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> or dissections of the aorta similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005116'>arterial tortuosity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in the peripheral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial diseases</z:e> of LDS to differentiate it from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 10 LDS patients with an identified mutation in TGFBR (6 male, 4 female; mean age 36.3 years) and 20 MFS patients with an identified mutation in fibrilin-1 who were age- and sex-matched to the LDS subjects (12 male, 8 female; mean age 37.1 years) were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of vertebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0005116'>arterial tortuosity</z:hpo> (VAT) and peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="59" ids="53571">PAN</z:chebi>) was studied using computed tomography angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 9 of the 10 LDS patients had VAT, and five <z:chebi fb="59" ids="53571">PANs</z:chebi> were observed in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 8 (40%) of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients had VAT, and 1 patient had a <z:chebi fb="59" ids="53571">PAN</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LDS had a higher prevalence of VAT (P = 0.017) by Fisher's exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The VAT was highly prevalent among LDS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, the presence of VAT has the potential to differentiate LDS from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
