<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>WSS in the thoracic aorta was quantified based on time-resolved 3D phase contrast MRI with three-directional velocity encoding (4D flow MRI, temporal resolution ∼44 ms, spatial resolution ∼2.5 mm) in 24 patients with confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> (age = 18 ± 12 years) and in 12 older healthy volunteers (age = 25 ± 3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diameters of the thoracic aorta normalized to body surface area were similar for both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peak systolic velocity, absolute WSS, time-averaged WSS, circumferential WSS, peak systolic WSS, and WSS eccentricity were calculated in eight analysis planes distributed along the thoracic aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plane-wise comparison revealed significant differences between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients and volunteers in the proximal ascending aorta for peak systolic velocities (1.11 ± 0.23 m/s vs. 1.34 ± 0.18 m/s, P = 0.004) and circumferential WSS (0.14 ± 0.03 N/m(2) vs. 0.11 ± 0.02 N/m(2) , P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>WSS eccentricity was altered in most of the ascending aorta and proximal arch (P = 0.009-0.020) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients demonstrated segmental differences in peak systolic WSS with a significantly higher WSS at the inner curvature in the proximal ascending aorta and at the anterior part in the more distal ascending aorta (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate differences in WSS associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> despite similar aortic dimensions compared to controls </plain></SENT>
