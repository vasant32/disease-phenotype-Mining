<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine, on the basis of the late fate of the intact aortic arch with abnormal tissue after aortic root replacement, whether the intact aortic arch should be replaced prophylactically at the time of aortic root replacement for annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was performed in 85 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who underwent aortic root replacement for annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (mean age 37 years, range 19-61 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These 85 patients were divided into four groups according to the postoperative condition of the residual aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In group I (n = 47), the patients underwent aortic root replacement for annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> with or without localized dissection in the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these patients the residual aorta, including the aortic arch, was therefore intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In group II (n = 10), the aortic arch was intact, although the descending thoracic aorta was dissected because of the preoperative type B dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In groups III and IV, the patients had type A dissection involving the transverse arch associated with annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In group III (n = 13), residual dissection existed in the descending thoracic aorta after concomitant total arch replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In group IV (n = 15), the aortic arch and the descending thoracic aorta were dissected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 5 early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (3 in group I, 1 in group II, and 1 in group III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subsequent operations were required in 10, 5, 6, and 7 cases in groups I, II, III, and IV, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Regarding the aortic arch, only 2 of 53 survivors of the initial hospitalization with an intact aortic arch (groups I and II) underwent subsequent total arch replacement for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of dissection in the aortic arch, and 4 of 14 survivors of the initial hospitalization with a residual dissecting arch (group III) needed subsequent total arch replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Actuarial freedom from arch repair among patients with an intact aortic arch (91% at 15 years) was significantly higher than that among patients with a residual dissecting arch (49% at 15 years, P =.0078) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of new dissection in the residual intact arch after aortic root replacement was extremely low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore prophylactic replacement of the intact arch does not appear to be necessary at aortic root replacement for annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
