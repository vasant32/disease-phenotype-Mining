<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> characteristically have an asthenic body habitus and are considered to be exempt from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> epidemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence and clinical impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in a cohort of adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty outpatients (30 female) with a mean (+/- SD) age of 38+/-13 years were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic variables including previously identified risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Body mass index (BMI) was determined and patients were classified as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (BMI less than 25 kgm2), overweight (BMI 25 kgm2 to 29.9 kgm2) or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (BMI 30 kgm2 or greater) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An adverse clinical outcome was defined as either the attainment of surgical criteria for aortic root replacement or the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> was present in 13 (26%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 23 (46%) patients, there was no known family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean BMI was 25.4+/-7.4 kgm2, with 18 (36%) patients having an elevated BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Positive smoking status was present in 15 (30%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in 13 (26%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> in 19 (38%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Adverse clinical outcome was present in 27 (54%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis revealed only index case (OR 44; P&lt;0.001) and higher BMI (OR 1.2; P=0.04) to be significantly and independently associated with increased risk of adverse clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> is common in adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and is associated with an increased risk of aortic complications </plain></SENT>
