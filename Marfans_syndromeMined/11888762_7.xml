<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic dissection</z:hpo> is a potentially life-threatening condition and may follow surgical interventions as a complication with distinct presentation and high mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Information on the incidence and etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> following cardiac surgery is sparse and inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The true incidence of this entity may so far have been underestimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data of 223 operations on the thoracic aorta performed exclusively at our institution between January 1990 and May 2001 were analysed for clinical and prognostic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and traumatic cases were not included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases of type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> following cardiac surgery were investigated further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dissection of the ascending aorta occurred in 83 patients, of whom 11 (13.2%, six <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and five <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>) had undergone previous cardiac surgery (four aortic valve replacements (AVR), two double valve replacements (DVR), two AVR+coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG), three CABGs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The time interval between first operation and dissection was 0.2-17 years (median 3.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight (72%) patients had arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The aortic diameter was &gt;or=50mm in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 11 cases upon presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Dissections were treated with Bentall procedures (3), Cabrol procedure (1), supracoronary tube graft (6) including concomitant CABG (3) and AVR with local repair (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Total in-hospital mortality was 54% (6/11), and 66% (4/6) in cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection due to low cardiac output (3) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Type-A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> can follow cardiac operations at any time with no typical interval or associated histology and with high overall hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Male patients with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> are at increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Clinical presentation may differ from primary dissection with implications for management and risk estimation </plain></SENT>
