<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One form of EMT is endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the expression profile of the HMGA2 gene in different human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aortic specimens were collected from 51 patients, including 19 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, 26 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo>, two with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and four aortic valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was carried out for HMGA2 and immunohistochemical analyses were performed for HMGA2, SNAI1, Vimentin, CD34, MKI-67 and TGFB1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of let-7d microRNA, which is assumed to play a role in the regulation of HMGA2, was also quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The level of HMGA2 gene expression was significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the other samples (193.1 vs. 8.1 fold normalized to calibrator, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemical investigation showed that HMGA2, SNAI1, and Vimentin proteins were mainly detected in the endothelial cells of the vasa vasorum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The HMGA2 gene is upregulated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is the first report describing a link between HMGA2 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The HMGA2, SNAI1 and Vimentin proteins were mainly detected in the endothelium of the vasa vasorum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It seems that HMGA2 overexpression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> occurs in a let-7d-independent manner and is associated with EndMT of the vasa vasorum </plain></SENT>
