<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study describes symmetry of <z:mp ids='MP_0003099'>retinal tears</z:mp> and bilateral RD surgery in five MS patients over a period of 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six eyes with uncomplicated RD were operated on using the scleral buckling procedure, and four eyes with complicated RD were operated using a pars plana vitrectomy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) and inner <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> tamponade with silicon oil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> reattachment was achieved in seven eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Partial anatomical success with attached macula was achieved in <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The surgery failed in two eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Final visual acuity was between 0.66 and 0.33 in three eyes, and between 0.25 and 0.1 in five; two eyes had no light perception </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The course of the bilateral <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> disease highly correlated with the symmetry of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> defects </plain></SENT>
