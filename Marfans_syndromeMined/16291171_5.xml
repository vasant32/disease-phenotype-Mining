<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, a minimally invasive surgical repair of PE that requires sternal bar placement has become increasingly frequent to enhance patients' cardiopulmonary functioning as well as their self-esteem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, despite this innovative technique, it is possible for such patients to have a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> while their sternal bar is in place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whether the presence of a metal bar on the underside of their sternum may hinder resuscitative chest compressions (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) is an issue that concerns us, our patients, and their families; the answer requires further investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We present a 21-year-old man with PE who underwent a minimally invasive pectus repair but had a fatal cardiac event before bar removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Paramedics conducting cardiopulmonary resuscitation on the patient later reported that they were unable to deliver effective cardiac compressions and that the sternal bar may have contributed to this </plain></SENT>
