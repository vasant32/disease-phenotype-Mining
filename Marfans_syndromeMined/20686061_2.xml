<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is a potentially fatal disorder with cardiovascular, skeletal, and other manifestations that may also be seen in individuals without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, making diagnosis difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our goals were (1) to examine the ways in which patients have been recognized as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, (2) to examine the prevalence of current diagnostic findings, and (3) to determine which physically evident features are most sensitive and specific for referral to confirm a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 2005 and 2007, we prospectively studied 183 consecutive patients with identified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (Marfan group) and 1257 orthopaedic patients and family members (non-Marfan group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the Marfan group, we recorded age at the time of recognition and the methods by which the syndrome was recognized; we used Ghent criteria to identify physically and radiographically evident features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the non-Marfan group, we examined for Ghent criteria that could be noted on the basis of a routine history, physical examination, or radiographs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used means, odds ratios, and frequencies to analyze the diagnostic use of each finding (alpha = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to the Ghent criteria, 27% of patients in the Marfan group (mean age at the time of diagnosis, 7.3 years) had major skeletal involvement whereas 19% had zero or one skeletal feature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common physical features were craniofacial characteristics, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000156'>high-arched palate</z:hpo>, positive thumb and wrist signs, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the non-Marfan group, 83% had one skeletal feature, 13% had two skeletal features, and 4% had three skeletal features or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The physical features with the highest diagnostic yield were craniofacial characteristics, thumb and wrist signs, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo>, and severe hindfoot valgus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Musculoskeletal clinicians should be aware of the diagnostic features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with three to four physically evident features, or two highly specific features (e.g., thumb and wrist signs, craniofacial features, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo>, or protrusio), should be carefully reexamined and possibly referred for an echocardiogram or a genetics consultation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic Level II </plain></SENT>
