<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the last 21 years, 55 patients with type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> underwent 65 operations including 10 reoperations, and 10 cases showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As circulatory support during operation, venoarterial bypass mainly was used until March 1987 (period I) and low-dose heparinized left heart bypass was applied since April 1987 (period II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgical results were compared among subgroups by the Kaplan-Meier actuarial method and Cox-Mantel statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the operation, early mortality was 27.3% in 33 patients in period I and 9.4% in 32 patients in period II (p = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic complications was decreased significantly by using the left heart bypass technique (p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 5-year actuarial survival of type B dissection was 60.6% in period I and 79.2% in period II (p = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that surgical results of type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in this series might be improved with the introduction of left heart bypass and extended surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
