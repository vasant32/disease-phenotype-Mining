<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The long-term implications of failed aortic surveillance leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection and emergency repair are poorly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the long-term clinical courses of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who survive emergency versus elective proximal aortic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Genetically Triggered Thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>Aortic Aneurysms</z:hpo> and Cardiovascular Conditions Registry is a National Institutes of Health-funded multicenter database and biorepository that enrolls patients with genetically triggered thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 635 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> enrolled as of March 2011, 194 had undergone proximal aortic replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were grouped according to emergency (n = 47) or elective (n = 147) status at the time of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients in the emergency group were more likely to have incomplete proximal aortic resection; 83% of emergency procedures included aortic root replacement, compared with 95% of elective procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At long-term follow-up (mean, &gt;6 years), the emergency group had a higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection of the distal aorta and significantly larger diameters in distal aortic segments than elective patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients in the emergency group had undergone more operations (1.31 vs 1.11 procedures/patient; P = .01) and had lower activity scores on a health-related quality of life survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, failed aortic surveillance and consequent emergency dissection repair have important long-term implications with regard to the status of the distal aorta, need for multiple procedures, and quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings emphasize the importance of aortic surveillance and timely elective aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> repair for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
