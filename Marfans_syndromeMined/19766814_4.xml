<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Late survival and freedom from retreatment on the descending aorta was evaluated after ascending aortic repair for type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (TAAAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between March 1992 and January 2006, 189 TAAAD patients (mean age, 52 +/- 11; range, 17 to 83 years) were included; of these, 58 had a patent false lumen, and 49 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The descending aorta was evaluated postoperatively with computed tomography (CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Late outcomes were assessed by Cox regression analysis and actuarial survival and freedom from retreatment by the Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 88 +/- 44 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 38 (20%) late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 10 years, survival was 89.8% +/- 2.1% for patients with an occluded false lumen and 59.8% +/- 3.5% for patients with a patent false lumen (p = 0.001), and freedom from retreatment on the descending aorta was 94.2% +/- 3.1% for an occluded false lumen and 63.7% +/- 2.6% for a patent false lumen (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Descending <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003496" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic rupture</z:e> (p = 0.002) and a patent false lumen (p = 0.001) were predictors for late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patent false lumen (p = 0.0001), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (p = 0.03), and descending aortic diameter 4.5 cm or larger (p = 0.002) were predictors for retreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A patent false lumen was a predictor for late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and retreatment on the descending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and aortic size exceeding 4.5 cm were predictors for late retreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These patients require very close follow-up and a plan for retreatment on the descending aorta to prevent sudden rupture and late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
