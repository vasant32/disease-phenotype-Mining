<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent US and European registries have indicated 30% to 60% of patients with critical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>valvular aortic stenosis</z:hpo> (AS) are not treated surgically, usually due to advanced age and comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on a Food and Drug Administration approved feasibility study of a less invasive transcatheter approach to potentially treat these high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between December 2006 and February 18, 2008, 40 patients underwent transcatheter insertion of a balloon expandable stainless-steel stent with an internally mounted three-leaflet equine pericardial valve (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Edwards</z:e> Sapien Transcatheter Heart Valve; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Edwards</z:e> Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) into the aortic annulus using a transapical left ventricular insertion (TA-AVI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were inoperable by conventional surgery, or extremely high risk based on Society of Thoracic Surgeons score greater than 15% or other documented risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 40 valves were successfully delivered and 35 were successfully seated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two valves embolized and required <z:mp ids='MP_0010610'>open aortic valve</z:mp> replacement (AVR), and one case of severe regurgitation later required AVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a further two patients placed on cardiopulmonary support, one valve later embolized and one migrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 7 (17.5%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> within 30 days, and a further 2 (5%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> before discharge at 42 and 72 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no immediate postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> after successful deployment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Valve area improved from 0.62 cm(2) (SD of 0.13) to 1.61 cm(2) (SD 0.37) at 30 days (p = or&lt;0.0001), with mean perivalvular regurgitation of 1.19 (SD 0.80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 143 days (SD 166 days) with 6 further <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from comorbid disease, none valve or cardiac related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier survival was 81.8% +/- 6.2% at 1 month and 71.7% +/- 7.7% at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transapical insertion of a balloon expandable stented valve is feasible but carries considerable risk and will be further evaluated in the PARTNER (Placement of AoRTic traNscathetER valve) randomized trial </plain></SENT>
