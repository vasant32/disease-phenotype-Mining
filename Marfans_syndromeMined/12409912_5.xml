<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirteen LLDs of 2 cm or more were recorded from a group of 250 Marfan patients visiting a medical genetics clinic for complete care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was confirmed by standing anteroposterior pelvic radiograph and/or scanogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Records and anteroposterior radiographs of the spine were reviewed to obtain Cobb angles for spinal curvatures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A mean discrepancy of 3.2 +/- 1.0 cm and a Cobb angle of 37.0 degrees +/- 28.4 degrees were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve of 13 curves were convex toward the shorter leg, caudally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> greater than 10 degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five curves were severe and progressive, suggesting the need for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>spinal fusion</z:hpo> and prior equalization of leg lengths </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LLD correlated weakly with Cobb angle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LLD is more common in individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> than in the general population and is associated with increased structural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
