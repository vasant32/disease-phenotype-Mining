<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have found a new biological function of interferons, namely, their capacity to protect human cells from the action of some physical and chemical <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the protective effect of interferons the following criteria were applied: formation of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) and chromosomal aberrations (CA), as well as viability of cells and intensity of DNA repair synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of cells with natural interferon decreased the number of sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations, induced by different <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagens</z:chebi>, and increased the intensity of DNA repair synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is attributed to the ability of interferon to enhance certain phases of DNA repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the case of photomutagenic action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18358">8-methoxypsoralen</z:chebi> (8-MOP) on the lymphocytes, when monoadducts (MA) only, or both monoadducts and interstrand cross-links (ICL) are formed, the antimutagenic effect of interferon is exhibited only with respect to ICL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unlike the natural interferon, the recombinant alpha 2-interferon failed to have any effect on the lymphocytes of clinically healthy donors exposed to gamma-radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the repair- deficient cells (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>) the protection of natural interferon against the action of 4-nitroquinoline-1'-<z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and gamma- radiation was found to be reduced significantly and that of alpha 2-interferon was not manifested at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the capacity of interferons to alter the DNA repair, conceivably, depends on the type of interferon and on the cell genotype </plain></SENT>
