<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We consider operative survival as the primary objective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection and believe that virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> native aortic valves can be conserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to answer the question: "Does glue repair improve the long-term stability of proximal aortic repair?" METHODS: We retrospectively studied 64 patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection, an ascending aortic tear, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> operated on by the same surgeon between 1988 and 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and 2 had a bicuspid valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The valves in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> were repaired with gelatin-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="27810">resorcinol</z:chebi>-formol glue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The valve and root were reinvestigated by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some patients underwent nuclear magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were four hospital (6%) and three late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aortic root reoperation was required in 2 of the 60 survivors (3.3%) and operation on the distal aorta in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Root reoperations were required within 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The remaining proximal repairs remained stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The native aortic valve can be conserved in most patients, and glue repair is durable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Simple root repair is associated with a low operative mortality </plain></SENT>
