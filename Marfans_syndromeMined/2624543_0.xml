<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to evaluate if characteristic features of Dupuytren aponeurosis are in some way influenced by alterations in collagenic and elastic bundles present in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>So we compared histological, enzymatic and immunochemical features of tissue fragments from Marfan with similar fragments from simple Dupuytren patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed a substantial difference in the predominant type of collagen which is adult type I in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Dupuytren disease and fetal type III in Marfan patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Collagenic bundles are more dispersed in Marfan, and the whole aponeurosis seems less compact and resistant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No difference was observed in cellular populations of aponeurosis, and also myofibroblasts are present with abundant myosin ATPase activity both in Marfan with Dupuytren both in Dupuytren alone </plain></SENT>
