<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These procedures were conducted to eliminate the possibility of transmission of the affected allele from the father to his offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mutation on chromosome 15 is transmitted as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> trait, and the chance of having a child affected with the disease is 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A couple presented to the Program for In Vitro Fertilization, Reproductive Surgery and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>Infertility</z:hpo> for preimplantation genetic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IVF was performed and embryo biopsy was done on day 3 embryos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Single blastomeres were removed from embryos and subjected to nested PCR analysis and endonuclease digestion to detect a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> mutation located on chromosome 15 inherited from the father </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen oocytes were injected with spermatozoa using intracytoplasmic sperm injection, and nine fertilized normally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following embryo biopsy and polymerase chain reaction amplification-Ddel endonuclease digestion, five embryos were detected that were positive for the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The four non-affected embryos were transferred to the uterus, resulting in a healthy and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ongoing pregnancy </plain></SENT>
