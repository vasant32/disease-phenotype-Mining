<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular complications, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> and dissection drastically reduce life expectancy of individuals with MfS, whereas preventive surgery substantially improves the prognosis of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A number of mutations in the fibrillin 1 (FBN1) gene associated with MfS have been identified to date, demonstrating considerable molecular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One region, however, located around exon 24, exhibits a striking clustering of mutations, which are associated with a severe, socalled neonatal form of MfS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we report the first mutation (G2950A) in exon 24 of the neonatal region of the FBN1 gene, associated with a classic MfS phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mutation leads to the subsitution of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="27266">valin</z:chebi> by isoleucin (V984I), both uncharged amino acids, which only differ in a single <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32875">methyl group</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This defect was identified in a proband with cardiovascular manifestations of MfS by SSCP analysis of PCR-amplified genomic DNA, direct PCR sequencing and RFLP analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The substitution was neither detected in the unaffected 4-year old daughter of the proband, nor in 3 of his healthy family members nor in 108 allels from control individuals, suggesting that this mutation is causative for MfS in the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since no other family member of the proband is affected by MfS, the defect described is <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, we identified a novel defect in exon 24 of the neonatal region of the FBN1 gene in a patient with a classic phenotype of MfS, suggesting that conservative substitutions in this region may lead to a less severe phenotype of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This finding further demonstrates the remarkable phenotypic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> associated with FBN1 mutations and stresses the significance of modifying genes and individual alterations in protein function for the pheontypic expression of the disease </plain></SENT>
