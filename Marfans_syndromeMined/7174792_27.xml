<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Aortae from three patients with classic presentation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, who died of vascular complications, were subjected to biochemical analyses of the connective tissue; for comparison, aortae from eight age-matched controls, without evidence of connective tissue abnormalities, were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elastin was prepared from the aortae by two techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First, the tissues were extracted with 5 M <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42820">guanidine</z:chebi>-HCl, <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> collagenase digestion and reduction with dithiothreitol (elastin I preparation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondly, this material was further purified by extraction with 0.1 M <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32145">NaOH</z:chebi> at 99 degrees C (elastin II preparation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Amino acid analyses of both elastin preparations indicated that the values for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37628">desmosine</z:chebi> and isodesmosine were reduced in Marfan cases to approximately one-half of the control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A corresponding increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32568">lysyl</z:chebi> residues was noted in elastin II preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, the concentration of elastin per milligram dry weight of tissue was reduced in Marfan cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18095">hydroxyproline</z:chebi> content of elastin was increased in two cases with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recoveries indicated that the alkali treatment solubilized 46.2% of the elastin I preparations in Marfan aortae compared with 23.7% in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast to elastin, the concentration and solubility of collagen were unchanged; the amino acid composition and the genetic types of insoluble collagen isolated by limited pepsin proteolysis were the same in both Marfan and control aortae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of our study demonstrate that the cross-linking of aortic elastin is reduced in the three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, a defect in elastin could explain the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular fragility</z:e> observed clinically in these patients </plain></SENT>
