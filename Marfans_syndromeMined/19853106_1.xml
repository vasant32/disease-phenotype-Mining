<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The low incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> among children and young adults limits information about etiology, surgical indications, procedures of choice, and operative results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 2003 to 2008, 35 patients aged 7 to 35 years (mean 21) underwent replacement of the ascending aorta for 19 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and 16 aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Underlying diseases included 10 congenital aortic stenoses, 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valves</z:hpo>, 8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart diseases</z:hpo>, 6 Marfan syndromes, and 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Indications for surgery were maximal diameter of 200% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> for isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and 160% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in case of associated aortic valve dysfunction or symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Operative procedures included 27 ascending aortic replacements with or without aortic valve replacement (including 22 conduits) and 8 valve-sparing operations, performed in 6 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and 2 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was 1 in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients survived the operation and are in New York Heart Association functional class II or less at a maximum of 5 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients are free from reoperation, but 1 patient had a thromboembolic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aortic valve function is good in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 8 patients after the valve-sparing operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>Ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> in children and young adults was surgically treated with excellent midterm outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A diameter of 200% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> was the indication for surgery; however, in case of associated lesions, smaller diameters should be considered for surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conduit implantation is the gold standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Valve-sparing operation can be performed in selected patients with encouraging results </plain></SENT>
