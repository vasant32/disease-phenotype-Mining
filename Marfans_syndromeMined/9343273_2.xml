<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to elucidate demographic and nosologic characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (MS) and other systemic disorders associated with congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> (ECL) in Denmark, a register of affected persons was established in a nationwide retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three hundred and forty patients with MS (180M, 160F) were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By January 1, 1993, the estimated prevalence rate of MS was 4.6/100,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An estimated average birth rate of 0.96/10,000 live born was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was decreased (38 +/- 18 y) mainly due to cardiovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, a median cumulative probability of survival of 57 y (males) and 58 y (females) was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only seven patients with ECL as manifestation of other systemic disorders were diagnosed in the material, i.e. three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo>, two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265313" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Weill-Marchesani syndrome</z:e>, and another 2 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="17359">sulphite</z:chebi> oxidase deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a further 122 cases with ECL a nosologic diagnosis could not be established due to unavailable or insufficient information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This group may comprise patients with MS and other systemic disorders as well as patients with non-systemic ECL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In retrospect, the differential diagnostic activity for patients with congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> has been insufficient during the last few decades and a common protocol for diagnosis, control and treatment of ECL is needed </plain></SENT>
