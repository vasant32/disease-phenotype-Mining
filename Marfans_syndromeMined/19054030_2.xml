<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to detect any alterations in CC using the vascular image analysis system (VIA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients, 20 men and 12 women (mean age 34.2 +/- 12.05 years), and 29 controls matched for age, sex, and body surface area (BSA) were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The entire length of each carotid system was initially scanned longitudinally using a 14 MHz linear transducer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then, a stereotactic clamp held the transducer in contact with the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arterial diameter changes during the cardiac cycle were recorded for 1 minute from both right (RCCA) and left common carotid arteries (LCCA) separately using the VIA system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RCCA and LCCA compliance and distensibility measurements were significantly reduced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients when compared to controls, P &lt; 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RCCA and LCCA intima-media thickness did not differ between patients and controls, P &gt; 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> diagnosis and age were associated with reduced CC in both carotid arteries after adjusting for variables such as, sex, BSA, heart rate, beta-blockade, intima-media thickness, and aortic root size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed a reduction in CC in adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This could be attributed to fibrillin-1 deficiency resulting in structural abnormalities in the carotid arterial wall </plain></SENT>
