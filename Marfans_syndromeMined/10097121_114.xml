<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is yet to be established whether dysfunction of fibrillin-1 perturbs the ability of the elastic vessel wall to sustain hemodynamic stress by disrupting microfibrillar assembly, by impairing the homeostasis of established elastic fibers, or by a combination of both mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathogenic sequence responsible for the mechanical collapse of the elastic lamellae in the aortic wall is also unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Targeted mutation of the mouse fibrillin-1 gene has recently suggested that deficiency of fibrillin-1 reduces tissue homeostasis rather than elastic fiber formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we describe another gene-targeting mutation, mgR, which shows that underexpression of fibrillin-1 similarly leads to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>-like manifestations </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More generally, the phenotypic severity associated with various combinations of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and mutant fibrillin-1 alleles suggests a threshold phenomenon for the functional collapse of the vessel wall that is based on the level and the integrity of microfibrils </plain></SENT>
