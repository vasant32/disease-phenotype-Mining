<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: For the majority of cases, the cause of spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and rupture is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An inherited risk is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268338" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="EDS4">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV</z:e>, and loci mapped to diverse autosomal chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of pedigrees however has indicated that it may be also inherited as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> trait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The biglycan gene, found on chromosome X in humans and mice, encodes a small leucine-rich <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> involved in the integrity of the extracellular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A vascular phenotype has never been described in mice deficient in the gene for small leucine-rich <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the breeding of BALB/cA mice homozygous for a null mutation of the biglycan gene, we observed that 50% of biglycan-deficient male mice died suddenly within the first 3 months of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Necropsies revealed a major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in the thoracic or abdominal cavity, and histology showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003496" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic rupture</z:e> that involved an intimal and medial tear as well as dissection between the media and adventitia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By transmission electron microscopy and biomechanical testing, the aortas of biglycan-deficient mice showed structural abnormalities of collagen fibrils and reduced tensile strength </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar collagen fibril changes were observed in male as well as in female biglycan-deficient mice, which implies a role of additional determinants such as gender-related response to stress in the development of this vascular catastrophe only in male mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of biglycan-deficient male mice from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003496" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic rupture</z:e> implicates biglycan as essential for the structural and functional integrity of the aortic wall and suggests a potential role of biglycan gene defects in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and rupture in humans </plain></SENT>
