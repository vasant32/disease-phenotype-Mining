<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Marfan associated mutations in the FBN1 gene lead to increased transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the role of plasma TGF-β as a biomarker for progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> and dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma TGF-β level and aortic root diameter by means of echocardiography were assessed in 99 MFS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 38months of follow-up measurement of the aortic root was repeated and individual aortic root growth curves were constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical events were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary composite endpoint was defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and prophylactic aortic root replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TGF-β levels were higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients as compared to healthy controls (109pg/ml versus 54pg/ml, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Higher plasma TGF-β levels correlated with larger aortic root dimensions (r=0.26, p=0.027), previous aortic root surgery (161pg/ml versus 88pg/ml, p=0.007) and faster aortic root growth rate (r=0.42, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During 38months of follow-up, 17 events were observed (four type B dissections and 13 aortic root replacements) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with TGF-β levels above 140pg/ml had a 6.5 times higher risk of experiencing the composite endpoint compared to patients with TGF-β levels below 140pg/ml (95% CI: 2.1 to 20.1, p=0.001) with 65% sensitivity and 78% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Elevated TGF-β level in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is correlated with larger aortic root diameters and faster aortic root growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Level of plasma TGF-β predicts cardiovascular events and might serve as a prognostic biomarker in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
