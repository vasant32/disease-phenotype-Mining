<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The present study examines the incidence of aortic complications (dissection, marked dilation requiring surgery or progressive moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>) and their relation to clinical features and aortic root <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Considerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>phenotypic variability</z:hpo> exists in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and the prospective prediction of the risk for aortic complications in individual patients remains elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred thirteen patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> underwent anthropometric and echocardiographic evaluation and were followed-up for 49 +/- 24 (mean +/- SD) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aortic root dilation was defined as localized when confined to the sinuses of Valsalva (based on two-dimensional echocardiographic confidence limits utilizing age and body size) and generalized if dilation additionally involved the supraaortic ridge and proximal ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Aortic root dilation was present in 80% of patients and was localized in 28% and generalized in 51% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aortic complications occurred during follow-up in none of 23 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> initial aortic size, in 2 (6%) of 32 patients with initially localized dilation and in 19 (33%) of 58 patients with generalized dilation (p &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complications were associated with larger initial aortic size (p &lt; 0.00005), higher systolic blood pressure (p &lt; 0.005), height (p &lt; 0.05), aortic growth rate (p &lt; 0.05) and older age (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The only independent predictor of aortic complications was initial aortic root size (p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, when aortic size, one of the indications for surgical referral, was excluded from analyses, the only independent predictor of aortic complications was generalized <z:mp ids='MP_0010574'>aortic dilation</z:mp> (p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that generalized aortic root dilation is a potent marker of an increased risk for subsequent aortic complications in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
