<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, diagnostic reliability of a series of clinical signs indicative of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) hypermobility was tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study sample consisted of 42 subjects with GJH, 24 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and 18 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A subgroup of 27 individuals was selected by age (&gt; or = 18 yrs) and was compared to 40 controls with TMD and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral joint mobility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TMD diagnoses were assigned to each subject according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039494" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Temporomandibular Disorders</z:e> (RDC/TMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the GJH sample (n = 42), 71.4% of the subjects were symptomatic for TMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of those, 13.3% had sought treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0553642" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myofascial pain</z:e> diagnosis was made in 69%, disc dislocation with reduction was diagnosed in 85.7%, and TMJ <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo> in 61.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple TMD diagnoses were assigned in 69% of the subjects; of these, 57% had 3 or more subgroup diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Joint noises (P &lt; .01) and recurrent TMJ <z:hpo ids='HP_0001373'>dislocations</z:hpo> (P &lt; .01) were a frequent finding in adult GJH subjects (n = 27) compared to controls, with symptomatic GJH subjects presenting more and more prolonged dislocation events than asymptomatic subjects (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TMJ hypermobility signs were expressed significantly more often in GJH compared to controls with TMD and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> joint mobility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study indicates a positive relationship between GJH and TMD </plain></SENT>
