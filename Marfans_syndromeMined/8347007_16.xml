<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between 1977 and 1991, 876 operations were performed on the thoracic aorta in our institution: 340 in dissections, 299 in true <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, 150 for aortic remodeling and external wall support during aortic valve replacement, and 87 for miscellaneous causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the same period, there were 193 additional reoperations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vascular reoperations on abdominal aorta and peripheral arteries accounted for 73 cases and are not further discussed in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reasons for reoperation (n = 130) in 120 patients were: failure of biologic valves (n = 23); <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> recurrence in a proximal or distal aortic segment (n = 21); pseudoaneurysm formation at suture lines (n = 13); new dissection or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> involving ascending aorta (n = 11), aortic arch (n = 13), and descending aorta (n = 10); <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> after aortic remodeling (n = 13); new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of valvular disease (n = 5); and new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Infected aortic graft and prosthetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> accounted for 10 reoperations, and a planned two-staged procedure was performed in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Omitting the failed biologic valves, reoperations were performed on the aortic segment previously operated on in 69.3% of the cases and on other thoracic segments in 30.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall hospital mortality rate after reoperation was 5.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant decrease in operative mortality was observed in the most recent period (3.0% between 1989 and 1991) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reoperations are technically demanding, and some of them are preventable; therefore (1) graft inclusion technique should be abandoned in ascending aortic operation due to formation of false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>; (2) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, complete repair of the diseased aorta should be attempted during the initial operation; (3) aortic arch dissection should be repaired definitively during the first operation in low-risk patients; (4) biological valves should be avoided in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> operations; and (5) homograft replacement is the treatment of choice in prosthetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> or in infected composite graft after an aortic valve or ascending aortic operation </plain></SENT>
