<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta, arch aorta, or both is surgically challenging and has traditionally carried a high hospital mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The use of refined operative techniques, including improved grafts, enhanced myocardial protection, retrograde cerebral perfusion with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e>, transesophageal echocardiography, and control of hematologic factors, has resulted in reduced hospital mortality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of records of 117 consecutive patients who underwent 118 procedures between March 1987 and September 1997, for graft replacement of the ascending or transverse aortic arch with or without aortic valve reconstruction or replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 67 men (57.3%) and 50 women (42.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 61.4 years (range, 16 to 81 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aortic abnormalities were medial degeneration in 59 patients (50.0%), dissection in 28 patients (23.7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in 16 patients (13.6%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> in 8 patients (6.8%), and other in 7 patients (5.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ascending aorta alone was replaced in 58 patients (49.2%), ascending and arch aorta in 56 patients (47.5%), and isolated arch aorta in 4 patients (3.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients (22.0%) required aortic valve reconstruction, 17 patients (14.4%) had separate aortic valve replacement, and 37 patients (31.4%) received a valve conduit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall hospital mortality rate was 3.4% (4 of 117 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative complications included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> in 3 patients (2.5%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 7 patients (5.9%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0010444'>pulmonary insufficiency</z:hpo> in 22 patients (18.6%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> in 4 patients (3.4%), and reoperation for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in 8 patients (6.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no deep sternal wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was completed for 112 (99.1%) of 113 survivors and ranged from 1 month to 10.6 years (mean, 39.5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival for patients discharged from the hospital was 87.9%+/-3.7% (standard error of the mean) at 3 years and 79.7%+/-5.8% at 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Graft replacement of the ascending and transverse aortic arch, although technically demanding, can be performed with low hospital mortality and morbidity rates </plain></SENT>
