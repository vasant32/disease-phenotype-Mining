<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients present cardiovascular, ocular and skeletal manifestations, and although being fully penetrant, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> is characterized by a wide clinical variability both within and between families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a new mouse model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> that recapitulates the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the syndrome in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Heterozygotes for the mutant Fbn1 allele mgΔloxPneo, carrying the same internal deletion of exons 19-24 as the mgΔ mouse model, present defective microfibrillar deposition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002097'>emphysema</z:hpo>, deterioration of aortic wall and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of a clinical phenotypes is earlier in the 129/Sv than in C57BL/6 background, indicating the existence of genetic modifiers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> between these two mouse strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we characterized a wide clinical variability within the 129/Sv congenic heterozygotes, suggesting involvement of epigenetic factors in disease severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, we show a strong negative correlation between overall levels of Fbn1 expression and the severity of the phenotypes, corroborating the suggested protective role of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fibrillin-1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> pathogenesis, and supporting the development of therapies based on increasing Fbn1 expression </plain></SENT>
