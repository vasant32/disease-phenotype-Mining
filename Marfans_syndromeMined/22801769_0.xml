<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These disorders do not merely result from defects in the amount or structure of one of the components of the extracellular matrix, as the extracellular matrix also serves other functions, including sequestration of cytokines, such as transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indeed, disturbed TGFβ signaling was demonstrated in several heritable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e>, including syndromic forms such as Marfan or Loeys-Dietz syndrome and non-syndromic presentations of thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo>/dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of these findings, new therapeutic targets have been unveiled, leading to the initiation of large clinical trials with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> type 1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> that also have an inhibiting effect on TGFβ signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we present an overview of the clinical characteristics, the molecular findings, and the therapeutic strategies for the currently known syndromic and non-syndromic forms of thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo>/dissection </plain></SENT>
