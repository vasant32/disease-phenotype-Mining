<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although the existence of the young patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> not fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) has been known, the etiology of their disease has not yet been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to elucidate the genetic and clinical features of the young patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> not having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty young adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were divided into a definite <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> (n=51) and a non-definite <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> group (n=29) according to the Ghent nosology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and genetic characteristics were compared between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 29 non-definite <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> probands, 1 (3%) FBN1, 2 (7%) TGFBR1, and 3 (10%) TGFBR2 mutations were found, and 4 ACTA2 mutations were found in the 23 probands examined without FBN1, TGFBR1, or TGFBR2 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In total, more than 10 out of 29 (34%) probands in the non-definite <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> group were associated with genetic mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Skeletal involvement was less frequent in the non-definite than in the definite <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> group (7% vs 82%, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the probands with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic diseases</z:e> in young who cannot be diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, mutations other than FBN1 mutations accounted for at least one-third of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
