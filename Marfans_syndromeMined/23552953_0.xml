<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>When a known microimbalance affecting multiple genes is detected in a patient with syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>intellectual disability</z:hpo>, it is usually presumed causative for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> observed features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whole exome sequencing (WES) allows questioning this assumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study of three families with children affected by unexplained syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>intellectual disability</z:hpo>, genome-wide copy number and subsequent analyses revealed a de novo maternal 1.1 Mb microdeletion in the 14q32 imprinted region causing a paternal UPD(14)-like phenotype, and two inherited 22q11.21 microduplications of 2.5 or 2.8 Mb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patient 1 carrying the 14q32 microdeletion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000098'>tall stature</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000792'>renal malformation</z:hpo> were unexplained by paternal UPD(14), and there was no altered DLK1 expression or unexpected methylation status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By WES and filtering with a mining tool, a novel FBN1 missense variant was found in patient 1 and his mother, who both showed clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> by thorough anthropometric assessment, and a novel EYA1 missense variant as a probable cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000792'>renal malformation</z:hpo> in the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patient 2 with the 22q11.21 microduplication syndrome, skin hypo- and <z:mp ids='MP_0001188'>hyperpigmentation</z:mp> and two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> were only partially explained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By WES, compound heterozygous BLM stop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutations were detected causing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005859" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Bloom syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In male patient 3 carrying a 22q11.21 microduplication inherited from his unaffected father, WES identified a novel missense variant in the OPHN1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>intellectual disability</z:hpo> gene inherited from the unaffected mother as a possible additional cause for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, WES seems warranted in patients carrying microdeletions or microduplications, who have unexplained clinical features or microimbalances inherited from an unaffected parent </plain></SENT>
