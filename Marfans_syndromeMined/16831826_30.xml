<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) is a leading cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in young athletes, and substantial interest persists in strategies for timely identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the diagnostic efficacy of Italian pre-participation screening programme with 12-lead ECG (in addition to history and physical examination) for identification of HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Four thousand four hundred and fifty members of the Italian national teams, initially judged eligible for competition as a result of systematic pre-participation screening across Italy, subsequently underwent clinical and echocardiographic examination at the Institute of Sports Medicine and Science (Rome) to assess the presence of previously undetected HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of the 4450 athletes showed clinical evidence of HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> were detected in only 12 athletes, including <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> (n=4), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> (n=3), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (n=2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> with bicuspid valve (n=2), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, echocardiography identified four athletes with borderline left ventricular wall thickness (i.e. 13 mm) in the 'grey zone' of overlap between HCM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340520" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">athlete's heart</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two of these athletes, subsequent genetic analysis or clinical changes over an average 8-year follow-up resulted, respectively, in a definitive or possible diagnosis of HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Italian national pre-participation screening programme including 12-lead ECG appears to be efficient in identifying young athletes with HCM, leading to their timely disqualification from competitive sports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data also suggest that routine echocardiography is not an obligatory component of broad-based screening programmes designed to identify young athletes with HCM </plain></SENT>
