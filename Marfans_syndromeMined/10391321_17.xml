<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initially only patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aortic valve leaflets had these operations, but more recently we utilized them in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> of a single leaflet and in those with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This article is an update on the clinical results of these operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From May 1988 to December 1997, 126 patients with ascending aorta and/or aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> underwent replacement of the ascending aorta with reconstruction of the aortic root and preservation of the native aortic valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 85 men and 41 women, with a mean age of 54 years (range, 14 to 84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients had the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>; 17 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and 10 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>; 23 had a transverse arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>; 26 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, and 8 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aortic valve sparing operation consisted of simple adjustment of the sinotubular junction in 33 patients, adjustment of the sinotubular junction and replacement of one or more aortic sinuses in 60, and reimplantation of the aortic valve in a tubular Dacron (C.R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bard, Haverhill, PA) graft in 33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients also had repair of aortic leaflet <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 4 patients had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 3 operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed from 2 to 117 months, with a mean of 31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were 11 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>: 7 cardiovascular and 4 from unrelated causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival was 72 +/- 8% at 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Two patients required aortic valve replacement; the freedom from aortic valve replacement was 97 +/- 2% at 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Doppler echocardiography revealed absent, trivial or mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> in most patients; only 9 patients had moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aortic valve sparing operations are feasible in most patients with ascending aorta and/or aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> who have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aortic leaflets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The functional results of the repaired aortic valve are excellent, and the repair appears to be durable </plain></SENT>
