<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The cardiovascular complications of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> arise due to alterations in the structural and functional properties of fibrillin, a constituent of vascular connective tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin-containing microfibrils are closely associated with arterial endothelial cells, indicating a possible functional role for fibrillin in the endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of endothelial cell products are elevated in Marfan subjects, which indirectly indicates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study directly assessed flow- and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>-mediated endothelium-dependent brachial artery reactivity in Marfan subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In 20 Marfan and 20 control subjects, brachial artery diameter, blood flow, and blood pressure were measured by ultrasonic wall tracking, Doppler ultrasound, and photoplethysmography, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Measurements were taken during hand hyperemia (a stimulus for endothelium-derived nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16480">[NO]</z:chebi> release in the upstream brachial artery) and after sublingual administration of the endothelium-independent <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 9 Marfan and 6 control subjects, the above parameters were also assessed during intra-arterial infusions of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> and bradykinin (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> that stimulate NO production) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28229">NG-monomethyl-L-arginine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28229">L-NMMA</z:chebi>, an inhibitor of NO production) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Flow-mediated responses differed markedly between Marfan and control subjects (-1.6+/-3.5% versus 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>50+/-4.1%, respectively; P&lt;0.0001), whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> produced similar vasodilation (14.2+/-5.7% versus 15.2+/-7.8%; P=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">Agonist</z:chebi>-induced vasodilation to incremental intra-arterial infusions of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> and bradykinin were not significantly different between Marfan and control subjects, and intra-arterial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28229">L-NMMA</z:chebi> produced similar reductions in brachial artery diameter in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate impaired flow-mediated but preserved <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilation in Marfan subjects and suggest preservation of basal NO release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Selective loss of flow-mediated dilation suggests a role for fibrillin in endothelial cell mechanotransduction </plain></SENT>
