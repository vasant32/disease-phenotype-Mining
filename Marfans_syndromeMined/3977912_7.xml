<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> is not pyridinoline, since it is a weak fluorophore and its U/V spectrum does not agree with that of pyridinoline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The unknown <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> was isolated and characterized by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and its structure is consistent with a deoxy-analogue of pyridinoline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It may be a crosslink component of some biological importance, since it is not detectable in skin from a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's Syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
