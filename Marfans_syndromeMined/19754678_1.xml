<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The treatment of Stanford type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> involving the arch or associated with proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> remains a surgical challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our results with total arch replacement with the stented elephant trunk (SET) procedure for these complicated Stanford type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between December 2003 and June 2008, 31 patients were admitted for complicated type B dissection (12 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, 19 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age at operation was 44.3 +/- 10.6 years (range: 22-68 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The surgeries were performed by using total arch replacement combined with SET implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Enhanced computed tomography (CT) was performed before discharge as well as 3 months and annually to evaluate the condition of the graft and the residual false lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The procedure was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but two patients; two patients died of multiple organ failure following surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> was observed after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was completed in 27 of 29 patients and the mean follow-up period was 18.4 +/- 12.3 months (range: 6-54 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During follow-up CT scans, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation was observed in the descending aortic false lumen excluded by the stented graft in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient died during follow-up while two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> underwent successful operations for replacement of the remaining descending and abdominal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Total arch replacement with the SET procedure has emerged as a viable option for complicated type B dissections and is associated with low morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At mid-term follow-up, most patients have either thrombosed or have had no further increase in the false lumen of the descending aorta </plain></SENT>
