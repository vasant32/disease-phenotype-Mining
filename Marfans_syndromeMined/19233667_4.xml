<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over the past decade, genetic tests have become available for numerous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heritable disorders</z:e> especially inherited with mendelian models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An important fact is that the results of genetic tests may also be useful beyond the individual affected by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
