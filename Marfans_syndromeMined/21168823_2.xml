<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To describe a novel method for placement of a sulcus-fixated, sutured posterior chamber intraocular lens (sf-SPC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e>) using endoscopic guidance during pars plana vitrectomy surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A retrospective case-series by a single surgeon in both pediatric and adult patients undergoing sf-SPC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e> in the setting of posterior segment surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-four eyes of 71 patients had pars plana vitrectomy and placement of an sf-SPC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e> in an academic, outpatient setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preoperative diagnosis included trauma (42%), subluxated lenses with no capsular support (24%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> (15%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000519'>congenital cataract</z:hpo> (11%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> (6%), and other (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one adults and 20 children (&lt;18 years of age) were reviewed from cases performed from 1999 through 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sf-SPC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e> sutures were placed using endoscopic visualization of ab interno scleral fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was nearly 3 years (3 months to 9 years) and most patients experienced an improvement in visual function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Many eyes had advanced posterior segment disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 2 broken sutures occurred, both attributable to repeat trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Advantages of this technique include: excellent visualization and haptic localization, optimal lens centration, buried knots, broad scleral imbrication, and minimal vitreous- and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Disadvantages include the learning curve, increased operative time, long-term suture stability issues, and limited availability of intraocular endoscopes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic-guided sf-SPC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e> using this approach, in the setting of posterior segment disease, is a reasonable option for visual rehabilitation in both pediatric and adult patients </plain></SENT>
