<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, studies of genetically determined diseases of the connective tissues have yielded a large amount of new information in these areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specific molecular defects can then be correlated with the functional and pathological changes in the tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have concentrated on this approach which takes advantage of the large number of families with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic diseases</z:e> who come to our Hospital from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parts of Australasia and also takes advantage of developments in molecular biology in our Unit which were initiated with a RACS John Mitchell Crouch Fellowship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to these studies on naturally occurring mutations we are also studying specific mutations that we are able to produce in specific regions of the collagen molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another approach takes advantage of a unique model culture system developed in our Unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies will be supplemented by various collaborative projects such as current ones involving smooth muscle cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, bone cells metabolism and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
