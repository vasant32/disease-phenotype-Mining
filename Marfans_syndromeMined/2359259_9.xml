<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Elastin of the ascending aortic media of 10 cases with type A dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, 14 hypertensive cases, and 30 control cases were prepared by the treatment of aortas with hot <z:chebi fb="3" ids="30751">formic acid</z:chebi>, and three-dimensional architecture was observed by scanning electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the control cases, elastin showed framework-like continuous structure consisting of elastic laminae, and interlaminar fibers that interconnected the laminae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 6 of 10 cases of dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, the interlaminar fibers were apparently irregular in arrangement and shape, and decreased in number, especially in the outer media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This architectural alteration resulted in a rarefaction of interconnection between the elastic laminae in the media, and possibly resulted in the local <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> against the dissecting force of the laminae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This medial <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> may be related to the mechanism of initiation and progression of dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMN</z:e>) was found in 3 cases, but only 1 of them was accompanied by a mild decrease of the interlaminar fibers in the area outside of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMN</z:e>, suggesting that the initiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMN</z:e> did not directly relate to the decrease of the interlaminar fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aortic media of hypertensives generally showed an increase of interlaminar fibers, but their focal decrease was encountered in the outer media of 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the decrease of the interlaminar fibers of medial elastin seen in dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
