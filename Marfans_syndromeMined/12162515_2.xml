<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the 23 eyes examined, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>dislocated lens</z:hpo> was related with a hypermature <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> in 4 eyes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in 2 eyes, developed after <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> and Nd:YAG laser iridotomy in 2 eyes, and was due to ocular trauma in 15 eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>dislocated lens</z:hpo> was present for more than a year in 6 eyes and less than 4 weeks in 13 eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>, intravitreal phacofragmentation and scleral fixation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e> were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 23 eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, trabeculectomy was performed in 4 eyes, iridoplasty in 1 eye and cryopexy with intravitreal injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30496">sulfur hexafluoride</z:chebi> in 2 eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Perfluorocarbon liquid was used in 9 eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 11.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On final examination, the visual acuity was better than 20/40 in 17 eyes (73.9%) and counting fingers in 1 eye due to traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> with intravitreal phacofragmentation and other combined procedures is a safe and effective surgical method for treating a completely dislocated crystalline lens </plain></SENT>
