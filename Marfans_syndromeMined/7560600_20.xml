<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We attempted to determine whether a family history of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is associated with increased <z:mp ids='MP_0010574'>aortic dilation</z:mp> or decreased survival, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The prognostic importance of a family history of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> has been incompletely examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that such a family history would correlate with increased <z:mp ids='MP_0010574'>aortic dilation</z:mp> and would be associated with decreased survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred eight affected patients and 48 unaffected family members from 33 multigenerational families with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> underwent echocardiographic measurement of the aortic root, arch and mid-abdominal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Date of birth and age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> ascertained from family pedigrees were used to perform life table analysis and estimate survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Aortic root and arch diameters were significantly greater in patients with a family history of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> than in patients without such a family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of subjects in the highest quartile for aortic size, &gt; 80% had such a family history in contrast to &lt; 10% of those in the lowest quartile (chi-square 57.37, p &lt; 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and cumulative probability of survival were significantly lower in patients with such a family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0010574'>aortic dilation</z:mp> is greater and life expectancy shorter in those with a family history of severe cardiovascular manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that such a family history is an important risk factor for cardiovascular events in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
