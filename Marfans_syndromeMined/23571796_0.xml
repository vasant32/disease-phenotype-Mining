<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a novel one-stage repair that combines primary revascularization of the subclavian with stent coverage of diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 31-year-old woman with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> presented with a growing arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At age 16 years, she had undergone the Ross procedure followed by a redo sternotomy and valve conduit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On follow-up, a distal arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> measuring 6 cm with an aneurysmal upper thoracic aorta and a localized distal thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one stage, triple hybrid off-pump arch debranching with endovascular stent grafting was performed using two GORE Hybrid Vascular Grafts to perform the distal left carotid and subclavian anastomoses, which provided complete primary arch debranching without requiring a carotid-subclavian shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient had no complications, was discharged home on postoperative day 3, and continues to do well 3 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that one-stage repair of complex aortic arch disease with primary revascularization of the subclavian is feasible </plain></SENT>
