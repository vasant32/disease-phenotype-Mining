<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report on a male twin infant who presented with brachy-turri-cephaly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002007'>frontal bossing</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000260'>large anterior fontanelle</z:hpo>, low set and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000377'>malformed ears</z:hpo>, and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> male genitalia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence for maternal virilization during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pattern of malformations resembled <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265307" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Antley-Bixler-Syndrome</z:e> (ABS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, sequencing analysis of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 gene (FGFR2) did not reveal mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The boy's twin sister did not show any somatic or <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the boy, neonatal screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0008258'>congenital adrenal hyperplasia</z:hpo> was positive with moderately elevated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17252">17-hydroxyprogesterone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of his CYP21 gene did not reveal any mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The short synacthen test revealed an exaggerated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17252">17-hydroxyprogesterone</z:chebi> and a blunted <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Urinary steroid profiling by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) revealed a unique steroid metabolome suggestive of impaired activity of both 17-hydroxylase and 21-hydroxylase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinical and metabolic findings therefore were compatible with the recently described variant of <z:hpo ids='HP_0008258'>congenital adrenal hyperplasia</z:hpo>, P450 oxidoreductase deficiency (ORD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, sequencing analysis of CPR, the gene encoding P450 oxidoreductase (OR), revealed a homozygous mutation in the patient, resulting in an amino acid exchange in position 284 of the OR protein (A284P) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Both the female twin sister and the parents were heterozygous for the A284P mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>P450 oxidoreductase deficiency represents a novel autosomal recessively inherited form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0008258'>congenital adrenal hyperplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Its characteristic steroid metabolome can readily be detected by GC-MS analysis of spot urine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Clinical features may include an ABS phenotype, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000062'>ambiguous genitalia</z:hpo> (virilization in girls, feminization in boys), and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>If required, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi> replacement should be provided </plain></SENT>
