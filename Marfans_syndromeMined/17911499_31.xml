<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Patients were administered 8 mg/d of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi> (n = 10) or placebo (n = 7) for 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Indices of arterial stiffness were assessed via systemic arterial compliance, and central and peripheral pulse wave velocities </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">Perindopril</z:chebi> reduced arterial stiffness as indicated by increased systemic arterial compliance (mean [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>], 0.33 [0.01] mL/mm Hg at baseline to 0.54 [0.04] mL/mm Hg at 24 weeks in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi> group vs 0.30 [0.01] mL/mm Hg to 0.29 [0.01] mL/mm Hg in placebo group, P = .004), and reduced central (7.6 [0.4] m/s to 5.9 [0.3] m/s in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi> group, P &lt; .001 vs placebo) and peripheral (10.9 [0.4] m/s to 8.7 [0.4] m/s in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi> group, P &lt; .001 vs placebo) pulse wave velocities </plain></SENT>
