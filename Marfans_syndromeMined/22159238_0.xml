<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aortic root repair included Bentall (n = 37) and valve-sparing (n = 13) procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hospital mortality was 4.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients required 36 repeat surgeries on the distal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main indication for re-intervention was the dilation of the false lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In group A, the distal aorta was stable for up to 7 years, but new dissection developed in 5 (33.3%) of the 15 patients who were followed up for &gt;7 years after the root repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival including operative mortality was 88.1 and 65.0% at 10 and 20 years, respectively; groups A and B did not significantly differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rates of freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, new dissection or repeated aortic surgery were 60.1, 44.5 and 26.0% at 5, 10 and 15 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Group A was significantly better than group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic aortic root repair apparently reduces the likelihood of overall adverse events, but it cannot guarantee the prevention of further <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A multidisciplinary approach is needed for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
