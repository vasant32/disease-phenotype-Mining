<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>If an affected child is born to clinically unaffected parents, it is likely that the child has a de novo mutation, and the risk to sibs is far less than 50% but above the population risk because of reported (but rare) cases of somatic and germline mosaicism </plain></SENT>
