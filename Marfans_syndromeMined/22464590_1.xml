<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Empirical research shows that patients with severe illnesses prefer the physician to dominate decision processes and provide the information needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare diseases</z:e>, due to the low prevalence and the lack of expertise, the patient is forced to become knowledgeable about his own disease state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Objectives of this study were to describe the experiences of patient-physician interaction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare diseases</z:e>, to develop an empirically derived typology of interaction patterns and to explore the antecedents of these interaction patterns, with a special focus on role behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Building on these results, implications for health care policy are made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We designed an exploratory study as a series of semi-standardized interviews with patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We extracted the following six <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare diseases</z:e>: <z:hpo ids='HP_0007354'>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</z:hpo>, Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">epidermolysis bullosa</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> with brain iron accumulation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="WD|WND">Wilson's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 107 interviews were recorded, transcribed and analyzed thematically in accordance with the grounded theory tradition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As suggested, insufficient expertise of the healthcare providers proved to be a major problem in the highly specialized treatment process of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Here, the patient often becomes an expert in his disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we identified the patient-directed interaction as a widely experienced communication pattern among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study also showed that role discrepancies have a major impact on communication processes in this context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: People with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare diseases</z:e> often face challenges, due to the low prevalence and the resulting lack of knowledge of their healthcare providers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Communication processes in this context are mainly affected by the role behavior of both the patient and provider </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The present study showed the relevance of the provider's ability to acknowledge the active role of the patient as an informed, involved and interactive partner in the treatment process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, allowing the patient to control therapy may require a change of mind-set with some long-standing traditional roles in healthcare </plain></SENT>
