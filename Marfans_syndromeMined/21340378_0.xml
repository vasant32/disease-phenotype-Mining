<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From November 2002 to September 2009, 164 consecutive patients with mean age 54 ± 15 years, 115 male, underwent the aortic root reconstruction (125 mechanical valve conduit replacements and 39 valve sparing operations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixteen percent of patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and 4.3% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred and forty-four patients (88%) were followed for a mean period of 41.1 ± 20.8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The hospital mortality was 4.9%, 5.6% in operations with valved conduits and 2.6% in the valve sparing procedures (P &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no difference neither in survival (95% CI = 86% - 96%, P= 0.1) nor in reoperation-free survival (95% CI = 85% - 90%, P = 0.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The survival free of complications such as <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> were favorable to the valve sparing operations, respectively (95% CI = 70% - 95%, P = 0.001), (95% CI = 82% - 95% P = 0.03) and (95% CI = 81% - 95%, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> greater than 1.4 mg/dl, Cabrol operation and renal dialysis were predictors of mortality, respectively, with occurrence chance of 6 (95% CI = 1.8 - 19.5, P = 0.003), 12 (95% CI = 3 - 49.7, P = 0.0004) and 16 (95% CI = 3.6 - 71.3, P = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The aortic root reconstruction has a low early and late mortality, high survival free of complications and low need for reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During the late follow-up, valve sparing aortic root reconstructions presented fewer incidences of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
