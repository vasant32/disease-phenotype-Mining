<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: The outcomes of 14 pregnancies in 4 women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> were prospectively observed between January 1988 and December 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cardiovascular and obstetric complications were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During pregnancy <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients were carefully monitored with serial echocardiography and close attention to symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 14 pregnancies, 5 (35.7%) ended in abortion, and 3 of them occurred in the early second trimester due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007871" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cervical incompetence</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Premature <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of labor occurred in 2 pregnancies at 31 and 34 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011891'>Postpartum hemorrhage</z:hpo> complicated 3 deliveries, and inversion of the uterus occurred in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant cardiovascular complications occurred in 2 patients, who required surgical correction of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> and replacement of the aortic valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In one patient the operation was performed within hours of vaginal delivery, and the other patient underwent surgery 8 weeks postpartum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One infant in the series was diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A premature infant delivered at 31 weeks died on the second day of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> are at high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in pregnancy even in the absence of preconceptional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Obstetric complications in patients with this condition have been underreported in the past </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> of &lt; 40 mm usually tolerate pregnancy well, with good maternal and fetal outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> should be counseled regarding the risk of pregnancy to both mother and fetus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Patients who have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018802" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CHF|chf">cardiac decompensation</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> &gt; 40 mm are advised to avoid pregnancy </plain></SENT>
