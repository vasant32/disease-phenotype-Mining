<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a 1980 review of the natural history and treatment of 176 thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo>, we noted the high incidence of rupture (47% overall) in 135 patients not treated surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since that original study we have added another 84 patients to our series and have noted a complete change in management such that most patients are now treated surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now have 260 patients in our series, 126 of whom were treated surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-seven were emergency operations and 59 were elective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgical mortality was 8% for elective resection and 33% for emergency operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over the past 5 years these figures have improved to 5% surgical mortality for elective resection and 16% surgical mortality for emergency resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 5 year survival rates for the entire series were 50% for patients treated with elective operation, 30% for combined emergency and elective operation groups, and 21% for nonsurgically treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>Abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> was present in 74 patients (28%) and 23 of these patients had undergone a prior resection of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This series documents the improved survival of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the thoracic aorta who are treated with prompt surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It also further substantiates earlier findings of a high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the abdominal aorta in this patient population </plain></SENT>
