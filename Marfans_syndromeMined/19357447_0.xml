<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed survival data of 188 patients during follow-up period of 1 month to 20 years postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into the following groups according to the clinical course: Group 1--<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of ascending aorta with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> (42 patients, 22.3%); Group 2--<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> nondissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of ascending aorta with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> (146 patients, 77.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean NYHA functional class of the patients was 3.5+/-0.06 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the Group 1, 64.3% of the patients were in NYHA functional class IV; 35.7% of the patients were in NYHA class III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the Group 2, the majority of the patients (58.2%) were in class III; in class IV - 41.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common etiological factors in both groups were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No differences in overall and long-term survival rates between the groups were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the patients who were in class III before the operation showed significantly higher overall and long-term survival rates in comparison with the survival rate of the patients who were in NYHA class IV preoperatively (overall survival rate, 91.4+/-3.0% vs 62.9+/-6.9%; and long-term survival rate, 93.2+/-2.7% vs 72.9+/-5.6; respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 24 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (12.8%) during the late postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The main causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and infective prosthetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (Group 2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and dysfunction of the conduit (Group 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of patients' long-term survival demonstrated the efficacy of surgical treatment of such a complex pathology as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic valve regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The survival rate in the late postoperative period was higher in NYHA class III patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The main causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and infective prosthetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
