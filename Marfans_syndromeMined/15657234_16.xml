<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To review 13 years' data from a unit for grown ups with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (GUCH) to understand the change in surgical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Records were reviewed of patients over 16 years of age undergoing surgery between 1 January 1990 and 31 December 2002 in a dedicated GUCH unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defects</z:hpo> were included but not those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> or undergoing a first procedure for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valves</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three equal time periods of 52 months were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 474 operations performed, 162 (34.2%) were repeat operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentage of repeat operations increased from 24.8% (41 of 165) in January 1990-April 1994 to 49.7% (74 of 149) in September 1998-December 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mortality was 6.3% (n = 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median age decreased from 25.4 years (interquartile range 18.7) in January 1990-April 1994 to 23.9 (interquartile range 17.3) in September 1998-December 2002 (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients with a "simple" diagnosis decreased from 45.4% (74 or 165) in January 1990-April 1994 to 27.5% (41 of 149) in September 1998-December 2002 (p = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary valve replacements in operated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> increased from one case in January 1990-April 1994 to 23 cases in September 1998-December 2002 and conduit replacement increased from five cases to 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001684'>secundum atrial septal defect</z:hpo> closures decreased from 35 cases to 14 (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The estimated cost (not including salaries and prosthetics) incurred by an adult patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> was pound2290 compared with pound2641 for a patient undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite the impact of interventional cardiology, the total number of surgical procedures remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The complexity of the cases increased particularly with repeat surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the patients do well with low mortality and the inpatient costs remain comparable with costs of surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277564" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">acquired disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
