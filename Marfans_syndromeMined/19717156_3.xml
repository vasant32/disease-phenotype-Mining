<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We have previously shown that the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi> reduced aortic diameter by 3-7mm in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Excessive signalling by the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) has been implicated in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that reduction in aortic diameter would correlate with reduction in plasma TGF-beta and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 17 MFS patients (aged 33+/-5 (mean+/-SD)) on standard beta-blocker therapy were randomised to also receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi> (n=10) or placebo (n=7) for 24 weeks in a double blind study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aortic root diameters were assessed at four sites via transthoracic echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Venous blood samples were analysed for latent and active TGF-beta, MMP-2 and MMP-3 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">Perindopril</z:chebi> significantly reduced aortic root diameters relative to placebo in both end-systole and end-diastole (by 1.2-3mm/m(2), p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, compared to placebo <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi> significantly reduced latent TGF-beta levels by 14.0+/-4.5ng/ml (p=0.01), active TGF-beta levels by 4+/-1ng/ml (p=0.02), MMP-2 levels by 22+/-6ng/ml (p&lt;0.001), and MMP-3 levels by 5+/-1ng/ml (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were moderately strong correlations between the pre/post intervention change in aortic diameters and the change in both latent (r=0.49-0.76, p=0.001-0.04) and active TGF-beta (r=0.59-0.73, p=0.002-0.02), MMP-2 (r=0.63-0.75, p=0.001-0.007), and MMP-3 plasma levels (r=0.81-0.83, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Plasma TGF-beta, MMP-2 and MMP-3 should be further explored in longitudinal trials as potential prognostic indicators of progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> and response to therapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
