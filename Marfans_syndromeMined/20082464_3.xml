<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are several known single gene disorders that predispose to isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> and eventually <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FBN1 mutations are associated with multiple clinical phenotypes, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>), MASS phenotype, and familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo>, but rarely with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> and dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report, we describe three patients who presented with primary descending thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and who were found to have an FBN1 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the patients fulfilled clinical criteria for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had few or none of the skeletal features typical of the condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients had a history of long-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and such a history was suspected in the third patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that some individuals with FBN1 mutations have significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> involvement of other systems that is typical of FBN1 mutation-related syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Superimposed risk factors, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, may weaken the aortic wall and eventually lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Given that the cost continues to decrease, we suggest that diagnostic DNA sequencing for FBN1 mutations in patients with thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and dissection may be a practical clinical step in evaluating such patients and at-risk family members </plain></SENT>
