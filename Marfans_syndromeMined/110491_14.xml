<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One hundred consecutive cases of valve replacement for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> performed between 1967--1971 were analyzed to identify and quantitate factors related to a favorable result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 83 perioperative survivors, 78% (n = 65) became asymptomatic and 58% (n = 48) were alive 5--9 years postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> affected both the speed of progression of symptoms and the postoperative result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018801" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial failure</z:e> may be prevented by optimal timing of operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we identified variables that discriminated between patients who had an excellent postoperative result and those who died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018801" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial failure</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most important discriminators were the severity (p = 0.03) and duration (p = 0.04) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo>, the extent of therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (p = 0.001), physical findings of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023212" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">left ventricular failure</z:e> (p = 0.002), the cardiothoracic ratio (p = 0.007), the resting pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (p = 0.01), and a cardiac index less than 2.2 1/min/m2 (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023212" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">left ventricular failure</z:e>, even of mild degree, is an indication for operation in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
