<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A retrospective review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> operated on by a single surgeon was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen eyes of 12 patients were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients were males, with an average age of 24.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three eyes had a history of trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten eyes were successfully treated with scleral buckle and encircling band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three eyes were also treated with vitrectomy, scleral buckle, and encircling band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One hundred percent success was achieved with only one surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Best-corrected visual acuity of at least 20/40 was achieved in 7 of 12 eyes (58.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eight of 12 eyes (66.7%) had at least two lines of improvement on the Snellen chart after 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: With appropriate surgical intervention, an excellent anatomic reattachment rate and good visual outcome can be achieved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> regardless of their lens status </plain></SENT>
