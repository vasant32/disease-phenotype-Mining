<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is well known that congenital anomalies such as <z:mp ids='MP_0008528'>polycystic kidney</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001680'>aortic coarctation</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehler-Danlos syndrome</z:e> are apt to be complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report we attempt to reveal the relation and incidence between cerebrovascular anomalies and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> has been discussed, too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>12 cases of persistent trigeminl artery, 2 cases of persistent hypoglossal artery and 11 cases of fenestration were obtained from 3841 patients who were angiographically examined in our clinic for 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence is 0.31%, 0.05% and 0.29%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Persistent trigeminal arteries were complicated by 2 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> and one case of arterivenous malformations (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>), persistent hypoglossal arteries were complicated by one case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, and fenestrations were complicated by 2 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and one case of <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One case of congenital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_57'>agenesis</z:mpath> of right internal carotid artery was obtained which was complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of anterior communicating artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Totally, 8 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> were obtained from 26 cases of cerebrovascular anomalies (incidence 30.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, thalamic or caudate <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> revealed the highest incidence of complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> among intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> (10.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> between cerebro vascular anomalies (30.8%) and thalamic or caudate <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (10.7%), the difference is statistically signigicant (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> has not yet been clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>But it is well accepted that the defect of tunica media vasorum is most responsible factor as to the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We concluded that the genetic error of cerebral vessels including defect of media caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>, and this result was supported from the evidence that cerebrovascular anomalies showed statistically high incidence of complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
