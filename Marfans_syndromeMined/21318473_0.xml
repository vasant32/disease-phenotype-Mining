<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To establish the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003179'>protrusio acetabuli</z:hpo> (PA) in adults fulfilling the Ghent criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>), and in a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adult population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 105 adults with probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and 107 controls were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CT of the hips was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A qualitative assessment of PA was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A new method for estimating the degree of PA was introduced with measurement of the parameter CWD (circle-wall distance) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results were compared to an alternative method based on MRI [1] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 87 of the study group fulfilled the Ghent criteria of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> (Ghent positives), and 18 did not (Ghent negatives) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PA was diagnosed qualitatively in 74.7% of Ghent positive persons, in 27.8% of Ghent negative persons, and in 3.7% of the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CWD was significantly different between the three groups (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A slight but significant gender difference was found in Ghent positive persons only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The alternative method did not differentiate between the groups with respect to PA, but showed a significant difference between genders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PA was found significantly more often in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> persons than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our method was found to be robust and highly reproducible, giving a direct measurement of pelvic protrusion irrespective of pelvic shape </plain></SENT>
