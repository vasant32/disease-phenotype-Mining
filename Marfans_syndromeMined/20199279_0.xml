<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To describe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> of a Dacron aortic graft due to a post-thoracotomy dislocated rib fracture in a young Marfan patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: Six months after a successful open repair of a type II dissecting thoracoabdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> (TAAA), a 40-year-old woman with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> underwent elective repair of a post-thoracotomy dislocated rib fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the procedure, the graft ruptured; 2 TAG stent-grafts were emergently implanted to reline the existing aortic graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fractured rib was then resected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The postoperative course was uneventful, without residual leak at computed tomography at 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 18 months, the patient is well, without need of further operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early correction of any dislocated rib fracture close to a thoracic aortic graft should be considered, especially if the graft is not wrapped by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> sac </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these patients, in-graft endovascular relining associated with repair of the rib fracture may be a feasible and effective alternative to redo thoracotomy and surgical graft repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prior to attempting rib resection, appropriate thoracic endografts should be on hand in case an endovascular bailout is needed </plain></SENT>
