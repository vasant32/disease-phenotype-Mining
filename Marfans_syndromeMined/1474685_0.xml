<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The acuity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage in 3 patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage in 5 including 3 cases of re-do operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> operations were performed with an aid of extracorporeal circulation, blood cardioplegia, selective cerebral perfusion and open distal anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The operative techniques employed in this series consisted of total aortic root replacement using a composite graft (Bentall, Cabrol or Piehler's technique), and total arch replacement using en bloc arch reconstruction or three vessels graft replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patients underwent re-do operation for coronary anastomotic false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> following Bentall operation and aneurysmal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the false lumen at the aortic arch, and died of LOS because of the prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other seven patients survived the operation, and lead the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> life at the present time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present data suggests that type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> associated with AAE involving aortic arch could be treated by concomitant graft replacement of the total aortic root and the transverse aortic arch </plain></SENT>
