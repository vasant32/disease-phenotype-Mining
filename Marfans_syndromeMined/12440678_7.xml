<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To evaluate the impact of an aggressive surgical approach on early and late outcome in type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1983 to 2001, 240 patients underwent operation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (n = 138) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (n = 102) type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The extent of distal aortic resection included the ascending aorta in 39 (16%) patients, hemiarch (HAR) in 47 (20%), and total arch (TAR) in 154 (64%), including 19 patients who also had their descending aorta replaced (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DAR</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The in-hospital mortality did not differ between TAR with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DAR</z:e> and other more conservative techniques (12.3% versus 16.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival at 10 years including in-hospital mortality was 72.4% +/- 3.3% and freedom from reoperation was 77.2% +/- 3.6% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients: neither was influenced by the extent of distal aortic resection or acuity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed younger age and failure to resect the intimal tear to be independent determinants for late reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in contrast to 22 patients who had more conservative operations, none of the patients with TAR required reoperation on the aortic arch through a sternotomy incision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An aggressive surgical approach did not adversely influence early and late survival following type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>; it reduced the necessity of late reoperation and facilitated distal aortic reoperation </plain></SENT>
