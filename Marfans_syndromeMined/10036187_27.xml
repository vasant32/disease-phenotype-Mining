<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This gene is divided into 65 exons and was previously reported to be approximately 110 kb in length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The existence of 3 exons upstream of the exon containing the putative initiating methionine left open the possibility of alternative fibrillin-1 isoforms that vary at their N-termini </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Detailed examination of YACs containing human FBN1 reveal that the gene is 200 kb, almost twice as large as previously thought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Characterization of the porcine FBN1 cDNA and 5' flanking sequence demonstrates extreme conservation between the pig and the human predicted proteins and argues against the possibility of alternative amino-terminal coding sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data further our understanding of the regulatory requirements for gene expression and establish a framework for recombinant expression of fibrillin-1 </plain></SENT>
