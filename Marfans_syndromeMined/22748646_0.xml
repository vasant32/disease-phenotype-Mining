<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We reviewed our experience with valve-sparing aortic root reconstruction (VSARR) using the sinus of Valsalva graft in children, teenagers, and young adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Results of a single-center experience with VSARR in children, teenagers, and young adults were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>End points were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, freedom from reintervention, and freedom from valve dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 2003 and 2010, 16 patients (Marfan, 9; Loeys Dietz syndrome, 6; conotruncal, 1) underwent VSARR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 20±7.4 (range, 9 to 36 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indications for VSAAR were aortic root enlargement in 14 (sinus of Valsalva Z-score, 6.2±2) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional procedures included replacement of the ascending aorta in 7, with additional replacement of the aortic arch in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No early or late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient required a pacemaker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome required reoperation for aneurysmal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the coronary buttons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients underwent replacement of the thoracoabdominal aorta for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Follow-up by echocardiography or magnetic resonance imaging at a mean of 33±29 months showed more than mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Both patients with moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> also had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: VSARR using the sinus of Valsalva graft is a reproducible technique that achieves acceptable early and intermediate results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It is suitable for children, teenagers, and young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation is avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The procedure is appropriate for emergency operations but should be used with caution in patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
