<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study describes the outcome in 164 pregnant women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> (158 deliveries in women in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classes 1 and 2; 17 in NYHA Classes 3 and 4) who received good antenatal care and benefitted from a specific protocol and experience of a dedicated staff </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were no maternal or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003811'>neonatal deaths</z:hpo>; 46 women were diagnosed peripartum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on a sub-division into NYHA categories, and when sub-divided by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>, there were no statistically significant differences between groups with regard to maternal age, gestational age at admission or at delivery, birth weight, 5 min Apgar scores, mode of delivery (caesarean delivery), senior obstetric/anaesthesiology staff in attendance or delivery during day/working hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a higher incidence of pre-term deliveries in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="rhd">rheumatic heart disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (p = 0.06) relative to others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Babies of women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> had prolonged postpartum course in the NICU (p = 0.0001) and longer total hospital stays for the mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, well-managed, motivated mothers with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> who benefit from comprehensive antenatal care, and are managed primarily by their obstetric and anaesthesia teams, can aspire to a good outcome for themselves and their babies </plain></SENT>
