<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that prophylactic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35530">beta-adrenergic blocker</z:chebi> is effective in reducing the aortic distensibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, its fetal toxicity should be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It includes <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Landiolol <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> is a new <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35530">beta-adrenergic blocker</z:chebi> of which greatest advantages are its short duration of action, rapid clearance and high beta 1-selectivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This drug has not been evaluated in its maternal and fetal effects on human pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We report a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> complicated with 49 mm annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>She received landiolol for the prevention of aggravated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> during cesarean section </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After the administration of spinal anesthesia, she was treated with landiolol by continuous infusion at a rate of 0.003 to 0.005 mg.kg-1.min-1 until delivery of 1764 g infant with Apgar scores of 5 (1 min) and 8 (5 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We could maintain maternal hemodynamics stable and good post cesarean uterus contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No severe adverse effects were observed in the infant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, it is useful for maintaining the hemodynamics stable in a pregnant woman with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and keep the infant safe from any adverse effects by infusing of landiolol </plain></SENT>
