<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because fibrillin microfibrils appear to be abnormal in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, fibrillin is a candidate for the gene defect in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Derived clones from fibrillin cDNA were used as probes in isotopic and nonisotopic in situ hybridization studies to map the chromosomal location of the fibrillin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fluorescent signals were found on chromosome 15 band q21.1; an excess of silver grains was noted over a similar region of chromosome 15 following in situ hybridization with a <z:chebi fb="13" ids="29298">tritium</z:chebi>-labeled probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with linkage studies that localize the Marfan gene to chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
