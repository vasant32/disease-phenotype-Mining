<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: During development of thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> in a mouse model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 was accompanied by compromised aortic constriction and endothelium-dependent relaxation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">Losartan</z:chebi> has been proposed for the prevention of thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> would suppress MMP-2/-9 activation and improve aortic vasomotor function in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: A well-characterized mouse model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (Fbn1(C1039G/+)) was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Starting at 6 weeks old, Marfan mice were untreated or given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> (0.6 g.L(-1) in drinking water, n= 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The littermate Fbn1(+/+) mice served as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thoracic aortas were studied at 3, 6 and 9 months by histology and by contractility assays in isolated segments in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">Losartan</z:chebi> improved elastic fibre organization and increased aortic breaking stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">Losartan</z:chebi> reduced the activity and protein expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aortic constriction in response to membrane depolarization or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> was increased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> at 3 and 9 months by 100-200% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Active force of aortic smooth muscle was also increased at 6 and 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">Acetylcholine</z:chebi>-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation was improved by 30% after 3 months of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> treatment, but such improvement disappeared with longer duration of treatment, accompanied by reduced phosphorylation of endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) synthase(Ser1177), Akt(Thr308) and Akt(Ser473), compared with the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">Losartan</z:chebi> improved the contractile function of aorta and reduced MMP activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the endothelial NO pathway remained suppressed in the thoracic aorta during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> treatment, which might limit its long-term benefits in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
