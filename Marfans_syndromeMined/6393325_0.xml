<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The various pathological types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> are reviewed and their natural history discussed in relation to <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, etiology and site of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For diagnostic purposes, computed tomography is a reliable method in the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo>; for evaluation of the ascending segment, ultrasonography may also be considered a useful procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two non-invasive methods are particularly valuable in monitoring patients with thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> not (yet) suitable for surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the light of the literature and our own experience, practical guidelines for adequate treatment of non-dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the thoracic aorta are elaborated with respect to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with anulo-aortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath>, surgical treatment is clearly indicated in the presence of typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and in cases showing a demonstrable increase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and/or of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> (hospital mortality 5% in our experience); irrespective of these criteria, surgery should be considered if the echocardiographic root diameter is greater than 6 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Replacement of the aortic arch carries a high surgical risk and is suggested for patients suffering from symptoms such as pain or compression of adjacent tissues; in asymptomatic patients, arch resection is scarcely advisable unless the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is of luetic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the descending aorta, the operative indication will also be related to clinical symptoms as well as to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> expansion and growth; in asymptomatic subjects, surgery is recommended in the presence of a circumscribed posttraumatic false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, the operative risk being very low in this patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In cases with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, computed tomography is considered to be the primary diagnostic procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Angiography may be mandatory only for those few presurgical candidates who require accurate assessment of aortic valvular regurgitation and determination of peripheral organ perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The extremely unfavourable natural history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (50% survival after 48 hours following <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms) clearly calls for immediate operative treatment in high-risk patients, that is in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004933'>ascending aortic dissection</z:hpo> (hospital mortality 28% in our series) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The better prognosis of descending <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> suggests that in these cases conservative hypotensive therapy is the treatment of choice; surgical intervention in type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection is indicated only if occlusion of a major aortic branch occurs or if impending rupture of the dissecting <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> becomes evident.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
