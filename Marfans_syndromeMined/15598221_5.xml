<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report a family in which two out of four individuals, an 18-year-old son and his mother, a 41-year-old woman, had the R2726W mutation of FBN1 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The son had a Marfan-like phenotype, but his mother did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The FBN1 R2776W mutation, which is associated with skeletal features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, appears incompletely penetrant </plain></SENT>
