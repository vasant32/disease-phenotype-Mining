<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to search for clinical and molecular prognostic factors that could be associated with length of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Probands ascertained via the framework of the Universal Marfan database-FBN1, diagnosed before the age of 1 y and presenting with cardiovascular features (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> or valvular insufficiency) were included in this study </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 60 individuals, 38 had died, 82% died before the age of 1 y, mostly because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two FBN1 mutations were found outside of the exon 24-32 region (in exons 4 and 21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mutations in exons 25-26 were overrepresented and were associated with shorter survival (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this population, factors significantly associated with shorter survival are presence of valvular insufficiencies or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000776'>diaphragmatic hernia</z:hpo> in addition to a mutation in exons 25 or 26 </plain></SENT>
