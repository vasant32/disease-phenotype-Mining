<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease spectrum is wide and while many genotype-phenotype correlations have been reported, few have been consistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study FBN1 was analyzed in 113 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> or Marfan-like features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three mutations were identified in 52 individuals, 41 of which were novel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mutations comprised 26 missense, 11 splice site, 7 frameshift, 6 nonsense, 1 in-frame deletion, and 2 whole exon deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In common with previous studies, genotype-phenotype analysis showed that a FBN1 mutation was more likely to be identified in patients fulfilling Ghent criteria (P = 0.005) and in those who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> (EL) (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other previously reported genotype-phenotype correlations were also considered and a new inverse association between a mutation in exons 59-65, and EL emerged (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
