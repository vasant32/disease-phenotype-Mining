<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> model we investigated the structural and functional characteristics of aortic wall degeneration in adult fibulin-4 deficient mice and the potential therapeutic role of the angiotensin (Ang) II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> in preventing aortic media degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult mice with 2-fold (heterozygous Fibulin-4(+/R)) and 4-fold (homozygous Fibulin-4(R/R)) reduced expression of fibulin-4 displayed the histological features of cystic media degeneration as found in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> or dissection, including elastin fiber fragmentation, loss of smooth muscle cells, and deposition of ground substance in the extracellular matrix of the aortic media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aortic contractile capacity, determined by isometric force measurements, was diminished, and was associated with dysregulation of contractile genes as shown by aortic transcriptome analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These structural and functional alterations were accompanied by upregulation of TGF-β signaling in aortas from fibulin-4 deficient mice, as identified by genome-scaled network analysis as well as by immunohistochemical staining for phosphorylated Smad2, an intracellular mediator of TGF-β </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tissue levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi>, a regulator of TGF-β signaling, were increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prenatal treatment with the AT(1) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi>, which blunts TGF-β signaling, prevented elastic fiber fragmentation in the aortic media of newborn Fibulin-4(R/R) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postnatal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> treatment reduced haemodynamic stress and improved lifespan of homozygous knockdown fibulin-4 animals, but did not affect aortic vessel wall structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the AT(1) receptor blocker <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> can prevent aortic media degeneration in a non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In established <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> does not affect aortic architecture, but does improve survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings may extend the potential therapeutic application of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system to the preventive treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
