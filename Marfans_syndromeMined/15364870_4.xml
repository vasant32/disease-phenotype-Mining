<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the outcome of 3 different surgical approaches for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> type A (AADA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Between October 1990 and October 2003, we operated on 295 patients (pts) for AADA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was complete for 257 pts (87%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Supracommissural replacement (SCR) of the ascending aorta was applied to 145 pts, 64 pts received a composite replacement (comp), and 48 pts were treated with the aorta valve-sparing (AVS) reimplantation technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pts in SCR were older compared with AVS and comp (P=0.002), gender (overall 65% male, P=0.143) and presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (overall 5%, P=0.109) were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cannulation of the aorta was performed more often in AVS (58%) than in comp (19%) or SCR (22%; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean operation time, extracorporeal circulation time, and aortic cross-clamp time differ significantly between groups (P&lt;0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stay in the intensive care unit (P=0.12) and time of hospitalization (P=0.32) were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall perioperative mortality was 24% and did not show significant differences between groups (AVS 10.4% versus comp 28% versus SCR 26%; P=0.053) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Incidence of neurological complications was similar between groups (P=0.95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean time of follow-up was shorter for AVS (19+/-20 months) compared with comp (48+/-48 months) and SCR (46+/-45 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Survival at 5 years was comparable with 89% for AVS, 85% for comp, and 80% for SCR (P=0.61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients from AVS (4.1%) required reoperation for failure of the reconstructed valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Pts in comp required less aortic reoperations than pts in SCR (comp 6.3% versus SCR 22%; P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> type A, the reimplantation technique leads to results comparable to established techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Complete removal of diseased tissue, low incidence of reoperation, and lack of anticoagulation may favor this approach in selected patients </plain></SENT>
