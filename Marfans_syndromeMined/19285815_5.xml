<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> are associated with sudden, unexpected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to dissection and/or rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In such cases, the latent, preceding state of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> has often gone undiagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a consequence of the sudden unresolved <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, medico-legal autopsy requested by a public prosecutor will be the consequence to establish the cause and manner of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Usually, autopsy records do not include relevant information for differential diagnosis of heritable syndromic and non-syndromic diseases associated with thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo>/dissections (TAAD), including e.g. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and isolated thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo>/dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, for at-risk relatives of the deceased, it could be of great benefit to be alerted to the potential heritable aetiology, because early diagnosis of the latent stage of the disease would allow preventive management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Such attempts, including recommendations to seek genetic counselling, are nevertheless rarely made in the context of medico-legal autopsies, in which primarily the legal aspects are considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We report here on three cases to underline the practical relevance of (i) documentation of relevant information for differential diagnosis of TAAD-associated disorders, (ii) storage of unfixed tissue samples for subsequent molecular genetic testing, and most importantly (iii) the information of relatives at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In view of the general ethical principal of nonmaleficience, direct or indirect contact with family members of victims of possible heritable forms of TAAD should be established as a standard of care, also in the medico-legal setting </plain></SENT>
