<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The use of new techniques to correct <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> due to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> of the anterior leaflet has been shown to expand the original surgical armamentarium and to improve postoperative outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analysed our experience with isolated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> of the anterior mitral leaflet repaired using the edge-to-edge technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From October 1986 to June 2004, 790 patients underwent mitral valve repair for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Isolated pathology of the anterior mitral leaflet, due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1285162" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">degenerative disease</z:e>, was the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> in 84 patients and, from 1991, 68 underwent edge-to-edge repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and one in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients died in the late follow-up period for a cumulative 13-year survival rate of 90 +/- 1.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patient underwent early reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients underwent reoperation during the follow-up for a cumulative 13-year freedom from reoperation of 92.3 +/- 3.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At echocardiographic evaluation, mitral valve repair failure was associated with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 60 patients, 40 had no residual regurgitation, 18 had trivial residual regurgitation, and two had mild regurgitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, 49 patients are still in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I, 14 in NYHA class II and only one in NYHA class III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that the 'edge-to-edge' technique is a reliable procedure to correct prolapsing leaflets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The addition of this technique to the surgical armamentarium has neutralized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> of the anterior leaflet as an incremental risk factor for reoperation </plain></SENT>
