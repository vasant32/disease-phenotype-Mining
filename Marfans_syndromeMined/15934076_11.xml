<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have suggested that fibrillin 1 mediates <z:mp ids='MP_0009932'>skin fibrosis</z:mp> via its interface with associated microfibrillar proteins and type I collagen; in particular, microfibril-associated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 2 (MAGP-2), an extracellular matrix protein that binds to fibrillins and the alphavbeta3 integrin, is increased in TSK mouse and human <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because the function of MAGP-2 in the biologic processes of the matrix remains unknown, this study investigated whether MAGP-2 regulates type I collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fibroblast cultures conditionally overexpressing MAGP-2 were developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cells were analyzed by Western blotting, Northern blotting, pulse-chase analysis, and immunofluorescence to assess the effect of MAGP-2 on type I collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cells overexpressing MAGP-2 formed increased MAGP-2 matrix and showed a 3-fold increase in intracellular type I procollagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This increase was associated with increased levels of type I collagen in the medium and matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased type I collagen colocalized with the MAGP-2 matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAGP-2 overexpression had no effect on type I procollagen <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi>, but markedly increased the half-life of type I procollagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MAGP-2 induced type I collagen even under conditions in which no MAGP-2 matrix was detectable, and did not require the presence of the RGD motif of MAGP-2 in its integrin-binding site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study shows that MAGP-2 stabilizes type I procollagen, identifying an important function of MAGP-2 in extracellular matrix homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It also suggests that MAGP-2 might mediate <z:mp ids='MP_0009932'>skin fibrosis</z:mp> in TSK mice and in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
