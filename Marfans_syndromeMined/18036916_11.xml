<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In this study, we evaluated the long-term results of our contemporary, standardized surgical management algorithm for repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prior reports have analyzed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> techniques and populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1993 to 2004, 221 consecutive patients underwent repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> at our aortic center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hemiarch repair was performed in 97.7% (216 of 221), and total arch in 2.3% (5 of 221) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, 72.9% (161 of 221) underwent aortic valve resuspension, and 27.1% (60 of 221) had aortic root replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In-hospital mortality for a primary operation was 12.7% (28 of 221) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival was 79.2% at 1 year, 62.8% at 5 years, and 46.3% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant risk factors for decreased survival included prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, cerebral malperfusion, and length of cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Freedom from proximal reoperation after aortic valve resuspension was 94.6% at 5 years and 76.8% at 10 years, with cardiac malperfusion as the main risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Freedom from distal reoperation was 87.6% at 5 years and 76.4% at 10 years, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, age, and extent of dissection as significant risk factors for reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In-hospital mortality was 18.2% (2 of 11) after proximal reoperation and 31.2% (5 of 16) after distal reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We report improved long-term durability of our proximal root repair, with cardiac malperfusion as a significant risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Marfan disease, younger age, and DeBakey type I dissection are risk factors for distal reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>To further improve long-term outcome, means to prevent progression of distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> need to be developed </plain></SENT>
