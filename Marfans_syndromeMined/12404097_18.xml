<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In combination with the study of natural and transgenic animal models, this new information provides greater insight into the pathogenic mechanisms underlying not only the pleiotropic manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> but also the important degree of clinical variability (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> and severity) observed between patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following aspects will be described in this review: the structure and function of fibrillin-1; the fibrillin proteins; mutations in the FBN1 gene and pathogenic mechanisms; animal models </plain></SENT>
