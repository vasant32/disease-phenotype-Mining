<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To define the incidence of these complications, 30 patients were evaluated after surgical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> at the Texas Heart Institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To provide a minimal follow-up period of 5 years, only patients operated upon during of before 1968 were included in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 9 female and 21 male patients aged 4 to 80 years (mean 44 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>Aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> was treated by valvuloplasty in 3 patients and by aortic valve replacement in 27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Graft replacement of the ascending aorta was required in 23 patients, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was excised and the aorta repaired by direct anastomosis in 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients were lost to follow-up study; 12 of the remaining 28 (42.8 percent) lived 5 years or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hospital mortality rate was 20 percent (6 of 30); the causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> included dissection or rupture of the aorta in three patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> in two and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 24 survivors lived from 5 weeks to 9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up data were available on 22 of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ten of these (45.4 percent) died of late complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seven died suddenly, four of these had redissection, one patient had occlusion of the right coronary artery, and two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> of no apparent cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The remaining three died of noncardiac causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although the risk of ascending aortic and aortic valve surgery in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> is high, 42.8 percent of the patients in our series survived 5 years or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We believe that surgery should be recommended for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's disease</z:e> who have dissection of the aorta or severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, or both </plain></SENT>
