<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The condition is caused by mutations in the gene (FBN1) encoding fibrillin-1, a major constituent of extracellular microfibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prior observations suggested that a deficiency of microfibrils causes failure of elastic fiber assembly during late fetal development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice homozygous for a targeted hypomorphic allele (mgR) of Fbn1 revealed a predictable sequence of abnormalities in the vessel wall including elastic fiber calcification, excessive deposition of matrix elements, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306863" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elastolysis</z:e>, and intimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we describe previously unrecognized concordant findings in elastic vessels from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ultrastructural analysis of mgR mice revealed cellular events that initiate destructive changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first detectable abnormality was an unusually smooth surface of elastic laminae, manifesting the <z:mp ids='MP_0000340'>loss of cell</z:mp> attachments that are normally mediated by fibrillin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adjacent cells adopted alteration in their expression profile accompanied by morphological changes but retained expression of vascular smooth muscle cell markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The abnormal synthetic repertoire of these morphologically abnormal smooth muscle cells in early vascular lesions included elastin, among other matrix elements, and matrix metalloproteinase 9, a known mediator of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306863" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elastolysis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ultimately, cell processes associated with zones of elastic fiber thinning and fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the <z:mp ids='MP_0000340'>loss of cell</z:mp> attachments signals a nonproductive program to synthesize and remodel an elastic matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This refined understanding of the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> will facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
