<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1993 to 2008, 94 patients underwent valve-sparing aortic root replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty patients (64%), average age 33 years (range, 15 to 61 years), had inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e>: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, 54 (92%); Loeys-Dietz syndrome, 5 (8%); and smooth muscle Î±-actin (ACTA2) mutation in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median preoperative sinus diameter was 52 mm (range, 42 to 76 mm), and moderate/severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> was present in 14 (23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven (12%, 1993 to 1999) underwent remodeling procedures, and 53 had reimplantation procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cusp repair was performed in 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 55 months (range, 1 to 149 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 15 patients in the early term (1993 to 2000) and 45 in the late term (2001 to 2008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred (cardiac, 3; aortic, 1), with 10-year survival of 86% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rates of freedom from aortic valve replacement at 5 and 10 years were 85% and 58% in remodeling and 96% and 58% in reimplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for reoperations were postprocedure intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> greater than mild (p = 0.046), remodeling procedure (p = 0.016), and early term (p = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient (2%) with none/trivial postprocedure <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> required aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Freedom from reoperation in patients with none/trivial postprocedure <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> at 5 and 10 years was 100% and 67% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Meticulous control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> during operation would bring favorable midterm durability in valve-sparing aortic root replacement using a reimplantation technique, even in patients with inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
