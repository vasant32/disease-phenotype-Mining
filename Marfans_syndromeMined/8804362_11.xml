<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Most patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (&gt; 95%) and 75% of patients with uncertain diagnosis can be classified into four groups (Aoyama et al, 1994, 1995) based on abnormal patterns of synthesis, intracellular transport, and/or matrix deposition of fibrillin-1 in fibroblast cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Herein we report a systematic study of fibrillin assembly in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> fibroblasts and correlations between pulse-chase, immunofluorescence, and immunoelectron microscopic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> control fibroblasts were grown at confluent conditions from 2 to 10 days before passage and then maintained at hyperconfluent cell densities for an additional period of 1 to 6 days before assaying </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Maximum deposition in the extracellular matrix of pulse-labeled fibrillin required at least 6 days of confluent and 4 to 5 days of hyperconfluent culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This result is explained by immunofluorescence studies with fibrillin-1-specific antibodies, because 1 day after seeding cells at hyperconfluency, patches of regular immunostained structures were already present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within these patches, fluorescence intensity and fibrillar material increased over 3 to 4 days, and after only 5 days, fibrillar networks extended throughout the culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose that fibrillin-containing microfibrillar material is passaged together with the cells, newly synthesized fibrillin molecules are deposited onto preexisting microfibrillar assemblies, and several additional days of culture at high cell density are necessary for the cells to construct a sufficient microfibrillar network binding and detection of pulse-labeled fibrillin molecules in insoluble form during a 20-hour chase period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This fraction is decreased to a varying extent in fibroblast cultures of four biosynthetically distinct groups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> patients, but only Groups II and IV clearly showed reduction in immunostainable microfibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In long-term cultures, immunoelectron microscopy of the extracellular matrix with fibrillin antibodies also detected differences among these groups and in comparison to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls with respect to the arrangement of fibrillin-containing microfibrils, thickness of microfibrillar bundles, and the presence of amorphous material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data support the idea of different pathogenetic mechanisms for each biosynthetically defined group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, which depends on the nature of fibrillin-1 mutations </plain></SENT>
