<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005111'>Dilatation of the ascending aorta</z:hpo> is extremely rare and may be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report evaluates the incidence of dilatative aortic root and ascending aortic pathology in patients younger than 18 years and analyzes the results obtained after repair and replacement strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1/1995 and 12/2002, a total of 752 operations on the thoracic aorta were performed in adult and pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We present our experience with a group of 26 patients &lt;18 years of age, who required isolated surgery of the aortic root and/or ascending aorta because of a dilatative lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients had isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> (13 of them suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>), eight patients presented with an idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005111'>dilatation of the ascending aorta</z:hpo> and three patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> in association with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 10 +/- 4.8 years (4-18 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Repair of the aortic root with preservation of the aortic valve (Yacoub, David or selective sinus repair) was performed in nine patients, replacement using a homograft was performed in five patients, composite graft with mechanical prosthesis in two patients, with biological prosthesis in one patient and Ross operation was performed in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Isolated supracoronary graft replacement was performed in eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two patients died during hospitalization: a 10-year old girl developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> on the 2nd postoperative day and autopsy revealed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e> with a massive intrapulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002097'>emphysema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A 14-year-old Marfan patient with severely depressed preoperative LV function died from low cardiac output following composite-graft, mitral and tricuspid valve repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient required aortic valve replacement 7 days after an aortic valve sparing root repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no additional perioperative morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the long-term, two patients died from rupture of the thoracic aorta, both following minor non-cardiovascular surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Both had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sized descending and abdominal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Repair of the aortic root and/or ascending aorta in children and adolescent patients can be performed with acceptable early and late results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>While the presence of severe comorbidity may adversely affect early outcome, long-term survival was mainly determined by rupture of the descending aorta </plain></SENT>
