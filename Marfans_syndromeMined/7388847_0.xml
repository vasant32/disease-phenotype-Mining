<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A dacron sleeve (extending from 3 cm above the sinuses of Valsalva to just distal to the left subclavian artery) was placed around the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2 years later the child succumbed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and rupture distal to the sleeve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Autopsy showed (1) complete healing of the earlier dissection, and (2) lack of aneurysmal progression within the sleeve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the sleeve had provided effective support to the diseased aorta, it did not have sufficient length and should have been extended to include the region of the first and second intercostal arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The use of an extensive dacron sleeve is potentially useful as treatment prior to dissection </plain></SENT>
