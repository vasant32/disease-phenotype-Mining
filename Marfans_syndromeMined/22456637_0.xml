<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to clarify the influence of the clinical presentation on the outcome, we analyzed the patients of the International Registry of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic Dissection</z:hpo> (IRAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients affected by complicated ABAD, enrolled in the IRAD from 1996-2004, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complications were defined as the presence of shock, periaortic <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752130" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord ischemia</z:e>, preoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920157" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mesenteric ischemia</z:e>/infarction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo>, limb <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, recurrent pain, refractory pain or refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (group I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other patients were categorized as uncomplicated (group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive analysis was performed of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinical variables in relation to in-hospital outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall in-hospital mortality among 550 patients was 12.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mortality in group I (250 patients) was 20.0 %, compared to 6.1% in group II (300 patients) (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate predictors of ABAD complications were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, abrupt <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of pain, migrating pain, any focal neurological deficits, need for higher number of diagnostic examinations and use of magnetic resonance and/or aortogram, abdominal vessels involvement at aortogram, larger descending aortic diameter, especially &gt;6 cm, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusion</z:hpo>, and widened mediastinum on chest X-ray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Univariate predictors of a non complicated status were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chest X-ray and medical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In group I, in-hospital mortality following surgical and endovascular intervention were 28.6% and 10.1% (P=0.006), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors of overall in-hospital mortality included age &gt;70 years, female gender, ECG showing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo>, preoperative limb <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, periaortic <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, and surgical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The only independent variable protective for mortality was magnetic resonance as diagnostic test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ABAD is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disease that produces dissimilar clinical subsets, each of which can have specific clinical signs, management and in-hospital results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In IRAD ABAD uncomplicated patients, medical therapy was associated with best hospital outcome, while endovascular interventions were associated with better results than surgery when invasive treatments were required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although selection bias may be possible, and irrespective of treatments, knowledge of significant risk factors for mortality may contribute to a better management and a more defined risk-assessment in patients affected by ABAD </plain></SENT>
