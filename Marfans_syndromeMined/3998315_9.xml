<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with an average age of 58 years underwent valve replacement because of isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> with severe regurgitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>None had clinical evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> or another <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> that would indicate that a primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> was the cause of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 10 patients had a dome configuration of the posterior leaflet and one or more ruptured chordae related to it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The gross <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the resected specimens revealed marked deviations in chordal branching and the pattern of anchoring in each of the 10 cases, rendering the most severely affected parts of the leaflets less well supported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar changes occurred at sites remote from the principal abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microscopically, the dominant tissue change was myxomatous transformation within the affected leaflets and chordae with secondary changes at both atrial and ventricular surfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings could indicate that insufficient chordal support may have promoted the development of the floppy valve through a process of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> undue and unbalanced stress on the valve tension and closure apparatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The resultant degeneration of the connective tissues, histologically expressed as myxomatous transformation, may underlie stretching and thus redundance of the leaflets and eventually rupture of chordae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that this sequence of events be considered as a possible pathogenetic mechanism of isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, particularly in the subset of aged patients </plain></SENT>
