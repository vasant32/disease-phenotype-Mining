<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five patients and eight non-carriers in the two families underwent complete physical, ophthalmic, and cardiovascular examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes of venous blood of these individuals in the families as well as 100 healthy <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and direct sequencing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 65 coding exons of FBN1 were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The functional consequences of the mutations were analyzed with various genomic resources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two novel mutations of FBN1 were identified in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One is a splice defect in intron 17 (IVS 17-1G&gt;T) adjacent to exon 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other is c.6182G&gt;T in exon 50, which results in the substitution of cysteine by phenylalanine at codon 2,061 (p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>C2061F) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We provided strong evidences that the splice mutation would potentially lead to the skipping of exons after intron 17 and that the missense mutation at codon 2,061 (p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>C2061F) would destroy a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bond </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We detected two novel mutations in FBN1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results expand the mutation spectrum of FBN1 and help in the study of the molecular pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and Marfan-related disorders </plain></SENT>
