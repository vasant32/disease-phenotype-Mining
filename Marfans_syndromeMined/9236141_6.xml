<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, our ultimate goal was to identify the region(s) of the fibrillin 1 (FBN1) gene mainly involved in the health of the heart and of the aorta in terms of the cardiovascular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We searched for a molecular defect in three patients with classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mutations were detected applying heteroduplex analysis to each of the 65 exons of the FBN1 gene amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exons containing heteroduplex bands were sequenced directly from PCR products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study reports the detection of three unique missense mutations in the FBN1 gene in three Italian patients: a 44-year-old adult male and 36-year-old female affected by classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> (with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cardinal manifestations in the cardiovascular, ocular and skeletal systems), and an 11-year-old male affected by infantile (earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first two are <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases and present a<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29950,32737"> Cys--</z:chebi>&gt;Arg amino acid substitution (T--&gt;C substitution at nucleotide 7729) in exon 62 and a<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29950,32737"> Cys--</z:chebi>&gt;Tyr amino acid substitution (G--&gt;A substitution at nucleotide 6695) in exon 54 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The third is a familial case which presents a<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29950,32737"> Cys--</z:chebi>&gt;Trp aminoacidic substitution (C--&gt;G substitution at nucleotide 3546) in exon 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data confirm that cysteine substitutions in calcium binding epidermal growth factor (cbEGF)-like domains cause severe Marfan phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Exon 24-32 cluster seems to produce an even more severe phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The early characterization may be of clinical relevance for prevention and early surgical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> or dissection </plain></SENT>
