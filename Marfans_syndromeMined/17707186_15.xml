<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We sought to demonstrate the long-term natural course of <z:mp ids='MP_0010473'>descending aorta dilation</z:mp> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (AD) and identify early predictors for late aneurysmal change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Aneurysmal dilation of the aorta is a critical late complication in AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) was performed during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase in 100 AD patients, comprising 51 type 1 who underwent ascending aorta surgery and 49 type 3 AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical observation was conducted for 53 +/- 26 months, and CT was repeated for 31 +/- 27 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysm</z:hpo> (diameter &gt; or =60 mm) occurred in 14.4%, 8.2%, 4.1%, and 3.1% of patients at the upper descending thoracic aorta (UT), mid descending thoracic aorta (MT), lower descending thoracic aorta (LT) and abdominal aorta (AA), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 53 patients in whom CT was repeated for &gt; or =2 years, the rates of aorta diameter enlargement at the UT, MT, LT, and AA levels were 3.43 +/- 3.66 mm/year, 3.21 +/- 2.70 mm/year, 2.62 +/- 2.19 mm/year, and 1.93 +/- 3.13 mm/year, respectively (p &lt; 0.01), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> developed in 15 (28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The initial false lumen diameter at the UT, the aorta diameter at the MT, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> were independent predictors of late <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A &gt; or =22-mm initial false lumen diameter at the UT predicted late <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 76% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients with initial UT false lumen diameter &gt; or =22-mm (n = 42) showed higher event rate (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) than others (n = 58) (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The UT is the major site of late aneurysmal dilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A large UT false lumen diameter on the initial CT portends late <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and adverse outcome warranting early intervention </plain></SENT>
