<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the mid-term outcomes, and the aortic remodeling in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) patients with type B dissection that were treated with endovascular repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> is a relative contraindication to thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mid-term aortic outcomes data in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> after TEVAR are limited, and the occurrence of late events remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 89 patients that underwent TEVAR between September 2002 and February 2011, 10 patients with mid-term follow-up fulfilled the Ghent criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and complicated type B dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High risk for open surgery was documented in 90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 35.1 ± 9.4 years and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> aortic syndrome complicating a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type B dissection (DeBakey type IIIb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five patients underwent a Bentall surgical procedure previous to endovascular repair, and in four patients initial TEVAR was followed by surgery of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment was limited to endovascular repair in only one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In-hospital mortality was 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At a mean follow-up of 59.6 ± 38.9 months, the cumulated mortality was of 20% and late mortality 11.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The rate of secondary endoleak was 44.4%, and late reintervention of 33.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Survival freedom from cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 8 years was 80.0%, and positive remodeling was documented in 37.5% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that TEVAR is feasible, safe, and associated with a high reintervention rate and reduced rate of positive aortic remodeling in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
