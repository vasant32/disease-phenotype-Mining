<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Genetic disorders</z:e> are an important cause of thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAAs</z:chebi>) in young patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite advances in the treatment of genetically triggered <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAAs</z:chebi>, the optimal syndrome-specific treatment approach remains undefined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used data from the National Institutes of Health-funded, multicenter National Registry of Genetically Triggered Thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>Aortic Aneurysms</z:hpo> and Cardiovascular Conditions (GenTAC) to characterize the contemporary surgical treatment of patients with genetically triggered <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: GenTAC's aim is to collect longitudinal clinical data and banked biospecimens from 2800 patients with genetically triggered <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed data from the 606 patients (mean age, 37.5 years) enrolled in GenTAC to date whose clinical data were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients' primary diagnoses included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (35.8%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (29.2%), and familial <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAAs</z:chebi> and dissections (10.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 56.4% had undergone at least one operation; the most common indications were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (85.7%), valve dysfunction (65.8%), and dissection (25.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgical procedures included replacement of the aortic root (50.6%), ascending aorta (64.8%), aortic arch (27.9%), and descending or thoracoabdominal aorta (12.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Syndrome-specific differences in age, indications for operation, and procedure type were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with genetically transmitted <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAAs</z:chebi> evaluated in tertiary care centers frequently undergo surgical repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysm</z:hpo> repairs most commonly involve the aortic root and ascending aorta; distal repairs are less common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Like <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAAs</z:chebi> themselves, complications of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAAs</z:chebi>, including dissection and aortic valve dysfunction, are important indications for intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Future studies will focus on syndrome- and gene-specific phenotypes, biomarkers, treatments, and outcomes to improve the treatment of patients with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
