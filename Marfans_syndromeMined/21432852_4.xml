<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin-1, the major component of extracellular microfibrils that associate with insoluble elastin in elastic fibres, is mainly synthesized during development and postnatal growth and is believed to guide elastogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0559758" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">multisystem disorder</z:e> characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and dissections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The recent finding that early deficiency of elastin modifies vascular ageing has raised the possibility that fibrillin-1 deficiency could also contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> pathology of vascular remodelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To address this question, we examined cardiovascular function in 3-week-old, 6-month-old, and 24-month-old mice that are heterozygous for a hypomorphic structural mutation of fibrillin-1 (Fbn1{+/mgΔ} mice) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that Fbn1{+/mgΔ} mice, particularly those that are 24 months old, are slightly more hypotensive than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> were more frequently observed in ageing Fbn1{+/mgΔ}$ mice than in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also noted substantial fragmentation and decreased number of elastic lamellae in the aortic wall of Fbn1{+/mgΔ} mice, which were correlated with an increase in aortic stiffness, a decrease in vasoreactivity, altered expression of elastic fibre-related genes, including fibrillin-1 and elastin, and a decrease in the relative ratio between tissue elastin and collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our findings suggest that the heterozygous mgΔ mutation accelerates some aspects of vascular ageing and eventually leads to aortic manifestations resembling those of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, our data also indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> in Fbn1{+/mgΔ} mice are opposite to those induced by elastin haploinsufficiency during ageing that affect blood pressure, vascular dimensions, and number of elastic lamellae </plain></SENT>
