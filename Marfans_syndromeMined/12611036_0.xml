<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These so-called remodelling and inclusion procedures provided hope for a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> life without long-term <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, with protection from the complication of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, a certain number of cases are encountered in which the Yacoub and David procedures cannot be performed because of the presence of a pseudo-bicuspid valve, isolated asymmetrical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the non-coronary sinus or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection of the aorta without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these forms, the authors have developed a technique of remodelling the aortic root with conservation of the native valve by resecting the ascending aorta and non-coronary sinus, rather than carrying out a Bentall procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine cases of this type have been treated in this way for three different indications: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> and extension to the posterior sinus, and type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection of the aorta </plain></SENT>
