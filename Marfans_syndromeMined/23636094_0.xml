<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite recent advances in understanding altered signaling in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, the underlying mechanisms and options for pharmacological treatment for other forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are still under investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously showed in mice that deficiency in the fibulin-4 gene in vascular SMCs (Fbln4(SMKO)) leads to loss of the SMC contractile phenotype, hyperproliferation, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report that abnormal up-regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in SMCs and subsequent activation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">AngII</z:chebi>) signaling are involved in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> in Fbln4(SMKO) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this model, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation was completely prevented by inhibition of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">AngII</z:chebi> pathway with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi> within a narrow therapeutic window during the first month of life, even though the altered mechanical properties of blood vessel walls were not reversed by the pharmacological treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> in Fbln4(SMKO) mice do not require the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">AngII</z:chebi> receptor type 2 (Agtr2) but likely require both type 1a (Agtr1a) and 1b (Agtr1b) receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that fibulin-4 is a vascular matrix component required for regulation of local angiotensin signaling and development and maintenance of the SMC phenotype </plain></SENT>
