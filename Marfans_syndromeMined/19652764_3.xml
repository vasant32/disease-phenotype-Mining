<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (AAD) is a life-threatening condition with high mortality and a relatively unclarified pathophysiological mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although differentially expressed genes in AAD have been recognized, interactions between these genes remain poorly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying AAD and to support the future development of a clinical test for monitoring patients at high risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Aortic tissue was collected from 19 patients with AAD (mean age 61.7 +/- 13.1 years), and from eight other patients (mean age 32.9 +/- 12.2 years) who carried the mutated gene for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six patients (mean age 56.7 +/- 12.3 years) served as the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The PIQOR(TM) Immunology microarray with 1076 probes in quadruplicates was utilized; the differentially expressed genes were analysed in a MedScan search using Pathway Assist software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and protein analysis were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Interactions of MS fibrillin-1 (FBN1) in the MedScan pathway analysis showed four genes, fibulin-1 (FBLN1), fibulin-2 (FBLN2), decorin (DCN) and microfibrillar associated protein 5 (MFAP5), which were differentially expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tissue from AAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The validation of these genes by qRT-PCR revealed a minimum of three-fold downregulation of FBLN1 (0.5 +/- 0.4 vs. 6.1 +/- 2.3 fold, p = 0.003) and of DCN (2.5 +/- 1.0 vs. 8.5 +/- 4.7 fold, p = 0.04) in AAD compared to MS and control samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Downregulation of fibrillin-1 (FBN1) may weaken extracellular components in the aorta and/or interfer with the transmission of cellular signals and eventually cause AAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additional research on these four identified genes can be a starting point to develop a diagnostic tool </plain></SENT>
