<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin-1 is a large modular <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> that assembles to form 10-12 nm microfibrils in the extracellular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> (fibrillinopathies) that show <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathogenic mechanism is thought to be a dominant negative effect of a mutant protein on microfibril assembly, although direct evidence is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant group of disease-causing FBN1 mutations are cysteine substitutions within EGF domains that are predicted to cause misfolding by removal of disulphide bonds that stabilize the native domain fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have studied three missense mutations (C1117Y, C1129Y and G1127S) to investigate the effect of misfolding on the trafficking of fibrillin-1 from fibroblast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that both C1117Y and C1129Y, expressed as recombinant fragments of fibrillin-1, are retained and accumulate within the cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both undergo core glycosylation but lack the complex glycosylation observed in the secreted <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> fragment, suggesting retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, co-immunoprecipitation experiments show association with the ER chaperone calreticulin, but not calnexin, 78 kDa <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-regulated protein (Grp78/BiP) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16249">protein disulfide</z:chebi> isomerase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, G1127S, which causes a moderate change in the EGF domain fold, shows a pattern of glycosylation and trafficking profile indistinguishable from the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since expression of the recombinant fragments does not disrupt the secretion of endogenous fibrillin-1 by the cell, we propose that G1127S causes disease via an extracellular dominant negative effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the observed ER retention of C1117Y and C1129Y suggests that disease associated with these missense mutations is caused either by an intracellular dominant negative effect or haploinsufficiency </plain></SENT>
