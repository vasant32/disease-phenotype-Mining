<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Bentall's operation, using a composite aortic valve and prosthetic graft. was performed in 82 patients (70 males) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indications for the procedure included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> (n=54 including 16 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>): DeBakey Type I or II <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (n=26 including 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> disease) (n=2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bentall's procedure with the inclusion technique was performed in 72 patients and a Cabrol <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> created in 63 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 10 other patients, coronary button transfer was done without a Cabrol <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 6 early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (7.3%) and 8 patients required re-exploration for excessive <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients showed low cardiac output while the wound of 8 became infected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> was seen in 26 and 6 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up ranged from 1 month to 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were 8 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, the causes of which include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (n=3). <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (n=3) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (n=2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients reported back with dissection of the descending thoracic aorta and await surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bentall's operation is a safe procedure with an acceptable mortality and morbidity </plain></SENT>
