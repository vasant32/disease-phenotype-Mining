<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutation analysis of the fibrillin I (FBN1) gene revealed a novel heterozygous frameshift mutation at the 3' end in that patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report on a 3.5-year-old girl with progeroid facial signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003623'>neonatal onset</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009125'>lipodystrophy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000256'>large head circumference</z:hpo> with corresponding <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephaly</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000098'>tall stature</z:hpo> at the end of infancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Her facial appearance showed convincing clinical similarities to the above-mentioned case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified a novel heterozygous de novo splice site mutation c.8226+1G&gt;T affecting the last intron of FBN1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We suggest a specific clinical entity characterized by progeroid facial features, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009125'>lipodystrophy</z:hpo>, and at least some clinical signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is associated with a subset of mutations located at the 3' end of FBN1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This phenotype which is different from that of classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> could be caused by a truncated FBN1 protein which could escape nonsense-mediated <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> decay </plain></SENT>
