<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations in major structural components of elastic fibres, especially elastin, fibrillins and fibulin-5, cause severe, often life-threatening, heritable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004381'>supravalvular aortic stenosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000973'>cutis laxa</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ability to regenerate or engineer elastic fibres and tissues remains a significant challenge, requiring improved understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of elastic-fibre biology and pathology, and ability to regulate the spatiotemporal expression and assembly of its molecular components </plain></SENT>
