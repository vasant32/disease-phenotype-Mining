<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Although, in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0001626'>cardiovascular abnormalities</z:hpo> are <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic valve regurgitation</z:hpo>, mitral valve dysfunction is the most frequently accompanying cardiac lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical course and management is reported of nine patients (seven men, two women; mean age 29.2 +/- 2.3 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who required different mitral valve procedures and aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>Mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> was caused by annulus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, by leaflet <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> in five patients, and by chordal rupture due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six patients underwent mitral valve replacement; three of these were operated on using preservation of the mitral valve apparatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients underwent mitral annuloplasty and chordal shortening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no hospital mortality, nor any valve-related complications in the series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The postoperative course was uneventful after each operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At a mean follow up of 4.5 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were in NYHA class I or II, with improved functional capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This experience in mitral valve procedures indicated that the connective tissue defect might compromise the results of such surgery, but that mitral valve operations could be performed satisfactorily in young <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> patients, despite complications of left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
