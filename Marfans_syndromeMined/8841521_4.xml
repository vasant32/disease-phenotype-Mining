<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Until recently, microfibrils, one component of the ECM, were thought primarily to serve as a scaffolding on which elastin is deposited during development to form elaunin fibres [1] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most prominent protein that forms mammalian microfibrils is fibrillin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is known that mutations in the fibrillin gene cause a heterogenous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disease</z:e> called <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> [2], so information on mechanical properties of microfibrils or their role in tissue function would be useful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microfibrils are also found in the ECM of some invertebrate tissues, and there is growing evidence that the protein forming the structure is homologous to mammalian fibrillin [3,4] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that the microfibril-based arterial wall of the lobster has viscoelastic properties [5], and we have now utilized this primitive artery to measure the modulus of elasticity of microfibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is similar to that of the rubber-like protein elastin </plain></SENT>
