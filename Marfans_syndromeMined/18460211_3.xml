<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To describe complications associated with Amplatzer septal occluders in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> CASE PRESENTATION: A nine-year-old boy with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and a 22 mm <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>) was treated successfully by interventional closure of his <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> by placing a 24 mm Amplatzer septal occluder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Follow up examinations showed a good result but an increasing enlargement of aortic root, so the patient was scheduled for operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative findings showed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> of the left atrial roof and the non-coronary sinus by penetration of the occluder device as well as penetration into the right atrial wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The occluder was resected, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> was closed and the aortic sinus was reconstructed using a Dacron patch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We describe the first case of a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and an interventional closure of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Due to alterations of the connective tissue, as it is typical for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, the Amplatzer occluder probably perforated adjacent structures more easily as in non-affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Amplatzer occluders should be used with caution and follow up examinations should be performed in short intervals </plain></SENT>
