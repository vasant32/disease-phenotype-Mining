<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between June 1985 and January 2010, 319 consecutive patients (mean age, 63 ± 11 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> underwent replacement of the ascending aorta with preservation of the aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aortic valve was also replaced in 21 of these patients (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The intervention was extended to the aortic arch in 210 patients (66%), of whom 173 (54%) underwent hemiarch replacement, and 37 (12%), total arch replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 109 (34%) in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 210 discharged patients, survival was 95%, 58%, and 27% at 1, 10, and 23 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Freedom from reoperation on the proximal aorta was reported by 97%, 92%, and 82% patients at 5, 10, and 23 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients were reoperated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> and 2 died during reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that significant risk factors for proximal reoperation were age &lt;60 years (P = .005; relative risk, 1.94) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (P = .011; relative risk, 2.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, 15 patients (11%) had an aortic root diameter of &gt;45 mm, but they were not reoperated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, replacement of the ascending aorta with root preservation shows long-term effectiveness with low reoperation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> rates </plain></SENT>
