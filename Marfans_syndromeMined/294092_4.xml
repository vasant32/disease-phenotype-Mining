<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cross-linkage of collagen appears to be more important than amount of collagen in permitting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001065'>striae</z:hpo> in response to stretch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An increase in cross linkage as in age increases the resistance to stretch deformation, but this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> leads ultimately to tearing of the skin and not <z:hpo ids='HP_0001065'>striae</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the other extreme, the absence of crosslinkage leads to "elasticity" and excessive stretching with eventual rupture of the skin if the stretch goes beyond the elastic limit, but again, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001065'>striae</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001065'>Striae</z:hpo> appear to occur therefore only in skin in which the rigid cross-linked collagen and "elastic" unlinked collagen thus permitting a limited degree of stretch and a limited intradermal rupture, i.e. <z:hpo ids='HP_0001065'>striae</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> and elasticity are presented here in terms of collagen cross-linkage it seems probable that changes in interfibrillary materials such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycans</z:chebi> will prove important in this respect) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This balance of stretch and limited tear is a continuous process and is an adaptation to the needs of growth in adolescence and change in body mass in early adult life and there are many many subclinical "<z:hpo ids='HP_0001065'>striae</z:hpo>" for each gross tear which is recognised clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An important factor likewise appears to be rate of stretch since if it is very slow, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001065'>striae</z:hpo> are less likely; there is "give" and new collagen formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although this working hypothesis is consonant with the facts only further work will show whether this smooth consonance is that of the fable or the weathered rock of fact </plain></SENT>
