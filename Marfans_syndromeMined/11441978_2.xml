<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is to be stressed that the vascular component of hemostasis is often overlooked by clinicians caring for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disorders of hemostasis</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It should be appreciated that the vasculature is intricately related to the coagulation protein system and to platelets when involved in thrombohemorrhagic diatheses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disorders</z:e> may lead to <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, it must be appreciated that often it is impossible to discern between a primary vascular defect/damage and a defect that has been induced by platelet activation/dysfunction or procoagulant abnormalities </plain></SENT>
