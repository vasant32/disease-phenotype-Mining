<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Atypical patterns lacking an intimal flap can occur, however, and are less well recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the authors review their experience with atypical patterns at magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They evaluated the T1-weighted and gradient-echo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images of the entire aorta in 64 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In nine patients (14%) aortic wall thickening was the only sign of dissection in the thorax </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In three of these cases, an intimal flap was found in the abdominal aorta; the other six patients had no flap in any region of the aorta, and this led to false-negative angiographic results in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aortic wall thickening as an atypical sign of dissection was seen more frequently in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (29%) than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (7%) dissection and was seen in only patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients with atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection at initial examination developed a clearly identifiable intimal flap at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aortic wall thickening may represent the only sign of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In some cases, imaging the entire aorta can enable recognition of dissection in atypical cases </plain></SENT>
