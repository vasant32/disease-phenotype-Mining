<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the group with dissection of the ascending aorta, 58.6% of patients given medical therapy and 48.8% of patients given surgical therapy died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the group with dissection of the descending aorta, 14.0% given medical therapy and 50.0% given surgical therapy died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High mortality in the medical group with type A dissection was caused by delayed operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Better survival was achieved in treated than surgically treated patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> distal dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac tamponade</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012151'>hemothorax</z:hpo>/<z:chebi fb="5" ids="24480">hemo</z:chebi>-mediastinum, visceral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and peripheral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, mortalities following medical treatment were fairly high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatment brought on improvement in mortality in these groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in the cases complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo>, the mortality in the surgical group was higher than that in the medical group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>42 patients (28.8%) had no evidence of any complication and only 6 (14.3%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 20 cases (47.6%) of uncomplicated dissection, no blood flow was observed in the false lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In cases with open false lumen, the following abnormal findings were more conspicuous: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, decreased level of fibrinogen, increased fibrin degradation product and soluble fibrin monomer complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, these changes seem to be minimal in cases with thrombosed false lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The measurement of coagulation factors may be one useful method to determine which therapeutic procedure is most suitable </plain></SENT>
