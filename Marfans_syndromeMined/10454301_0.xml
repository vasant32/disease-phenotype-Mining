<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 97 patients discharged from the hospital were included in the present analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The age of the patients ranged from 25 to 73 years with a mean of 50+/-10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound examination of carotid arteries was performed with the patient lying on his back using a Toshiba 340A color Doppler system with a linear array probe of 7.5 MHz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 97 patients examined, 15 (15%) had a dissection of at least one of the common carotid arteries (CCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 11 patients the dissection involved the right common carotid artery and in four it involved both the left and right common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The flow in the true lumen of CCA and ICA was preserved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and the degree of narrowing ranged from 30 to -70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only one of the 15 patients with CCA dissection had an ipsilateral neurological deficit which was already present before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound follow-up was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with the CCA dissection found on first examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of follow-up was 21 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 14 patients the degree and extent of the dissection as well as the narrowing of the true lumen was comparable, and in one patient the false channel closed spontaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>During follow-up there were no new major neurological events despite the persistence of the CCA dissection with different degrees of narrowing of the true lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Doppler ultrasound examination of the carotid arteries can supply additional information about the extent of the dissection, and help to assess the flow in the persisting 'double channel' common carotid artery during the follow-up of patients </plain></SENT>
