<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is no three-dimensional analysis of the deformity in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine what kind of sagittal balance defines <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, namely a flexion deformity, as it is in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> associated with Chiari I or an extension deformity, as in adolescent idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> (AIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To address this issue, we compared the presence or absence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002943'>thoracic scoliosis</z:hpo> with the presence or absence of a segment in extension in the thoracic spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In our series, 30 patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> were prospectively included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In each patient, personalized three-dimensional reconstruction from T1 to L5 of the spine was made using stereoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients were first separated based on the presence or absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002943'>thoracic scoliosis</z:hpo>, in order to compare this with the presence or absence of a segment in extension in the thoracic spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They were then classified into two groups based on the presence or absence of the segment in extension (meaning containing negative values of inter-vertebral sagittal rotation) in the thoracic spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among scoliotic patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002943'>thoracic scoliosis</z:hpo> (17 cases), there were 13 (76.5% cases) with a segment in extension in the thoracic spine and 4 with no segment in extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> is somehow original, demonstrating a sagittal balance in extension (as AIS) in about 80% of thoracic curves, but without this characteristic feature in about 20% </plain></SENT>
