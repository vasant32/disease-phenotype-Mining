<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0005111'>dilatation of the ascending aorta</z:hpo> (about 7.5 cm at the proximal portion) and aortic annulus, an intimal flap in the ascending aorta and aortic arch was also noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiac catheterization revealed the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 33 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure was 47/38 mmHg with a mean of 35.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cardiac index was 1.01 l/min/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Poor left ventricular contractility was shown by a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 13.8% and a right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) of 5.13% by a radionuclide angiogram (<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Under the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002622'>dissecting aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta and aortic arch, he was put on a waiting list for heart transplantation </plain></SENT>
