<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between April, 1977 and April, 1985, seventeen patients underwent repair of annulo-aortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> (9 cases), and dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> (8 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac tamponade</z:e> due to rupture of dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In regard to this procedure, we recently performed the continuous suture method on the prosthetic valve ring, coronary ostia, and distal anastomosis sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, there was one early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to a sudden rupture of the dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the left thoracic cavity on the 10th postoperative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, there were two late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The late follow-up period ranged from 6 months to 8 years (mean 35 months), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were in NYHA Class I or II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the composite valve graft method is an excellent technique for annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004933'>ascending aortic dissections</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> because of its low operative mortality and fair survival rate </plain></SENT>
