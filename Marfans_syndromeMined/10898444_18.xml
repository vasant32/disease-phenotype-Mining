<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001643'>Ductus arteriosus</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is a rare lesion that can be associated with severe complications including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, rupture and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We reviewed the clinical records, diagnostic imaging studies and available histology of 24 cases of DAA, diagnosed postnatally (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) in 15 and antenatally (AD) in 9 encountered in five institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> cases, 13 presented at &lt;2 months, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> AD cases were detected incidentally after 33 weeks of gestation during a late trimester fetal ultrasound study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 24, only 4 had DAA-related symptoms and 6 had associated syndromes: Marfan, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175694" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="SLOS">Smith-Lemli-Opitz</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomies</z:mp> 21 and 13 and one possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three had complications related to the DAA: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> extension into the pulmonary artery, spontaneous rupture, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142514" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">asymptomatic cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six underwent uncomplicated DAA resection for ductal patency, DAA size or extension of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the four examined, there was histologic evidence of reduced intimal cushions in two and abnormal elastin expression in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five of the 24 died, with only one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to DAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 19 survivors, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one remain clinically asymptomatic at a median follow-up of 35 months; however, two have developed other cardiac lesions that suggest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A review of 200 consecutive third trimester fetal ultrasounds suggests an incidence of DAA of 1.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001643'>Ductus arteriosus</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> likely develops in the third trimester perhaps due to abnormal intimal cushion formation or elastin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although it can be associated with syndromes and severe complications, many affected infants have a benign course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Given the potential for development of other cardiac lesions associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disease</z:e>, follow-up is warranted </plain></SENT>
