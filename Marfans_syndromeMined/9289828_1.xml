<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the high quality of medical care in this country, the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> will be delayed in a majority of the cases even if the patient has already been treated for one of the aspects of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indications for surgery have recently been simplified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regarding aortic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral valve regurgitation</z:hpo>, the indications for surgical repair are similar to those of non-Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aortic root and ascending aorta should be replaced when the diameter reaches 50 to 55 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In children and adolescents, surgery is considered indicated when the diameter of the diseased aortic segment is more than twice the diameter of the normally expected aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This review presents a single center experience in the surgical treatment of cardiovascular manifestations associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and summarizes some interesting cases treated in the recent past </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite the progress made in the fields of surgery, anesthesiology, intensive care and cardiology, the mortality of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> surgery because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> remains about 10% whereas elective surgery can be performed with a perioperative risk of around 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Even if composite graft replacement gives excellent long-term results, some alternatives to this technique should be considered, especially in patients in whom anticoagulation with cumadines is not recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More recently, a Working group for Adult and Teenager <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>Congenital Heart Disease</z:hpo> (WATCH) has been established within the Swiss Society of Cardiology, with the aim of optimizing the management of grown-up patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart defects</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> was included in the recommendations of this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Follow-up before or after surgery is recommended at yearly (or half-yearly) intervals and should include echocardiography and/or computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Finally, the patient and his family should be informed about the prognosis of the disease, the technical options in the treatment of cardiovascular manifestations, and the possibility of assistance from the Marfan Foundation </plain></SENT>
