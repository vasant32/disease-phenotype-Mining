<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Access to left free-wall atrioventricular accessory pathways can be obtained either via retrograde cardiac catheterization or via the transseptal procedure, which allows ablation of the accessory pathway at its ventricular or atrial insertion, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001716'>Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome</z:hpo> in whom coronary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> occurred as a complication of transseptal percutaneous radiofrequency catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was made by two-dimensional echocardiography showing a marked echocontrast effect in the posterior wall and in the posterior half of the interventricular septum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A grossly evident breakage of the rubber seal of the vascular sheath was supposed to be the cause of air insinuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This report suggests that the transseptal approach should be used with caution in performing percutaneous radiofrequency catheter ablation to avoid the risk of air embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional echocardiography is an ideal tool to detect this complication </plain></SENT>
