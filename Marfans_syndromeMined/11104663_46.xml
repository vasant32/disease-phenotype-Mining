<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) cytokines are a multi-functional family that exert a wide variety of effects on both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and transformed mammalian cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The secretion and activation of TGFbetas is regulated by their association with latency-associated proteins and latent TGFbeta binding proteins (LTBPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over the past few years, three members of the LTBP family have been identified, in addition to the protoype LTBP1 first sequenced in 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three of the LTBP family are expressed in a variety of isoforms as a consequence of alternative splicing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review summarizes the differences between the isoforms in terms of the effects on domain structure and hence possible function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The close identity between LTBPs and members of the fibrillin family, mutations in which have been linked directly to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, suggests that anomalous expression of LTBPs may be associated with disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recent data indicating that differential expression of LTBP1 isoforms occurs during the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> is considered, together with evidence that modulation of LTBP function, and hence of TGFbeta activity, is associated with a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
