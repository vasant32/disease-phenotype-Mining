<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In such cases, despite meticulous exploration an underlying pathology cannot be revealed and most reports in the world literature relate spontaneous colon ruptures with unusual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> such as Marfan or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Connective tissue diseases</z:e> affect the structure and the synthesis of elastin and type III collagen, resulting in various systemic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the several pulmonary manifestations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002108'>spontaneous pneumothorax</z:hpo> is observed in about 5% of patients expressing one of the above syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: In the following report we present a unique case of spontaneous rupture of the sigmoid colon secondary to spontaneous recurrent contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The aim of this presentation is to raise the level of suspicion in every surgeon and gastroenterologist to include <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> in their differential diagnosis in any case of spontaneous colon rupture and, if found, to follow further diagnostic procedures in anticipation of any other visceral complications </plain></SENT>
