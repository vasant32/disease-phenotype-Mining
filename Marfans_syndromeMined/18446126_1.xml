<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationship between pregnancy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe the cases of two women with no history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> who developed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> aortic type A dissection within a few days after term delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgical repair was performed with ascending aorta replacement and aortic valve sparing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both cases, the dissection was diagnosed within a few days following cesarean section done neither because of fetal or maternal distress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To date, only one case of type A and two cases of type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> following cesarean section have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with spontaneous delivery, scheduled cesarean section, as in our cases, allows for better control of hemodynamic parameters and should protect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperative screening for inherent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> detected no mutations within the fibrillin and collagen gene chromosome in either patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and the patients were discharged on postoperative days 7 and 8, respectively </plain></SENT>
