<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: In this review, we focus on the impact of the revised <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> clinical diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We discuss lessons that have been learned from molecular findings in relevant Marfan-related conditions, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo>/dissection, stiff skin syndrome, acromelic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> and Loeys-Dietz syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We explore the latest insights into the role of the alternative TGF-β signaling pathways in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, we give an update on the current and future treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: The recent insights into the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and related disorders have offered a prime example of translational medicine with immediate bridge between molecular findings and therapeutic options </plain></SENT>
