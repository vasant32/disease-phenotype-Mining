<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, molecular analyses could also be used for preimplantation genetic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The identification of a mutation allows for early diagnosis, prognosis, genetic counseling, preventive management of carriers and reassurance for unaffected relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The importance of knowing in advance the location of the putative family mutation is highlighted by its straightforward application to prenatal and postnatal screening </plain></SENT>
