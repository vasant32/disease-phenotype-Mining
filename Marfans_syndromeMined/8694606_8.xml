<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study was done to answer the question, "What is the current risk of resection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> regardless of acuity or cause?" METHODS: One hundred fifteen consecutive patients who underwent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> repair from January 1, 1990, to July 1, 1995, were retrospectively reviewed, excluding those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004933'>ascending aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 59 years; 55% were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Concomitant procedures included coronary artery bypass in 23 (20%) and arch repair in 12 (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In group 1, 54 patients had replacement of the aortic valve, root, and ascending aorta with a valve-graft conduit using the "Bentall" technique, and of these 19 (35%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In group II, 44 patients had separate aortic valve repair or replacement and supracoronary ascending aortic replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In group III, 17 patients had supracoronary ascending aortic replacement, without aortic valve operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Operative techniques included frequent use of (1) intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography or epiaortic ultrasound scanning of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta to help guide arterial cannulation, avoid atherosclerotic embolization, and assess the repair; (2) antegrade and retrograde multidose cold blood cardioplegia for myocardial protection; (3) exclusion and button anastomotic techniques to ensure secure suture lines; (4) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48675">antifibrinolytic agents</z:chebi> and collagen-impregnated aortic grafts to reduce <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>; and (5) deep hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> and the open distal anastomotic technique in patients with distal ascending and arch <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Operative mortality overall was 2/115 (1.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mortality was 1/54 (1.8) in group I and 1/44 (2%) in group II, and there was no mortality in group III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall postoperative morbidity was 3% due to <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, 2% due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and 1% due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The length of stay in the past year has decreased to less than 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> repair is low (&lt; 2%) whether or not the aortic root or valve also needs repair, regardless of the cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
