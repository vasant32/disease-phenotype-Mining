<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between 1997 and 2009, 56 children (mean age 11.5 years) underwent VSRR at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six (46.4%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and 24 (42.8%) had Loeys-Dietz syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean preoperative max sinus diameter was 4.2±0.8 cm (Z-score 7.7±2.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five (8.9%) had &gt;2+ <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> (AI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two (3.6%) underwent David I reimplantation with a straight-tube, 12 (21.4%) had a Yacoub remodeling procedure, and 42 (75.0%) had reimplantation using a Valsalva-graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were one (1.8%) operative and three (5.4%) late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient required reoperation for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and one required late repair of a distal pseudoaneurysm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 5.2 years (range 0-12 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patients suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> or had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 12 remodeling patients, four (33.3%) developed &gt;2+ AI and required aortic valve repair or replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No patient developed &gt;2+ AI after reimplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>VSRR in children is a safe alternative to aortic root replacement with mechanical or biological prostheses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In this particular group of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> and proclivity toward annular dilation and late AI, reimplantation is superior to remodeling </plain></SENT>
