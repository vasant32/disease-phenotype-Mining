<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that TGF-beta and Wnt stimulate fibrillin-1 assembly and that fibrillin-1 and the developmental regulator CCN3 are both highly increased in Tsk skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of CCN3 in abnormal fibrillinogenesis in Tsk mice, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, and SSc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Smad3 deletion in Tsk mice decreased CCN3 overexpression, suggesting that TGF-beta mediates at least part of the effect of Tsk fibrillin on CCN3 which is consistent with a synergistic effect of TGF-beta and Wnt in vitro on CCN3 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disruption of fibrillin-1 assembly by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> fibrillin decreased CCN3 expression and skin from patients with early diffuse SSc showed a strong correlation between increased CCN3 and fibrillin-1 expression, suggesting that CCN3 regulation by fibrillin-1 extends to these CTDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diffuse SSc skin and sera also showed evidence of increased Wnt activity, implicating a Wnt stimulus behind this correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CCN3 overexpression markedly repressed fibrillin-1 assembly and also blocked other TGFbeta- and Wnt-regulated profibrotic gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Together, these data indicate that CCN3 counter-regulates positive signals from TGF-beta and Wnt for fibrillin fibrillogenesis and profibrotic gene expression </plain></SENT>
