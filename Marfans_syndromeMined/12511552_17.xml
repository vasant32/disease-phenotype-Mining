<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations within the fibrillin-1 gene cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>), a heritable disease of connective tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More than 60% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>-causing mutations identified are localized to cbEGFs, emphasizing that the native properties of these domains are critical for fibrillin-1 function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cbEGF12-13 domain pair is within the longest run of cbEGFs, and many mutations that cluster in this region are associated with severe, neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The NMR solution structure of Ca(2+)-loaded cbEGF12-13 exhibits a near-linear, rod-like arrangement of domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This observation supports the hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fibrillin-1 (cb)EGF-cbEGF pairs, characterized by a single interdomain linker residue, possess this rod-like structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The domain arrangement of cbEGF12-13 is stabilized by additional interdomain packing interactions to those observed for cbEGF32-33, which may help to explain the previously reported higher calcium binding affinity of cbEGF13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on this structure, a model of cbEGF11-15 that encompasses <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> missense mutations has highlighted a potential binding region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Backbone dynamics data confirm the extended structure of cbEGF12-13 and lend support to the hypothesis that a correlation exists between backbone flexibility and cbEGF domain calcium affinity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results provide important insight into the potential consequences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>-associated mutations for the assembly and biomechanical properties of connective tissue microfibrils </plain></SENT>
