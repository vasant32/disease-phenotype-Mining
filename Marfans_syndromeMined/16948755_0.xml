<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1985 and December 2004, 49 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> were operated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these 49 patients, 9 (18,4%) required &gt; or =1 reoperations after a mean duration of 32.2 +/- 26.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of follow-up was 52.0 +/- 46.8 months, a total of 39 patient/years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival free of reoperation was calculated by Cox regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Surgical indication for operation was a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> aneurysmal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the ascending or abdominal aorta in seven patients (77.8%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in two (22.2%) at the initial operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the reoperations, repair of thoracoabdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> with separated graft interposition in six patients (66.7%), replacement of ascending aorta in one (11.1%), replacement of ascending and hemiarchus aorta in one (11.1%), and mitral valve replacement in three patients (33.3%) were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hospital mortality was 11.1% with one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the survivors, one expired in the follow-up five months after the second operation (12.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With the Cox regression analysis, survival without reoperation for 13, 24, and 123 months are 95.56 +/- 3.04%, 90.66 +/- 4.40%, and 60.32 +/- 12.63%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean survival for reoperated patients is 99 +/- 14 months (95% confidence interval 72-127 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reoperations can be done with low morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients should be kept under close follow-up using imaging techniques infinitely </plain></SENT>
