<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>Mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> is the most common outcome of these and remains one of the most common indications for valvular surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While the etiology of the disease is unknown, recent genetic studies have demonstrated that an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> form of familial cardiac valvular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> can be attributed to mutations in the Filamin-A gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since these inheritable mutations are present from conception, we hypothesize that filamin-A mutations present at the time of valve morphogenesis lead to dysfunction that progresses postnatally to clinically relevant disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, by carefully evaluating genetic factors (such as filamin-A) that play a substantial role in MVP, we can elucidate relevant developmental pathways that contribute to its pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In order to understand how developmental expression of a mutant protein can lead to valve disease, the spatio-temporal distribution of filamin-A during cardiac morphogenesis must first be characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although previously thought of as a ubiquitously expressed gene, we demonstrate that filamin-A is robustly expressed in non-myocyte cells throughout cardiac morphogenesis including epicardial and endocardial cells, and mesenchymal cells derived by EMT from these two epithelia, as well as mesenchyme of neural crest origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In postnatal hearts, expression of filamin-A is significantly decreased in the atrioventricular and outflow tract valve leaflets and their suspensory apparatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Characterization of the temporal and spatial expression pattern of filamin-A during cardiac morphogenesis is a crucial first step in our understanding of how mutations in filamin-A result in clinically relevant valve disease </plain></SENT>
