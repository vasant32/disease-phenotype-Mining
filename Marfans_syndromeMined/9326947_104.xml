<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The vascular phenotype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> results from mutations in fibrillin-1 (FBN1), the major constituent of extracellular microfibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microfibrils, either associated with or devoid of elastin, give rise to a variety of extracellular networks in elastic and non-elastic tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is believed that microfibrils regulate elastic fibre formation by guiding tropo-elastin deposition during embryogenesis and early post-natal life </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we report a gene-targetting experiment in mice that indicates that fibrillin-1 microfibrils are predominantly engaged in tissue homeostasis rather than elastic matrix assembly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding, in turn, suggests that <z:mp ids='MP_0010574'>aortic dilation</z:mp> is due primarily to the failure by the microfibrillar array of the adventitia to sustain physiological haemodynamic stress, and that disruption of the elastic network of the media is a secondary event </plain></SENT>
