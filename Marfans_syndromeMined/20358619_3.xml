<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients have craniofacial and skeletal features that overlap with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>), and more importantly, have significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular fragility</z:e> as is seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268338" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="EDS4">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Type IV</z:e> (EDS-IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The skeletal phenotype with respect to low bone mineral density and skeletal fragility is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present two patients with LDS with significant skeletal fragility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first is a 17-year-old male who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001762'>talipes equinovarus</z:hpo>, diaphragmatic and inguinal and herniae, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> necessitating surgical repair, craniofacial and skeletal dysmorphism consistent with LDS, and a history of numerous fragility fractures leading to significant skeletal deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He was found to be heterozygous for a c.923T &gt; C transition in exon 4 of TGFBR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second is a 26-year-old male with submucous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001762'>talipes equinovarus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> requiring surgery, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000023'>inguinal hernia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in the ascending aorta, abdominal aorta, carotid, subclavian, vertebral and brachial arteries requiring surgical repairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>He also had craniofacial and skeletal dysmorphism consistent with LDS, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002757'>multiple fractures</z:hpo> in childhood, low bone mineral density, and was found to be heterozygous for a c.1561 T &gt; C transition in exon 7 of TGFBR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These case studies highlight the importance of paying close attention to fractures and bone density in patients with LDS </plain></SENT>
