<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The curve patterns were double major right thoracic-left lumbar in 48 per cent and single right thoracic in 33 per cent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the start of treatment the curves were severe (average, 72 degrees) and quite structural (average bending correction, 36 per cent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-four per cent of the thirty-five patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inadequately treated and untreated curves usually progressed to severe and painful deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Milwaukee brace treatment was generally unsuccessful because of the severity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> of the curves or the poor maintenance of correction obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spine fusion combined with Harrington rod instrumentation (fourteen patients) gave an average correction of 41 per cent with an average loss of 7 degrees (average follow-up, 2.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Operative treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> is indicated in most patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
