<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two aetiological factors are essential: acquired or congenital fragility of the aortic elastic tissue, and arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The condition must be diagnosed as early as possible to avoid a fatal outcome: it is a surgical emergency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical diagnosis rests on a history of migrating pain and on the presence of signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> in a vascular territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is confirmed by complementary investigations, chiefly angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> dissection of the ascending aorta is treated by surgery: the ascending segment is resected, the distal cylindres are recoupled to close the portal of entry, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> is treated by valvuloplasty or aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The introduction of the GRF biological glue has considerably improved the per-operative prognosis and lowered the hospital mortality to 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Long-term post-operative follow-up of the patient is crucial, since iterative dissection and formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are not exceptional, especially in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
