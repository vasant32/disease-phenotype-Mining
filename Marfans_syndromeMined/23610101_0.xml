<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Aortic arch surgery following previous replacement of the ascending aorta has become more frequent due to the improved long-term survival of patients after the primary procedure and advances in the management of complex repeat cardiac procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analysed our results of redo aortic arch surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 1995 and December 2011, a total of 1022 patients underwent surgery on the ascending aorta with or without involvement of the aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 57 patients (5%) underwent reoperations involving the aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indications for repeat aortic arch surgery included arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in 50%, residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> with aneurysmal formation in 38%, and graft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in 9% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient (1%) underwent previous heart transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (16%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age was 55 ± 15 years and 23 patients (40%) were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Logistic EuroSCORE-predicted risk of mortality was 38 ± 19% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean time interval between primary and redo surgery was 7.6 ± 7 years for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> and 4.4 ± 4 years in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> patients (P = 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Total and partial arch replacements were performed in 52 and 47% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> time was 28.3 ± 22.1 min, with selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (SACP) utilized in 68% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or transient neurological deficit was 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The 30-day mortality was 9% (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that previous type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> was the only independent risk factor (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.5-5.5, P = 0.01) for 30-day mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Mean survival was 5.5 ± 0.5 years, and estimated 5-year survival was 74.9 ± 0.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Survival of patients undergoing reoperation for residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> was significantly worse compared with patients with aortic arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (log-rank P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aortic arch reoperation, although a technically complex operation, can be performed with acceptable mortality and morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> during their previous operation required repeat surgery significantly earlier when compared with patients with arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and had worse long-term survival </plain></SENT>
