<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>Aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> secondary to degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta can be surgically treated with replacement of the valve or with remodeling of the aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 15 patients who underwent aortic root remodeling from January 1994 to December 1996, we evaluated the postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> and correlated it with several anatomic and functional variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Operative success was defined as a residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> less than or equal to 1 on a scale of 0 to 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Root dimensions and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003504" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ai">aortic incompetence</z:e> decreased significantly after the operation (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference between preoperative and postoperative root diameters (p = 0.0006) and the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (p &lt; 0.0001) were independently predictive of persisting significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Operative success was obtained in patients with a difference between preoperative and postoperative root diameters smaller than 30 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aortic root remodeling is effective in reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> may result in excessive geometric alteration, leading to suboptimal results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The choice of a larger graft contributes to avoiding excessive geometric constraint of a profoundly diseased aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Indication to undergo root remodeling should be evaluated cautiously in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
