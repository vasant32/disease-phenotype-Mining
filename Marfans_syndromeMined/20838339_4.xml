<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi>) dissection is an important cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the western world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Especially in young adults, the genetic contribution to this disease is estimated to be high, as at least one out of five probands has a positive family history for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo>/dissections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In recent years, major progress has been made in the identification of several genes underlying both syndromic and nonsyndromic forms of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: This review will focus on the current knowledge of a recently discovered syndromic form of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi>, namely the Loeys-Dietz syndrome or LDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: LDS is caused by mutation in the genes encoding the transforming growth factor beta receptor 1 and 2 (TGFBR1 and TGFRB2) and is characterized by aggressive aortic/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical characteristics, molecular findings and pathophysiological mechanisms are summarized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The discovery of this entity has confirmed a key role for transforming growth factor beta signaling in aortic aneurysmal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Study of the natural history of this condition has revealed important lessons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> is widespread and can involve <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aortic segments and major branching arteries, necessitating cardiovascular imaging beyond the aortic root segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, dissections occur at smaller diameters than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, leading to earlier surgery at smaller aortic diameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Current surgical experience with LDS is excellent, offering a good long-term prognosis with timely identification of the disease </plain></SENT>
