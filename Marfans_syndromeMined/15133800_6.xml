<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Celocentesis is the ultrasound-guided <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> of fluid from the extra-amniotic cavity at 7-8 weeks of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper reports on the clinical application of celocentesis for early prenatal diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Celocentesis was successfully performed in nine pregnancies and 1-2 mL of fluid were obtained after one needle insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The indications were prenatal diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005283" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">beta-thalassemia</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> (n = 6), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (n = 1) and paternity testing (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular biological techniques were used to analyze the celomic fluid and this was successfully carried out in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In two cases pregnancy termination was performed at the request of the mother because in one case the fetus was found to have sickle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and in the second case paternity testing demonstrated that the father was not the woman's husband </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both cases the results were confirmed using the placental samples collected after pregnancy termination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In six of the seven pregnancies with desirable results, amniocentesis was performed at 16 weeks and the results were concordant with those obtained from celocentesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> pregnancies were uneventful and resulted in the delivery of healthy and appropriately grown babies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Celocentesis may be a viable alternative to the currently used tests of chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis </plain></SENT>
