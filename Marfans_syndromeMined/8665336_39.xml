<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight consecutive fatal cases which occurred in women aged 34-54 years (mean 43) are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dissection involved the left anterior descending coronary artery in four, the left main trunk in two, the right coronary artery in one, and both left anterior descending and circumflex arteries in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentation was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in six cases, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was made at necropsy in every case but one, in which coronary dissection was diagnosed during life by selective coronary angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The only ascertained risk factor was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in one patient; none of the women was in the puerperium, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> was excluded in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histology showed a haematoma between the coronary tunica media and adventitia, that flattened and occluded the lumen; a coronary intimal tear was detected in only two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unusual histological findings were cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in one case, eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrates in four, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002992,C1411989" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">angiomatosis</z:e> of the tunica adventitia in one </plain></SENT>
