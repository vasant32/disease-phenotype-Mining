<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> is caused by mutation in the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1; OMIM#134797) and more than 550 mutations have been identified so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FBN1 is approximately 230 kb in size and contains three evolutionarily conserved alternatively spliced exons B, A and C at the 5'end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a first systematic attempt to associate sequence variations in the FBN1 5' alternatively spliced exons with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, we investigated 41 individuals fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of Ghent nosology or with features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> including at least one major criterion or involvement of two organ systems but not fulfilling a strict interpretation of the Ghent nosology, and known to be negative for mutations in the FBN1 exons 1-65 as well as the TGFBR2 and TGFBR1 coding regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified five novel and one previously reported variants in the six unrelated probands and provide preliminary evidence for their role in pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
