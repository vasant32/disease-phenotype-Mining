<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 31 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> who were operated on between 1980 and 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic dissection</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 14 patients, DeBakey Type I in six patients and Type II in eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four patients had to be operated urgently in cardiogenic shock with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac tamponade</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sealing up and reinforcement with strip of felt or Gore-Tex has been applied in 22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The surgical modifications mentioned above have been applied since 1987 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with the diameter of the aortic ring exceeding 30 mm or with active infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> or during reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 16 patients the space between the aortic homograft and patients own aortic wall was joined to the right atrial auricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up for 12-179 months (average: 94.6 +/- 499) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients died in the early postoperative period and four patients died in the late postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rethoracotomy because of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications was necessary in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HAG damage was responsible for six other reoperations-new HAGs have been implanted in three patients and artificial prostheses were implanted in the other three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the late follow-up period significant improvement in cardiac performance was observed in 24 patients (NYHA I or II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Survival probability of 15 years for the whole group was 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The lowest survival probability has been shown in the group of patients with DeBakey Type I <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (35% survived 15 years after operation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic follow-up has shown that the pressure gradient in HAG was low (7.4 +/- 6.2 mmHg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Only in two patients did the HAG gradient exceeded 20 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences concerning aortic ring diameters, dimensions of HAG and echocardiographic parameters between the group with surgical modifications, i.e. sealing up and reinforcement with strip of felt or Gore-Tex applied and the group in which these modifications were not applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Homogenic aortic graft implantation as a method of surgical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> avoids postoperative anticoagulation, results in substantial improvement of cardiac performance and prolongs life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatment should be considered in asymptomatic patients with large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (exceeding 55-65 mm) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> because there is a high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in this group of patients in the case of dissection </plain></SENT>
