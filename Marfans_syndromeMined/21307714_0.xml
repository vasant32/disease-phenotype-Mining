<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1321551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome</z:e> (SGS) is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001519'>marfanoid habitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical findings of SGS include neurological, cardiovascular, connective tissue, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>skeletal abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among these skeletal findings, developmental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> is recognized in half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with SGS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, no earlier reports have described the surgical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> associated with SGS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four patients (2 boys and 2 girls; mean age at the time of surgery, 7.3±4.4 y) with SGS who underwent surgical treatment for progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The radiologic findings, operative findings, and perioperative complications were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean preoperative Cobb angle was 102.8±16.9 degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The curve patterns were a double curve in 2 cases and a triple curve in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Local <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> at the thoracolumbar area was recognized in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases with a mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> angle of 49±16 degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Growing rod procedures were performed in 2 patients, and posterior correction and fusion were performed in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean correction rate was 45% in the patients who underwent the growing rod procedures at the time of growing rod placement and 51% in the patients who underwent posterior correction and fusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Dislodgement of the proximal anchors occurred in 3 of the 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0005864'>pseudoarthrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed deep wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, and implant removal was necessary in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> in patients with SGS was associated with a high incidence of perioperative and postoperative complications including implant dislodgements and deep wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> attributable to poor bone quality and a thin body habitus, which are characteristic clinical features of this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Careful preoperative surgical planning and postoperative care are critical for the surgical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> associated with SGS, especially in infants requiring multiple surgeries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV </plain></SENT>
