<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify genes that might participate in epistatic interactions with FBN1, and could therefore explain the observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>phenotypic variability</z:hpo>, we have looked for genes that are co-expressed with Fbn1 in the mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microarray expression data derived from a range of primary mouse cells and cell lines were analysed using the network analysis tool BioLayout Express(3D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A cluster of 205 genes, including Fbn1, were selectively expressed by mouse cell lines of different mesenchymal lineages and by mouse primary mesenchymal cells (preadipocytes, myoblasts, fibroblasts, osteoblasts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Promoter analysis of this gene set identified several candidate transcriptional regulators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genes within this co-expressed cluster are candidate genetic modifiers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0810058" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">other connective tissue diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
