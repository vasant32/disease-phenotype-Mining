<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the one hundred and forty-four first-degree relatives, 117 of whom were living, eighty-four were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five were found to be affected by the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six were females and nine were males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Auscultatory and phonocardiographic findings consisted either of isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">mis</z:e>-systolic clicks or systolic murmurs or a combination of the two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiograms revealed changes of various types, most commonly of the ST-T segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>About seventy per cent of the patients were symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine members, not examined by the authors, had died suddenly; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had a previous history of "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopathy</z:e>" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Progressivity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264765,C0026265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral valve disease</z:e> with age is not confirmed by the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> of the defect might be that of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> form of Mendelian type with delayed expression of the defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An alternatove hypothesis of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001426'>multifactorial inheritance</z:hpo> mechanism, which is more stimulating for future studies on the cause of the syndrome, is also taken into consideration </plain></SENT>
