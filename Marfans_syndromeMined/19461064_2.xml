<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>Dural ectasia</z:hpo> (DE) is one of the major criteria of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to establish the prevalence of DE in an adult population fulfilling the Ghent criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and to assess definitions of DE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred five adults with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging at 1.5T was performed unless contraindicated; then CT was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lumbosacral anteroposterior vertebral body diameters (VBD) and dural sac diameters (DSD) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dural sac ratios (DSR = DSD/VBD) at levels L3 through S1 were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0002435'>meningoceles</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniations</z:e> of nerve root sleeves, and scalloping were characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One hundred one sex- and age-matched patients were included as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 3 patient groups: 1) fulfilling Ghent criteria independent of DE (n = 73), 2); fulfilling Ghent criteria dependent on DE (n = 14), and 3); and suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, not fulfilling Ghent criteria (n = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DE was found in 86% of group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At levels L4-S1, mean DSRs were significantly higher in group 1 than in group 3 and controls (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Herniations</z:e> of the nerve root sleeves were present in 73% in group 1 versus 1% in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Anterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0002435'>meningoceles</z:hpo> were found in 37% and 14% in groups 1 and 2, respectively, but not in group 3 or controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of DE on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging or CT should be based on the presence of at least 1 of the following criteria: anterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0002435'>meningoceles</z:hpo> or nerve root sleeve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e>, DSD at S1 or below larger than DSD at L4, and DSR at S1 &gt;0.59 </plain></SENT>
