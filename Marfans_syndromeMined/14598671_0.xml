<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is known to be valuable to keep spontaneous breathing in these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 42-years-old woman complicated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002777'>tracheal stenosis</z:hpo> caused by compression from the ascending and aortic pseudoaneurysm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the induction of general anesthesia for video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for high-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo>, she was placed in lateral position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Suddenly it became difficult to ventilate her and her oxygenation saturation declined with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We returned her to supine position and then could manage to ventilate her easier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>But we could not maintain stable ventilation until her spontaneous breathing appeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>VATS was cancelled and she was brought in to the ICU after extubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the ICU she developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> again soon and was reintubated under consciousness guided by bronchofiber scope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We managed successfully to keep spontaneous breathing intact under proper sedation by three <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35717">sedative drugs</z:chebi>; <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi>, midazolam and <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> for 5 days until the next operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We realized the importance of maintaining spontaneous breathing under proper sedation in a case of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002777'>tracheal stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
