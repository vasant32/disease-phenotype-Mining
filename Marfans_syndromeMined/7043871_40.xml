<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One hundred sixty consecutive patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> were reviewed for ocular, cardiovascular, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>skeletal abnormalities</z:hpo>, and were graded by severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most striking ocular abnormality was enlargement of the globe, presumably caused by scleral stretching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Staphylomata were not a feature of any of the patients seen, nor was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000563'>keratoconus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cornea, in fact, was flattened but not thinned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 160 patients, 193 eyes showed dislocation of the lens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dislocation of the lens was positively correlated with increased ocular axial length and with decreasing KJ readings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We postulate that the ocular pathologic changes are primarily caused by stretching of the tunica scleralis, and that the zonular fibers (thus under stress may "give" or may rupture in their area of presumably least density which may be the area of developmental fusion of the optic vesicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a small proportion of cases the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>lens dislocation</z:hpo> was progressive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between ocular findings, on one hand, and the skeletal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001626'>cardiovascular abnormalities</z:hpo> on the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, there was a good degree of intrafamilial consistency with regard to absence or presence of ocular pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The absence of correlation between the ocular and systemic findings in our data on these 160 patients is best explained by the existence of more than 1 point mutation, which may give rise to different but clinically similar phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results of our calculations of mutation rate were compatible with such an explanation </plain></SENT>
