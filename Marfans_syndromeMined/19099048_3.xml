<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Yale database contains information on 3,000 patients with thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo>, with 9,000 patient-years of follow-up and 9,000 imaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Advanced statistical techniques were applied to this information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analysis yielded the following Yale-generated observations: (1) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disease</z:e> with a predominantly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo>; (2) matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) enzymes are activated in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi>; (3) wall tension in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> approaches the tensile limits of aortic tissue at a diameter of 6 cm; (4) by the time a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> reaches a clinical diameter of 6 cm, 34 percent of affected patients have suffered dissection or rupture; (5) extreme physical exertion or severe emotion often precipitate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection; and (6) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> expression profile changes are being identified that predispose a patient to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> and can serve as biomarkers for screening for this virulent disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The "playbook" of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> is gradually being read, with the help of scientific investigations, positioning practitioners to combat this lethal disease more effectively than ever before </plain></SENT>
