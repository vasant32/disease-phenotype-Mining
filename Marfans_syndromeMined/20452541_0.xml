<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although surgical repair remains the standard of care for patients with enlarging and advanced aneurysmal disease, new insights into the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> have resulted in an interest in targeting these pathways and reducing the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The renin-angiotensin system is known to play a role in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation through nuclear factor-kappaB and expression of matrix degrading enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent work also suggests that angiotensin receptor blockade may also disrupt transforming growth factor beta1 signaling, resulting in a reduced rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These animal data, combined with recent retrospective trials showing markedly reduced rates of aortic root dilation in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> treated with angiotensin receptor blockers, suggest a powerful role for angiotensin receptor blockers in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
