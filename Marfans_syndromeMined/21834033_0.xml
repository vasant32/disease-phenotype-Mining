<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175695" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Sotos syndrome</z:e> show 5q35 deletions involving NSD1 or its point mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified the common 5q35 deletion in a patient with atypical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175695" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Sotos syndrome</z:e> manifesting extremely severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001382'>joint hypermobility</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000974'>skin hyperextensibility</z:hpo>, which are recognized as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268365" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Marfanoid hypermobility syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further analyses were performed to identify the genetic cause of these additional findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>aCGH analysis revealed an additional 862â€‰kb deletion of Xq22.3 in this patient, which was inherited from his healthy mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The deleted region included five genes, including the nik-related kinase gene (NRK), which would be a candidate gene for the patient's Marfanoid hypermobility, because it is a member of the glucokinase subfamily that are involved in activating the JNK pathway, and is expressed in developing skeletal musculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> seen in the patient may be derived from position effect of the deletion for neighboring interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein-like 2 gene (IL1RAPL2), which is a candidate gene for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
