<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Early results after aortic valve-sparing root reconstruction are excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Longer-term follow-up, especially with regard to aortic valve function, is required for further judgment of these techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between July of 1993 and September of 2006, 108 consecutive patients (mean age 53.0 +/- 15.8 years) underwent the Yacoub operation (group Y) and 83 patients underwent the David operation (group D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Innovative multilevel hierarchic modeling methods were used to analyze <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In general, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> increased with time in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with the development of a significant increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, concomitant cusp intervention, and preoperative aortic anulus dimension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, the initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> was higher in group Y versus group D (0.56 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> vs 0.29 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, P = .049), whereas the mean annual progression rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> was marginally higher in group Y (0.132 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> vs 0.075 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, P = .1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concomitant cusp intervention was associated with a significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> increase in both groups (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a trend that smaller preoperative aortic annulus diameters in group D and larger diameters in group Y were associated with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In regard to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> grade over time, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and a large preoperative aortic annulus diameter were better treated with the reimplantation technique, whereas those with a smaller diameter were better treated with the remodeling technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Concomitant free-edge plication of prolapsing cusps was disadvantageous in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Considering these factors may serve to improve the aortic valve longevity after valve-sparing aortic root surgery </plain></SENT>
