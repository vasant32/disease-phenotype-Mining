<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have found parallelism of adaptive response protective effect against chromosome aberrations, induced by UV activated 8-MOP and gamma-rays in repair proficient cells of healthy donors and repair deficient cells of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data lead us to conclusion that mechanism of adaption, at least in some cases has no connection with repair process modification </plain></SENT>
