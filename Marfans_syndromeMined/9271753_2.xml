<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study retrospectively analyzes the late results obtained with this adjunct in an experience extending over a twenty-year period of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1977 to March 1996, 171 patients (124 males and 47 females) aged from 15-79 years (mean age: 53 +/- 14 years) underwent an emergency operation for type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection and 144 (84%) were operated on within 48 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients (15.2%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ascending aorta was replaced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and the aortic stumps were reinforced with the GRF glue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 39 patients (23%), the aortic valve was replaced either independently (5 cases, 3%) or by means of a composite graft (34 cases, 19.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because of the location of the intimal tear, the aortic replacement was extended to the transverse arch in 58 patients (33.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hospital mortality amounts to 21% (36 patients), 22.8% in patients with arch replacement and 21.1% in patients without arch replacement (n.s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One hundred thirty-five patients were discharged and surveyed from 2 months to 19 years postoperatively (cumulative follow-up: 856 patients/years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up: 79 +/- 66 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During this period of time, 22 patients (16.1%) had to be reoperated on for a total of 28 reoperations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Six of those (27.2%) died at reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At univariate analysis, presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (p &lt; 0.05) and absence of arch replacement (p &lt; 0.02) were determinant risk factors for reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Emergency (p &lt; 0.01) and thoracoabdominal replacement (p &lt; 0.04) were determinant risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The acturial freedom from reoperation (Kaplan-Meier, CI: 95%) is: 96.08% (90.9-98.2), 87.6% (79.8-92.7), 80.9% (70.8-86.1), 66.4% (51.1-78.9) at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A total of 36 patients (27.7%) died during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (p &lt; 0.01), reoperation (p &lt; 0.02), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05) were determinant risk factors of late mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The actuarial late survival rate (K-M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>C.I.: 95%), including hospital mortality, is: 71.5% (64.3-77.8), 66% (58.3-73), 56.4% (47.7-64.7), 46.3% (36.4-56.5) at 1, 10 and 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The GRF glue has proved to be extremely useful during emergency initial surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection, making the procedure much easier and safer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Through this operative improvement, the use of the GRF glue seems to have a beneficial influence on the late results which however, depend mainly on the patient's basic condition </plain></SENT>
