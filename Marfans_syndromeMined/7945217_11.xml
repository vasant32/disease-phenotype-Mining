<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied fibrillin synthesis in cultured fibroblasts from 11 members of a three-generation family with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, caused by a large in-frame deletion in FBN1 (the fibrillin gene) leading to a loss of 366 bases in the corresponding fibrillin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Metabolic labelling with [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>]Met/Cys and <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>/PAGE allowed unequivocal identification of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and truncated fibrillin in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell strains harbouring the deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In culture medium, fibrillin and its truncated counterpart were predominant, whereas their respective larger precursors were found only in traces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This proportion, however, was markedly shifted towards the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and truncated precursors by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30740">EGTA</z:chebi> and reversed by the addition of calcium, which confirmed the existence of profibrillin and its probably calcium-dependent conversion into fibrillin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tunicamycin caused increased electrophoretic mobility of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and truncated molecules without changing their apparent size differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intracellularly, only profibrillin was found; in the mutant cells truncated and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> profibrillin molecules were present in similar amounts and both populations were secreted and deposited simultaneously into the extracellular matrix; there, however, truncated profibrillin only became easily detectable after treatment of cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34674">dextran sulphate</z:chebi>, which increased the amount of extractable profibrillin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence microscopy in patients' cultures identified fibrillin-containing microfibrils which appeared to be moderately reduced both in amount and diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural analysis by rotary-shadowing and immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated the presence of numerous beaded domains reacting with fibrillin antibodies, but no intact fibrillin microfibrils in patient's cell-layer extracts, in contrast with the extensive microfibrils elaborated by control cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest, that in the patients' cell cultures <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> microfibrils contained the truncated fibrillin molecules </plain></SENT>
