<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether late outcome differs for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and marfanoid patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, we compared characteristics of Marfan versus marfanoid patients and their survival and requirement for reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1978 to October 2003, 162 patients with a presumptive diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> underwent operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We recategorized them as confirmed Marfan (n = 122), marfanoid (n = 23), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e> (n = 5), or other (n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients categorized as marfanoid failed to meet the major criteria of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared characteristics of Marfan and marfanoid groups and assessed long-term survival and need for reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Marfan and marfanoid patients had similar demographics (women, 33% versus 39%; age, 39 +/- 13 versus 41 +/- 12 years; height, 186 +/- 12 cm versus 184 +/- 9.6 cm), valve pathophysiology (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, 66% versus 58%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo>, 58% versus 62%), and aortic pathology (dilated, 40% versus 39%; dissected, 17% versus 13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall hospital survival was 99.3% (144/145), and 10-year survival was similar at 82% in the Marfan and 100% in marfanoid groups (p = 0.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (p = 0.001) and mitral valve replacement (p = 0.003) were at higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reoperation was more frequent after separate aortic valve-ascending aorta graft operations (p = 0.04), and among taller patients (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of 24 Marfan patients with David root reimplantations, none has required reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Marfan and marfanoid patients have similar physical characteristics and postoperative survival, although reoperation was more frequent in Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Surgery before occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> or mitral valve repair should reduce the risk of reoperation, but taller patients, irrespective of Marfan or gender, are more likely to require reoperation </plain></SENT>
