<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The high mortality of untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> results almost exclusively from aortic complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, more than half of patients with Marfan-like features do not have <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, but have other diseases including inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and dissections (TAAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We elucidate the increasing spectrum of syndromes associated with Marfan-like features and discuss the clinical implications of these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed a systematic review to tabulate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inherited diseases</z:e> and syndromes carrying a risk for thoracic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We discuss evidence that different syndromes with different causative genes and mutations have different prognoses and profiles of cardiovascular manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that future decisions for optimized management of patients with inherited TAAD require a comprehensive clinical and genetic work-up </plain></SENT>
