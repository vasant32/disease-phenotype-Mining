<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is a rare complication of aortic valve replacement (11 reported cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its incidence estimated from the literature would appear to be less than 1% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aortic valve replacements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It occurs in both cases of stenosis and regurgitation (4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitations</z:hpo>, 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo>, 5 mixed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic valve disease</z:e>) and is seen in ball and cage (7 cases), tilting disc (3 cases) and bioprosthesis (1 case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six of these patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The role of the initial surgery for valve replacement in secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aortic clamping and cannulation can cause immediate dissection but may also damage the aortic wall, leading to the risk of secondary dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta was observed in 5 Cases at surgery; in 3 cases, the aorta was dilated without true <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>; in 3 other cases the aorta was considered to be macroscopically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The integrity aorta is sometimes difficult to confirm and a macroscopically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> of the aorta may have fragile aortic walls, especially in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> due to valvular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and forms frustres of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, and are associated with a risk of secondary dissection </plain></SENT>
