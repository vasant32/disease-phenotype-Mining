<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence, indications, and results of aortic arch replacement in Marfan patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 1993 and December 2005, our group performed 76 aortic replacements in 54 Marfan patients (mean age, 38.3 years), of whom 20 had already undergone one or two replacements of the thoracic aorta, and 3 required one late procedure each in other institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>So, the 54 patients underwent a total of 100 aortic operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indication for initial surgery was elective aortic root replacement in 25 patients (46%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection in 19 (35%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type B dissection in 2 (4%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type B dissection in 8 (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indication for reoperation was residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection in the proximal aorta in 14 patients (36%), in the distal aorta in 22 (56%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> retrograde type A dissection in 3 (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At initial operation, the aortic arch was not involved in the 25 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the aortic root and was replaced in only 1 of the 19 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection (1/44 patients, 2.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the second or third operation, the arch had to be replaced in 4 (16%) of 25 patients initially operated on for aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, in 14 (73%) of 19 patients operated on for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection, and in 3 (30%) of 10 patients with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type B dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference between patients with initial elective aortic root replacement and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection was highly significant (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall in-hospital mortality was 13% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 9.6% per procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aortic arch replacement in Marfan patients is not indicated during elective aortic root replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the significant rate of aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0005113'>dilatation of the aortic arch</z:hpo> after surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection may be an incentive for a more aggressive approach toward the aortic arch during initial surgery </plain></SENT>
