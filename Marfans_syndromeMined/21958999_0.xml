<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Stanford type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> is a rare phenomenon with high short-term mortality and clinical manifestations that can make differential diagnosis a lengthy process requiring several diagnostic examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Based on a case report, the aim is to highlight the importance of physical examination in the initial management of these patients and of rapid access to a surgical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A brief review follows on the diagnosis and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004933'>ascending aortic dissection</z:hpo>, and its specific nature in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 33-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department of a district hospital with chest and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, 20 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initial physical examination revealed an aortic systolic murmur and musculoskeletal morphological abnormalities compatible with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Given suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, a transthoracic echocardiogram was immediately performed, which showed an extensive intimal flap originating at the sinotubular junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>He was transferred to the cardiothoracic surgery department of a referral hospital where he was treated by a Bentall procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this case, careful physical examination during initial assessment raised the suspicion that this patient was in a high-risk group for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, thus avoiding unnecessary and lengthy exams </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This diagnosis requires emergent surgical treatment, and so direct contact in real time between those making in the diagnosis and the surgeon is essential, as well as protocols governing immediate access to a surgical center </plain></SENT>
