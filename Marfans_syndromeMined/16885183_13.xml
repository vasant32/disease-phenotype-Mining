<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical findings and natural history in 22 carriers of an R460H mutation in the transforming growth factor beta receptor 2 gene (TGFbetaR2) from a five-generation kindred ascertained by familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 13 of the confirmed carriers were interviewed and examined, and information about the remaining carrier was obtained from medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical information about deceased individuals was obtained, when possible, from postmortem reports, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates and medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There have been eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden deaths</z:hpo>; the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six cases in which a postmortem examination was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three individuals had undergone aortic replacement surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dissection had occurred throughout the aorta, and in one case in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo>, due to a ruptured berry <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, had occurred in two individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four gene carriers and one deceased family member who were investigated had tortuous cerebral blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One had tortuous vertebral arteries, two had tortuous carotid arteries and one a tortuous abdominal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two individuals were found to have a brachiocephalic artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and a subclavian artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite the predisposition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> and dissection, individuals did not frequently manifest the skeletal features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, with the exception of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001382'>joint hypermobility</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No one individual had ocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>lens dislocation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001065'>Striae</z:hpo> and herniae were common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was some overlap with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e> type 4, OMIM 130050, with soft <z:mp ids='MP_0001201'>translucent skin</z:mp>, which is easily bruised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Other features were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> and a tendency to <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> easily, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002619'>varicose veins</z:hpo> and prominent skin <z:hpo ids='HP_0001065'>striae</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This family provides further evidence that mutations in TGFbetaR2 cause a distinct syndrome that needs to be distinguished from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> to direct investigation and management of patients and shows the natural history, spectrum of clinical features and variable penetrance of this newly recognised condition </plain></SENT>
