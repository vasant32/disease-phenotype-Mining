<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Spontaneous intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> is a postural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> syndrome unrelated to dural puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to the apparent failure of epidural blood patch to relieve <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in spontaneous intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, we investigated the epidemiologic features and treatment outcomes of this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical findings and management of 22 cases (21 published + 1 reported) of spontaneous intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study population was stratified by age and sex; continuous variables were compared for differences by t-tests; categorical variables were compared by Fisher exact tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were identified by P values of.05 or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 43 +/- 16 years, with a female:male ratio of 3.4:1.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Females with spontaneous intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> were younger (P =.050) than males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Men presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> (P =.021) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defects</z:hpo> (P =.009) more often than women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Meningeal enhancement on contrast magnetic resonance imaging was the most consistent radiographic finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Radionuclide cisternography showed thoracolumbar dural leaks in 7 of 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure was low in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (33.13 +/- 31.02 mm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Epidural blood patch was performed in 8 patients, repeated in 3 patients, failed in 3 patients, and offered only transient improvement in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> was more common in women than men, was not uniformly responsive to epidural blood patch, and had significant comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The management of postural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in spontaneous intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> by other techniques to restore cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and prevent its leakage should be investigated </plain></SENT>
