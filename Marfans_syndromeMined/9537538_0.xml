<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From September 1979 to February 1996, 79 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> underwent aortic root replacement using composite grafts (n=68, Bentall-technique 63, button-technique 5), and ascending aortic replacement with a valve-sparing procedure (n=11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 12 patients (15.2%) who simultaneously received partial or total arch replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>55 patients (69.6%) were male, and 24 female (30.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average age was 33.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-one patient (51.9%) had non-dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> while the remaining 38 patients suffered from either <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (24.0%) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (24.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aortic valve was involved in 97.5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total early mortality (&lt; or =30 days) was 3.8%, 10.5% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and 2.4% for non-dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no early postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in patients after valve-sparing operation and in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The follow-up rate was 98.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 68+/-25 months 10 patients (13.3%) died and cardiac complications were a common cause of the late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no late mortality in the valve-sparing operations during a mean follow-up period of 8+/-6 months, however, 1 required valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>19 (25.3%) of the 75 patients surviving late have undergone 25 secondary operations on the cardiovascular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Reoperations at aortic sites distant from the original were much more frequent after primary repair for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection when compared to non-dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (p&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with composite graft replacement including early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> was 91.2% at 1 year, 84.4% at 5 years and 75.2% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Composite graft insertion has become the gold standard for treating Marfan-patients with non-dissecting and dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Our early experience in 11 patients with valve-sparing procedures indicated that this,variant may be the better choice in selected patients </plain></SENT>
