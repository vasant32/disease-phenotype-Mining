<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The definition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values is a prerequisite for the reliable evaluation of abnormality in the lumbar spine, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003416'>spinal canal stenosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Values for vertebral body diameter (VBD) and dural sac diameter (DSD) for the lumbar spine have been published in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In children, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values have been established using conventional radiography or myelography, but not by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To define <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values for the sagittal diameter of the vertebral body and dural sac, and to calculate a dural sac ratio (DSR) in the lumbosacral spine (L1-S1) in healthy children using MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 75 healthy children between 6 years and 17 years of age were examined using a sagittal T2-weighted sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sagittal VBD and DSD were measured and a DSR was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was a retrospective and cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With increasing age there is a significant increase of VBD, a slight increase of DSD, and a slight decrease of DSR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There is no significant sex difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DSR in healthy children is higher than in healthy adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MRI is a reliable method demonstrating the natural shape of the lumbosacral spine and its absolute values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values compare well with those established by conventional radiological techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our data may serve as a reference for defining <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
