<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: The primary goal of this study was to determine if atopy is a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000563'>keratoconus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Other potential risk factors were also studied and included age, sex, race, eye rubbing, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, handedness, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262428" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">collagen vascular disease</z:e>, ocular trauma, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000580'>pigmentary retinopathy</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down's syndrome</z:e>, and a history of contact lens wear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case-control study was designed (n=120) with incident cases assembled from the years 1985-99 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Controls were chosen from the same person-time experience as cases and were picked from a source population with multiple outcomes ensuring that none was knowingly related to any of the potential exposures being studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Atopy was defined based on the UK working group 1994 definition (at least 4/6 criteria = complete, 3/6 criteria = incomplete, and at least 1/6 criteria = partial) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000563'>Keratoconus</z:hpo> was defined based on clinical criteria and previously published I-S values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression was used in the analysis to obtain the odds ratios as the measure of association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the univariate associations, there was an association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000563'>keratoconus</z:hpo> and atopy as well as eye rubbing and family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000563'>keratoconus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in the multivariate analysis, only eye rubbing was still a significant predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000563'>keratoconus</z:hpo> (odds ratio = 6.31 p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the hypothesis that the most significant cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000563'>keratoconus</z:hpo> is eye rubbing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Atopy may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000563'>keratoconus</z:hpo> but most probably via eye rubbing associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">itch</z:e> of atopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No other variable measured was significantly associated with the aetiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000563'>keratoconus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
