<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He has an extensive surgical history including aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The L <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was treated first with an L carotid-vertebral artery vein bypass, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> debranching, and stent-graft repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> via the L brachial artery approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The R <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was treated by placing a stent graft from the proximal R common carotid artery across the R subclavian artery origin and landing in the prosthetic innominate bypass graft via an L common carotid artery conduit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> debranching and R carotid-subclavian artery bypass completed the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A proximal type I endoleak was detected in the R <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> sac on follow-up computed tomography angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was treated with sternotomy, aorta to L common carotid artery bypass, stent graft removal, and oversewing of the R subclavian artery origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient recovered uneventfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subclavian artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are rarely diagnosed in patients with Marfan disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although durability remains unproven, hybrid repair should be considered in patients with subclavian artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, to minimize the morbidity commonly associated with open repair </plain></SENT>
