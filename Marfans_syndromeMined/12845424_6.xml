<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because there is uncertainty regarding the BMD status of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, we undertook an analysis of BMD in both adults and children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry analysis was performed on a convenience sample of 51 patients (30 adults and 21 children) with diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> from 1993 to 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T-Scores (i.e. the number of standard deviations above or below the average <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peak bone density) were determined for comparison of adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean+/-SD of individual BMD values were used for comparison of the data of children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to standard values obtained from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adult patients, adult males with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> demonstrated significantly reduced femoral neck BMD with an average T-score of -1.54 ( P&lt;0.001), diagnostic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000938'>osteopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000938'>osteopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> were observed in several middle aged and pre- and postmenopausal women, the average T-score value for adult females and children were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The etiology and full significance of <z:mp ids='MP_0000063'>decreased BMD</z:mp> in adult male patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> remain uncertain at the present time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results lead us to question the value of aggressive BMD evaluations by DXA in these patients, particularly prior to reaching mid-age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further investigations will be required to shed insights into the natural history of BMD in adults and children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Any application of bone mineral replacement therapy such as bisphosphonate, selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50739">estrogen receptor modulators</z:chebi>, hormone replacement therapy and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> in these patients may be premature based on the existing evidence </plain></SENT>
