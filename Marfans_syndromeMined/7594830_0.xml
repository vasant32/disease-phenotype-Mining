<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven patients of type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> were underwent operations from Jan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>1985 to Nov </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of patients who underwent graft replacement of the aorta and received aortogram after the operation was twenty-nine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate factors affecting the occurrence of anastomotic leakage after graft replacement of the aorta, the aortograms of the 29 patients were examined retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aortograms revealed leakage at the distal anastomotic site on 11 of the 29 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight factors: the kind of graft, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, the use of felt at the anastomotic site, the clamping method, distal anastomotic site, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, the state of the aortic wall at the anastomotic site and the blood pressure control after operation, were examined relating to the occurrence of anastomotic leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed 3 factors; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, the state of the aortic wall and the blood pressure control, affected the occurrence of anastomotic leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In short, the anastomotic leakage easily occurred in patients who underwent in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage and whose blood pressure was uncontrolled after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, strict control of the blood pressure after the operation is the most effective for preventing anastomotic leakage </plain></SENT>
