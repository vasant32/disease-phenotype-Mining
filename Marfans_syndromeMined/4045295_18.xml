<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An intrinsic defect in the aortic media in six patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, who died of cardiovascular complications of the disease at an average age of 32 years, has been delineated by correlated morphologic, biochemical, and mechanical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The findings in the Marfan aortas have been compared with those in age- and sex-matched controls, who died of unrelated diseases without significant aortic lesions, and in three patients with dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of non-Marfan origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that there was a significant reduction in the tensile strength of the aorta in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This finding was correlated by scanning electron microscopy with structural alterations of the medial elastic fibers, including enlarged interlaminar spaces and loss of interlaminar elastic fibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No structural alterations were identified in collagen fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biochemical analyses of the aortic media revealed a substantial reduction in aortic elastin content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37628">desmosine</z:chebi> content of the isolated elastin was reduced by approximately 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No changes were detected in the composition or solubility of the medial collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to Marfan aortas, the elastin and collagen contents of the dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of non-Marfan origin were similar to those of the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the vascular complications in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> may be based on a genetic abnormality affecting elastin fibrillogenesis </plain></SENT>
