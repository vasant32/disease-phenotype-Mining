<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nowhere is this better exemplified than in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disorders</z:e> associated with certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> of collagen metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For instance, the life-threatening vascular complications of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e> IV, the Sack-Barabas type, appears to be related to a number of defects in the production of Type III procollagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The large size of the collagen genes and the complexity of the biochemistry of collagen have not made research a simple task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the location of certain genes is now known with a reasonable degree of accuracy and a few have been cloned in their entirety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The future investigation of these genetic mutations holds great excitement for those engaged in research in this fascinating field </plain></SENT>
