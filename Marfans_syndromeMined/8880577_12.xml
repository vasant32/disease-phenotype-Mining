<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with nMFS have mitral and tricuspid valve involvement and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo>, and die of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, often in the first year of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although mutations in classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> have been observed along the entire length of the FBN1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, mutations in nMFS appear to cluster in a relatively small region of FBN1, approximately between exons 24 and 34 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we describe the appearance of two FBN1 mutations in a single allele of an infant with nMFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The changes were within six bases of each other in exon 26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One was a T3212G transversion resulting in an I1071S amino acid substitution and the second was an A3219T transversion resulting in an E1073D amino acid substitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is the first reported double mutant allele in FBN1 </plain></SENT>
