<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The elephant trunk procedure is used for extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated its safety, newer indications, and influence of second-stage completion on survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Records were reviewed for 94 consecutive patients (age 67 +/- 11 years, 47% men) who underwent the procedure between November 1990 and February 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The trunk was implanted as an extension of the ascending aorta and arch graft in 83 of 94 (88.3%) patients, distal arch graft in 8 of 94 (8.5%) patients, and in 3 distal to the left subclavian artery (3 of 94 patients [3.2%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic dissection</z:hpo> was present in 37 (39.4%) patients and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> was present in 7 (7.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three were reoperations (24.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 9 patients, the trunk procedure was adjunctive in preparation for the second operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 15 patients, the anastomosis was completed between the left subclavian and common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Coronary artery bypass was performed in 36 (38.4%) and aortic valve operation in 55 (58.5%; 20 root sparing repairs, 16 composite grafts and 19 replacements) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were two early 30-day in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (2.1%) and 5 permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (5.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eleven died before the second-stage procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven (57%) underwent second-stage procedures; 40 by thoracotomy and 7 by stent graft insertion, including 2 thoracoabdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> repairs with visceral bypasses before stent grafting with 4 early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (8.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Five-year survival was 34% without a second-stage procedure versus 75% 3-year survival with it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: With a current total of 142 elephant trunk procedures, we found it is safe and should be used more with initial cardiac surgery before descending or thoracoabdominal aorta repair </plain></SENT>
