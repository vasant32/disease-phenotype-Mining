<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic-linkage analysis has implicated the fibrillin-2 gene (FBN2) as the CCA locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutation analysis of two isolated CCA patients revealed missense mutations, indicating that defects in FBN2 may be responsible for this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, cosegregation of a mutant allele with the disease phenotype has not yet been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the primary cause of CCA in a large well-characterized kindred with five generations comprising 18 affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Previous studies demonstrated linkage of this family's CCA phenotype to FBN2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutation analysis of cDNA derived from the proband and her affected brother, using a nonisotopic RNase cleavage assay, revealed the partial skipping of exon 31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Approximately 25% mutant transcript is produced, which is apparently sufficient to cause a CCA phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of genomic DNA revealed an unusual base composition for intron 30 and identified the mutation, a g-26t transversion, in the vicinity of the splicing branch-point site in intron 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA from 30 additional family members, both affected and unaffected, then was analyzed for the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results clearly demonstrate cosegregation of the branch-point mutation with the CCA phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of a CCA mutation in a multiplex family, unequivocally establishing that mutation in FBN2 are responsible for the CCA phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, branch-point mutations only very rarely have been associated with human disease, suggesting that the unusual composition of this intron influences splicing stability </plain></SENT>
