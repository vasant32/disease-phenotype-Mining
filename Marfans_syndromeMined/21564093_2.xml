<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) is challenging and international criteria have been proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 1996 Ghent criteria were adopted worldwide, but new diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> were released in 2010, giving more weight to aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to compare the diagnosis reached by applying this new nosology vs the Ghent nosology in a well-known series of 1009 probands defined by the presence of an FBN1 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 842 patients could be classified as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> according to the new nosology (83%) as compared to 894 (89%) according to the 1996 Ghent criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining 17% would be classified as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> syndrome (ELS), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> syndrome or mitral valve, aorta, skeleton and skin (MASS) syndrome, or potential <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> in patients aged less than 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Taking into account the median age at last follow-up (29 years), the possibility has to be considered that these patients would go on to develop classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the number of patients for a given diagnosis differed only slightly, the new nosology led to a different diagnosis in 15% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Indeed, 10% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients were reclassified as ELS or MASS in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo>; conversely, 5% were reclassified as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The nosology is easier to apply because the systemic score is helpful to reach the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> only in a minority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic criteria should be a flexible and dynamic tool so that reclassification of patients with alternative diagnosis is possible, requiring regular clinical and aortic follow-up </plain></SENT>
