<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is apparent that significant progress has been made in our understanding of the biosynthesis, modifications, and maturation of collagen and elastin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We now recognize and partially understand special reactions involved in hydroxylations within the cell and complex cross-linking processes occurring outside the cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent experiments (191) have shown that in human diploid fibroblast cultures of limited doubling potential (191) the hydroxylation of collagen <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26274,32874">prolyl</z:chebi> residues appears to be "age" or passage-level dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With increasing passage level of these cultures, both the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22651">ascorbate</z:chebi> requirements and the extent of collagen hydroxylation decrease. "Young" cell cultures have a strong requirement for complete hydroxylation and without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22651">ascorbate</z:chebi> there is only about 50% of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level. "Middle-aged" cultures show higher hydroxylation without and full hydroxylation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22651">ascorbate</z:chebi>, whereas "old" (or cultures close to "senescence") are incapable of full hydroxylation with or without <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the overall system may show some deterioration with increasing passage levels, it appears that with increasing passage levels other components in the cell replace the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22651">ascorbate</z:chebi> dependence of the hydroxylase system to a greater exten </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In some ways, aging WI-38 cultures begin to resemble some transformed cells in their biochemical reactions, although they continue to remain diploid and eventually lose the ability to replicate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is not yet known whether old animals can produce collagen, which may now be underhydroxylated, perhaps contributing to certain senescent changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Careful examination of the hydroxylation index of collagen produced in organoid cultures of tissue biopsies as a function of donor age might be informative, particularly if one looks at the quality of collagen by employing collagenase and other proteolytic digests with collagen (191) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One could comare the levels of frequent and characteristic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> triplet sequences such as Gly-Pro-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17368">Hyp</z:chebi> to Gly-Pro-Pro, Gly-Ala-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17368">Hyp</z:chebi> to Gly-Ala-Pro, or Gly-Pro-Hyl to Gly-Pro-Lys and others for evaluation of hydroxylation throughout the entire molecule or at selected sequences </plain></SENT>
