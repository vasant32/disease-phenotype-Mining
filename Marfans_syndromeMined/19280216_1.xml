<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Visceral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (VAA) are rare forms of vascular pathology, with an incidence of 0.1% to 0.2% in routine autopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They frequently present as a life-threatening, often fatal, emergency, if associated with rupture and intra- or retroperitoneal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical symptoms, natural history, and mortality of VAAs vary depending on the vessels involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mortality rates range from 8.5% up to 25% and, in pregnant women, up to 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A retrospective analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> VAAs diagnosed at our institution from 1991 to 2006 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presentation, management, and outcome of therapy was evaluated for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients (12 men, 11 women, mean age 55.8 years) with 31 VAAs were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The anatomical involvement concerned seven regions: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">celiac</z:e> (CT) nine, superior mesenteric (SMA) seven, splenic (SA) five, hepatic (HA) six, gastroduodenal (GDA) two, pancreatoduodenal (<z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp>) one, and one branch of the superior mesenteric artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients presented symptoms attributable to their <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, which included a total of four ruptures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had no symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The etiology of VAAs was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (67.8%), mycotic embolization (12.9%), trauma (9.7%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan Syndrome</z:e> (3.2%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome</z:e> (3.2%), and giant cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> (3.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Open surgery was performed for 29 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in 21 patients: partial resection and tailoring in 13 cases (41.9%), resection of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with additional autologous vein graft interposition in nine cases and prosthetic graft interposition in 2 cases (35.5%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> exclusion by ligation in three cases (9.6%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> ligation combined with additional autologous bypass procedure in two cases (6.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients (6.5%) were treated interventionally with embolization, in one case each with a right hepatic artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and in the other with splenic artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The morbidity rate associated with surgical treatment was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>After treatment, a total of 17 patients were followed up for a period ranging from 3 to 154 months (mean 54.6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients required no additional procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The patency rate of the reconstructed visceral arteries was 90.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Six patients were lost for follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Surgical and interventional therapy of VAAs can be life-saving treatments for the patient with a low periprocedural morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The success rate, defined as the exclusion of VAA rupture and the absence of abdominal discomfort, in our material was 88.2% after a mean follow-up of 54.6 months </plain></SENT>
