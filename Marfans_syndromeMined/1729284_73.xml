<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the synthesis, secretion, and aggregation into the extracellular matrix of fibrillin by dermal fibroblasts from 26 probands with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cells from seven probands synthesized approximately half the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> amount of fibrillin when compared with intrafamilial or unrelated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cells from an additional seven probands synthesized a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> amount of fibrillin but secreted the protein less efficiently than control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cells from a further eight probands synthesized and secreted <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> amounts of fibrillin but the protein was poorly incorporated into extracellular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cells from the remaining four probands were indistinguishable from control cells in their synthesis and processing of fibrillin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cells from 18 family members of 10 of the probands were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cells from affected individuals in the same family had the same biochemical defect and those from unaffected family members were indistinguishable from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that mutations in the gene that encodes fibrillin are responsible for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in the majority of individuals (confirming recent immunohistochemical and genetic linkage studies) and that a variety of mutations can produce the phenotype associated with the syndrome </plain></SENT>
