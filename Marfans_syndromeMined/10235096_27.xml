<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, limited and conflicting information exists regarding the impact of pharmacologic therapy on aortic growth rate in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three children and adolescents with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> underwent physical examination, anthropometric evaluation, and echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relation of pharmacologic therapy to aortic growth rate was examined in the 44 subjects in whom serial echocardiograms were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although boys and girls did not differ in ocular, skeletal, or cardiovascular manifestations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> tended to be more common in boys (86% vs 72%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> at baseline (42 of 53 or 79%) were more likely to also have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> and mitral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> (both p &lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The medicated patients had slower aortic growth than the unmedicated patients with regard to both absolute aortic growth rate (p &lt;0.01) and aortic growth rate adjusted for age and body size (p &lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, major cardiovascular complications developed in 5 patients despite long-term pharmacologic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, beta-blocker and calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> therapy retards aortic growth rate in children and adolescents with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
