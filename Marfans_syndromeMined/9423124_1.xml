<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prior to a median sternotomy, femoro vein-femoral artery partial cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted occationaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Operative technique of repair of coronary detachment were direct closure in 6 and interposition graft technique in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
