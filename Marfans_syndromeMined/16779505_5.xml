<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aortic repair has been recommended for these patients to prevent rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine outcomes following endovascular stent graft (EVSG) repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> in this patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over an 8-year period, 11 patients (six men, five women) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathies</z:e> underwent endovascular aortic repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 50 (range 15-81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diseases included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (n = 6), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu's disease</z:e> (n = 3), and giant cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Success of EVSG repair was evaluated per the reporting standards of the Society for Vascular Surgery/American Association for Vascular Surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was a mean of 28.9 months (range 3-68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients underwent EVSG repair of the thoracic aorta, four underwent EVSG repair of the abdominal aorta, and one underwent a staged repair of the thoracic and subsequently the abdominal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six true <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and six pseudoaneurysms were repaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had previous aortic surgery, including four with multiple aortic operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For the 12 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated, technical success was achieved in 11 (91.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One technical failure occurred due to a small iliac access vessel, requiring an eventual iliac conduit for insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Early complications (&lt;30 days) occurred in three patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>EVSG repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> is feasible and can be safely performed in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
