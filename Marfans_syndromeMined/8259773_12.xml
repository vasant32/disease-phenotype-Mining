<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: With effective surgical correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo>, skeletal health is an important issue for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000938'>Osteopenia</z:hpo> has been radiographically described, yet no systematic evaluation of bone status has been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the bone mineral density (BMD, g/cm2) in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventeen women, 37.2 +/- 7.3 years old, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was used to measure BMD at the lumbar spine (L2-L4), proximal femur, and total body in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>Scoliosis</z:hpo> scores were assigned from 0 (no curvature) to 3 (severe curvature) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Highly significant deficits in BMD were observed at the proximal femur (p = 0.0001) as well as of the whole body (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Femoral neck BMD Z-score (mean +/- SD) = -1.36 +/- 0.94, trochanter Z = -1.07 +/- 0.80, and intertrochanter Z = -1.44 +/- 0.71; whole-body BMD Z-score = -0.30 +/- 0.16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BMD at L2-L4, however, did not differ from age-predicted values, Z = -0.48 +/- 1.16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant association between BMD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, nor between BMD and fracture history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To correct for bone size, the bone mineral apparent density (BMAD, g/cm3) was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The femoral neck BMAD values (mean +/- SD) were significantly lower than predicted (0.125 +/- 0.02 versus 0.147 +/- 0.001 g/cm3, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> menarche, and 15 reported regular menses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no history of nontraumatic fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> have bone deficits at the proximal femur as well as of the whole body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This deficit is not related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> and persists when corrected for bone size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> may be at increased risk for proximal femoral fracture </plain></SENT>
