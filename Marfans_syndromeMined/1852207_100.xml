<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The microfibrils of the suspensory ligament of the lens as well as the elastic fibre microfibrils of the blood vessel wall are composed of fibrillin </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistological experiments have recently implicated fibrillin microfibrils in the pathogenesis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genetic linkage data localizing the Marfan gene to chromosome 15 and the in situ hybridization of fibrillin complementary DNA to 15q21.1 together support fibrillin as a candidate Marfan gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a first step towards investigating the function of fibrillin in the architecture and development of connective tissues and its relationship to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, we report the cloning and partial sequencing of fibrillin cDNA </plain></SENT>
