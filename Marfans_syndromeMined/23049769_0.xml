<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Quality of life (QoL) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease is impaired and cannot be solely explained by disease severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored whether genetic variability and activity contributes to QoL in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>), a genetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In 121 MFS patients, patient characteristics (i.e. demographics and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>-related symptoms) were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients completed the SF-36 to measure QoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, transcriptome wide gene expression and 484 Single Nucleotide Polymorphysms (SNPs) in cytokine genes were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>QoL was first analyzed and associated with patient characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients' physical QoL was impaired and weakly related with age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, whereas mental quality of life (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e>) was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To explain a largely lacking correlation between disease severity and QoL, we related genome wide gene expression to QoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> scores had high expression levels of CXCL9 and CXCL11 cytokine-related genes (p=0.001; p=0.002); similarly, patients with low vitality scores had high expression levels of CXCL9, CXCL11 and IFNA6 cytokine-related genes (p=0.02; p=0.02; p=0.04), independent of patient characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, we associated cytokine related SNPs to mental QoL (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> and vitality) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SNP-cluster in the IL4R gene showed a weak association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> and vitality (strongest association p=0.0017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although overall mental QoL was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, &gt;10% of patients had low scores for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> and vitality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Post-hoc analysis of systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> showed that patients with lowest <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> and vitality scores had high levels of CCL11 cytokine (p=0.03; p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Variation in the cytokine genetic pathway and its activation is related to mental QoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings might allow us to identify and, ultimately, treat patients susceptible to poor QoL </plain></SENT>
