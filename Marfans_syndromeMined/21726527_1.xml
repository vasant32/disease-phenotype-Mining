<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FBN1 encodes the extracellular matrix protein, fibrillin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to elucidate the extent that variation in <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> splicing contributes to FBN1 isoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To identify FBN1 splice variants, we scanned each of its 64 internal exons in a set of pooled human brain cDNA samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FBN1 splicing is generally efficient as we identified only two variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither variant has previously been reported in the literature and include (i) an isoform which contains a cryptic 105 basepair exon between exons 54 and 55 (54A-FBN1) and (ii) an isoform which contains a cryptic 62 basepair exon between exons 57 and 58 (57A-FBN1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We compared 57A-FBN1 and FBN1 expression in multiple human tissues, including adult skeletal muscle and brain, as well as fetal skeletal muscle, brain, liver, aorta, lung, skin, and heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>57A-FBN1 represents 8-44% of FBN1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and varies in a tissue- and development-specific fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In adult brain, 57A-FBN1 represented 39±3 (%, mean±SD) of total FBN1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 57A-FBN1 represented 19±2 (%, mean±SD) of FBN1 expression in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In fetal tissue, the 57A-FBN1 proportion was highest in brain (27%) and low elsewhere, e.g., skin, aorta and lung (9-13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In summary, a significant proportion of FBN1 is expressed as 57A-FBN1 and this proportion varies in a tissue- and development-specific fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Since the 57A insertion creates a premature stop codon that mimics Marfan-associated mutations, the protein encoded by 57A-FBN1 is likely to not be functional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that altered splicing may modulate disease severity, regulate FBN1 expression, and potentially represent a therapeutic target </plain></SENT>
