<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We delineated a new syndrome presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, dissections and tortuosity throughout the arterial tree in association with mild craniofacial features and skeletal and cutaneous anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> syndromes, most of these affected individuals presented with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002758'>osteoarthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We mapped the genetic locus to chromosome 15q22.2-24.2 and show that the disease is caused by mutations in SMAD3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This gene encodes a member of the TGF-β pathway that is essential for TGF-β signal transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SMAD3 mutations lead to increased aortic expression of several key players in the TGF-β pathway, including SMAD3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Molecular diagnosis will allow early and reliable identification of cases and relatives at risk for major cardiovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings endorse the TGF-β pathway as the primary pharmacological target for the development of new treatments for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002758'>osteoarthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
