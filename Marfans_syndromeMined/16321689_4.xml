<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To identify which patients were at high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo>, we echocardiographically studied 43 patients (age 22 +/- 14 years) with the mean follow-up period of 5.2 +/- 3.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aortic diameters, left ventricular (LV) size, fractional shortening, and the severity of aortic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transmitral peak early and atrial flow velocities, their ratio and the deceleration time of peak early velocity were also obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean annual increases of aortic diameters were 0.4 +/- 0.3 mm at the annulus, 1.5 +/- 1.3 mm at the sinuses of Valsalva, 0.7 +/- 0.6 mm at the supraaortic ridge and 0.4 +/- 0.4 mm at the proximal ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the aortic growth rate at the sinuses of Valsalva level: rapid (R, &gt;3% per year, 15 patients) or slow (S, &lt; or =3% per year, 28 patients) progression groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Measured variables did not show significant differences between the 2 groups except older age, higher blood pressure and more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> in group R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis identified prolonged deceleration time as the most important variable predicting aortic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic dissection</z:hpo> occurred more frequently in group R (7 patients, 47%) than in group S (0%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Marfan patients at older age, with higher blood pressure, and with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> were at high risk of progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo>, with the most remarkable increase at the sinuses of Valsalva </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prolonged deceleration time may relate to an increased risk for aortic complications </plain></SENT>
