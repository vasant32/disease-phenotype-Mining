<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1981 and 2000, 44 consecutive children (mean age 6.8+/-4.7 years, 2 months--16 years) underwent mechanical MVR in Southampton </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three children were less than 5-years-old and nine were infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Disease aetiology was congenital in 37, rheumatic in four, infective in two and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>Mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> was present in 36 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> in eight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concomitant procedures were performed in 13, including aortic valve replacement (AVR) in seven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was complete (mean 6.4+/-4.8 years, 1 month--18.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall operative mortality was 14% (six patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Before and after 1990 operative mortality was 31 vs 3.6% (P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From 1990, operative mortality for infants was zero out of six, for children less than 5-years-old was one out of 16 (one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after emergency AVR and MVR) and for older children it was 0/12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seven children experienced valve or anticoagulation treatment-related events and eight had a mitral valve re-operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ten-year freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, prosthetic valve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, paravalvular leak and a mitral valve re-operation was 92.8+/-5.2, 97.3+/-2.7, 97.7+/-2.3, 97.2+/-2.7 and 75+/-9.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall 10-year survival was 78+/-7% (four late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>); for children under vs over 5 years it was 61+/-11 vs 95.2+/-4.6% (P=0.02), for atrio-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>AVSD</z:mp>) vs other pathology 55+/-15 vs 89+/-6.1% (P=0.05) and for those operated before 1990 vs after 1990 it was 63+/-8.1 vs 86+/-8.2% (P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical MVR, in the current era, carries a low operative risk across the spectrum of paediatric age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Late survival is better for older children and those having no-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>AVSD</z:mp> pathology but it has improved substantially during the 1990s irrespective of age and disease aetiology </plain></SENT>
