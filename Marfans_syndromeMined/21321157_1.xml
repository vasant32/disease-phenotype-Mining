<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is debate concerning whether an aneurysmal ascending aorta should be replaced when associated with a dysfunctioning aortic valve that is to be replaced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine this issue, we divided the patients by type of aortic valve dysfunction-either <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> (AS) or pure <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> (AR)-something not previously undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Of 122 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> (unassociated with <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection), the aortic valve was congenitally malformed (unicuspid or bicuspid) in 58 (98%) of the 59 AS patients, and in 38 (60%) of the 63 pure AR patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ascending aortic medial elastic fiber loss (EFL) (graded 0 to 4+) was zero or 1+ in 53 (90%) of the AS patients, in 20 (53%) of the 38 AR patients with bicuspid valves, and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 12 AR patients with tricuspid valves unassociated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An unadjusted analysis showed that, among the 96 patients with congenitally malformed valves, the 38 AR patients had a significantly higher likelihood of 2+ to 4+ EFL than the 58 AS patients (crude odds ratio: 8.78; 95% confidence interval: 2.95, 28.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data strongly suggest that the type of aortic valve dysfunction-AS versus pure AR-is very helpful in predicting loss of aortic medial elastic fibers in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic valve disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
