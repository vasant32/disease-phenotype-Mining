<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further explore the alterations characterizing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, musculoskeletal tissues from affected and healthy cattle were subjected to histochemical and histomorphometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrated reduced elastic fiber content in the periosteum, capsule, interosseous ligament, and flexor tendons of the metatarsophalangeal joint of affected cattle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The elastic properties of a tissue are supplied by elastic fibers in the extracellular matrix; therefore, their reduced content in articular tissues suggests that these fibers could be functionally incompetent to withstand <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stress, causing a predisposition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001388'>joint laxity</z:hpo> and dislocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, perichondrial-periosteal membranes, which are made of collagen and elastic fibers, are known to affect the growth process of the long bones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The decrease in the number of elastic fibers in these membranes could result in reduced restraint of skeletal growth and explain some <z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>skeletal abnormalities</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (i.e., dolichostenomelic habitus) </plain></SENT>
