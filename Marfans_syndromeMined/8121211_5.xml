<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is important for the practitioner to recognize the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> physiologic changes that occur in the exercising athlete that correspond to AHS so as to differentiate them from conditions placing an athlete at risk for SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Different clinical entities account for SCD in athletes under age 30 as opposed to over age 30, although there is some overlap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comprehensive and expensive screening tests have not proved to be cost-effective, nor are they able consistently to identify athletes at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A quality history and thorough cardiac screening examination are the best means to identify athletes at risk for SCD and lead to a cost-effective means to pursue further workup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Table 7 lists a screening battery of tests and what the tests detect and miss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In general, a history and physical examination detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> and a portion of HCM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If the physical examination is suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and a chest roentgenogram is done, a larger portion of cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> will be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When an ECG is added to the series, most of the HCM patients at risk for SCD can be diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, if echocardiography is added, most patients with HCM and cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> can be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If an exercise stress test is then performed, 20% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and congenital artery anomalies are identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additional studies, including Holter monitoring, electrophysiologic studies, and <z:chebi fb="80" ids="30440">thallium</z:chebi> scintigraphy, can be added to identify further at-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because some asymptomatic patients present with SCD, it is virtually impossible to identify comprehensively <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>By knowing what questions to ask, performing a thorough cardiac screening examination, and being more aware of potential diagnostic clues, the practitioner can feel comfortable in identifying most patients at risk for SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Specific history and physical examination guidelines regarding screening for competition are included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Supplemental information is found in the 16th Bethesda Conference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In addition, a well-outlined emergency plan needs to be established when physicians, athletic trainers, or coaches are working with athletes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Proper recognition of cardiac symptoms is a key point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Appropriate education including basic first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation training should be encouraged for anyone working extensively with athletes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The emergency plan should include on-site treatment, mechanism to contact emergency personnel, and proper transport to a qualified facility </plain></SENT>
