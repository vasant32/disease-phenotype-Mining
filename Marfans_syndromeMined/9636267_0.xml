<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In infantile <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, although involvement of the mitral valve is the most frequently encountered cardiovascular lesion, the aortic root can be more worrisome because of its excessive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> or dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If the role of elective surgery is relatively well defined for adult patients, it is still debated during childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report two patients, aged 22 months and 5 years, each presenting an aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and each treated with the Bentall procedure without specific age-related mortality or morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These two patients experienced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> growth and were free of any complication for a follow-up period of 8 and 2 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More than an absolute value of the aortic root dimension, it is the conjunction of the rate of progression of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo>, the degree and the duration of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic valve regurgitation</z:hpo>, and its resulting left ventricular dysfunction that must be taken into consideration in choosing the surgical option </plain></SENT>
