<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We introduce a newly developed plication technique and detail its stabilizing effect on the mitral annulus after Gerbode plasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients suffered degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> with chordal rupture restricted to the middle scallop of the posterior leaflet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between 1986 and 1997, 102 patients underwent Gerbode plasty with or without annular reinforcement with a pericardial strip or modified Paneth plasty (group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean (+/- SD) follow up was 70.4 +/- 41.1 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since 1996, 32 patients have undergone a newly developed annuloplasty technique (group N), where a pericardial strip was tightly anchored to the bilateral trigones and posterior annulus, which was folded by Gerbode plasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With the final anchoring suture the intention was to prevent plication breakdown of this portion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean follow up for this group was 17.6 +/- 7.1 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> after surgery in both groups was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In group C, postoperative progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral valve regurgitation</z:hpo> occurred in 41.1% of patients (5.9% to grade 1, 17.6% to grade 2, 17.6% to grade 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among these patients, reoperation was due to plication breakdown of the Gerbode plasty in six cases (5.9%), and to either chordal rupture or annular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> in 10 cases each (9.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no reoperation due to recurrent severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> was needed in group N </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> after surgery was seen in six patients (two to grade 1; four to grade 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The newly developed annuloplasty technique may be useful in stabilizing the mitral annulus after Gerbode plasty </plain></SENT>
