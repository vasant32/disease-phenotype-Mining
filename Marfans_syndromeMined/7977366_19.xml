<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe here the identification of defined mutations in both alleles of the fibrillin gene (FBN1) in a compound-heterozygote <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) child who had a very severe form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> at the age of 4 mo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The nonconsanguineous parents were both affected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The father's heterozygous point mutation has earlier been reported to result in W217G substitution, the mother was here shown to carry a heterozygous point mutation resulting in G2627R substitution, and the child had inherited both these mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mutant FBN1 alleles were demonstrated to be transcribed with equal efficiency compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alleles, but metabolic labeling of fibroblast cultures from the child and both parents showed reduced biosynthesis and secretion of profibrillin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, the respective amounts of fibrillin in cell-culture media and extracellular-matrix extracts were markedly diminished, particularly in the cell cultures from father and child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, immunofluorescence analysis of the cell cultures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three family members revealed a drastically reduced amount of microfibrils, and virtually no visible fibrils could be seen in the case of the compound-heterozygote child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate incomplete dominance of fibrillin mutations and underline the fatal consequences of the complete absence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fibrillin molecules in the microfibrils </plain></SENT>
