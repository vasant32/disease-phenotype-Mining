<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Snoring and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> are a frequent problem not only in adults, but also in children and adolescents, as can be seen from current epidemiological data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e>) in adults have been adequately established on the basis of evidential data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a result of this, both physicians and the public are increasingly aware of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e> in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although there are numerous parallels between pediatric and adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e>, the situation in children differs that in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is a greater variety of symptoms in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e>, diagnosis is often more difficult with serious consequences for growth and development of children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e> in children is also different from that of the adult patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There are many possible causes for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These include <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the tonsils and syndromes such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031880" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pickwickian syndrome</z:e>, Prader-Willi syndrome or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e> can, however, also be the result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, midfacial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, retro- or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000347'>micrognathia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003193'>allergic rhinitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological data presented in the literature concerning the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e> in children is extremely varied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This wide range is probably due to the fact that snoring may be misdiagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e> in children may only be made by considering clinical history (such as rate of growth, tendency to fall asleep during the day, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbances</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002719'>susceptibility to infection</z:hpo>, etc.), polysomnography (if possible during several nights) and accompanying instrumental diagnosis including cephalometry or laryngoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One of the problems of polysomnography in childhood is that performance and interpretation of the results have not yet been standardized or evaluated for different age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Treatment depends on the cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e> and require multidisciplinary management involving the pediatrician, pediatric or adolescent psychiatrist, ear, nose, and throat specialist, maxillofacial surgeons, and neurosurgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Adenotonsillectomy (ATE) is the therapy generally chosen if the child has adenoidal vegetations and/or tonsillar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Corrective surgery is possible for rare malformation syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Nocturnal masks for continuous positive airway nasal pressure or procedures for mask respiration are effective in children, but are only used in exceptional cases, such as when ATE is contraindicated or when symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e> remain after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The success of pharmacological treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e> in children has not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials </plain></SENT>
