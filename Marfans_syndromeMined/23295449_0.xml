<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The proper treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta is still under debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe the early and late outcomes after composite replacement (CR), supracommissural aortic replacement (SCR) and aortic valve-sparing (AVS) operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five hundred and fourty-eight patients were operated on for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> from 1994 until 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and ninety-eight (54%) patients had CR, 154 (28%) underwent SCR, 96 (18%) received AVS using David's technique [83 (15%); after October 2006] and 13 (3%) using Yacoub's technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average size of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> was 5.8 ± 1.3 cm and differed between groups (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in the SCR group were older (P &lt; 0.001), and male gender was less frequent in the Yacoub group (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> was present more often in the AVS group (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Times for operation, extracorporeal circulation and aortic cross-clamping differed significantly (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the SCR group, 40% of patients additionally underwent aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rethoracotomy for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was required in 33 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, 30-day mortality was 4.8% and did not differ between groups (SCR = 7.2%, CR = 4.8%, David's technique = 0% and Yacoub's technique = 8.3%; P = 0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six patients experienced cerebral accidents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The follow-up was complete for 93%, and mean follow-up time was 3.9 ± 3.9 (0-17.8) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significantly reduced long-term survival for women (log-rank P = 0.0052) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Reoperation on the aortic root was necessary in only 6 patients from the Yacoub and SCR groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>By uni- or multivariate regression analysis, age and preoperative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> were risk factors for 30-day mortality, and age, gender, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, New York Heart Association class and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo>, for long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four applied techniques result in low mortality and low reoperation rate and prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The David procedure yields excellent mid-term results </plain></SENT>
