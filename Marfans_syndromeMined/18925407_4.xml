<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> of a 31-year-old man, a medicolegal autopsy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Major findings were a <z:mp ids='MP_0011575'>dilated aortic root</z:mp> with a longitudinal rupture of the intima and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340643" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dissection of aorta</z:e> and right coronary artery and consequent tamponade of the pericardial sac </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo> and other skeletal deformities in combination with the histological finding of a pseudocystic medionecrosis of the aortic wall were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By sequencing of the FBN1 gene, a mutation (1622G&gt;A) leading to the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genetic counseling was recommended to the relatives who reported that the father of the deceased had died at the same age from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003496" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic rupture</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While fortunately the child of the deceased lacked this mutation, it was found in his younger sister </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of the autopsy thus enabled early diagnosis and beginning of treatment in the sister and thus a considerable statistical increase in lifespan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With this report, we want to show that medicolegal autopsies can also have medical consequences for relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We argue that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sudden and unexpected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in young persons up to 35 years an autopsy should be performed, not only to detect unnatural causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> but also to identify heritable diseases and thus aid the relatives </plain></SENT>
