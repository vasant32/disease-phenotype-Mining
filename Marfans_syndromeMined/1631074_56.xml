<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Biochemical and molecular genetic studies have recently suggested that mutations in the gene coding for fibrillin on chromosome 15 result in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, only one mutation in the fibrillin gene has been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report the results of screening 20 unrelated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients for mutations in fibrillin cDNA by the single-strand conformation polymorphism technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found two mutations, both of which appear in the heterozygote form and code for a shortened fibrillin <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first mutation is a large in-frame deletion of 366 bases of the fibrillin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, shown to result in a truncated but secreted <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> found in the fibroblast culture of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second mutation is a G-to-A transition resulting in the substitution of a stop codon for a tryptophan codon and thus predicting the premature termination of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16541">polypeptide chain</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We screened 60 other, unrelated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients for these mutations as well as for the previously reported mutation (arginine-239 to proline) and found none of the three mutations in any of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> families carry their own distinct mutation </plain></SENT>
