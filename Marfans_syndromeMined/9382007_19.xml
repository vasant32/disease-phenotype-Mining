<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cardiac surgery performed from 1991 to 1994 in a unit dedicated specifically for grown-up congenital heart (GUCH) patients was reviewed to determine the frequency of various procedures, incidence of first and reoperations, early mortality, and its determinants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 295 patients, aged 16 to 77 years (31 +/- 13), had 307 operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First operations (n = 128, 42%) were most commonly for closure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> (n = 40), aortic valve replacement (n = 31) or repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001680'>aortic coarctation</z:hpo> (n = 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reoperations were more frequent (n = 179, 58%) and divided among first corrective repair (n = 49), reoperation after corrective repair (n = 115), and further palliation (n = 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First corrective surgery was mainly for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic valve disease</z:e> (n = 17), Fallot (n = 7), and lesions needing a Fontan procedure (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reoperations after corrective repair were needed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic valve disease</z:e> (n = 43), right-sided conduit (n = 30), or recoarctation (n = 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early mortality was influenced by presence of central <z:hpo ids='HP_0000961'>cyanosis</z:hpo> (9 of 49, 18% in <z:mp ids='MP_0001575'>cyanotic</z:mp> patients; 12 of 258, 5% in acyanotic; p &lt;0.001), increased number of previous operations (0 = 4%, 1 = 7%, 2 = 11%, &gt;2 = 13%; p = 0.003), and increasing age of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001575'>Cyanotic</z:mp> patients had more serious postoperative complications: pleural and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusions</z:hpo>, severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, and their hospital stay was longer compared with acyanotic patients (20 +/- 17 vs 11 +/- 8 days; p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In GUCH patients, reoperations cause the largest demand on cardiac surgical services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased survival of patients with complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>cardiovascular malformations</z:hpo> brings difficult challenges not only to cardiologists but also to cardiovascular surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There is a need to provide continued highly specialized care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Resources, patients, and funding should be concentrated in a few designated centers </plain></SENT>
