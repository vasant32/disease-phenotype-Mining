<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reconstruction of the visceral arteries was performed using an island technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, approximately 3 years after the operation, the reconstructed part of the aorta containing the visceral arteries became dilated and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have succeeded both in repairing the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and "re-reconstructing" the visceral arteries using a branched graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the technique of separate revascularization is worth considering from the beginning, even if the patient does not present with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
