<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The extracellular matrix protein fibrillin-1 is a major component of elastic microfibrils, which are complex assemblies of several proteins and are found in most connective tissues, frequently associated with elastin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin-1 contains 43 precursor epidermal growth factor-like (pEGF) domains that have a consensus sequence for calcium binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The calcium binding potential of a fibrillin-1 pepsin fragment (PF2) was quantitatively analyzed using microvolume equilibrium dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">Peptide</z:chebi> sequence data and pepsin fragment size determination indicate that PF2 contains seven pEGF domains, each with the calcium binding consensus sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Scatchard plot analysis of the calcium binding data shows that PF2 has six to seven high affinity binding sites with a Kd = 250 microM at pH 7.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is a second overlapping consensus sequence in the pEGF domains for beta-hydroxylation of a specific Asp/Asn residue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five partially hydroxylated Asn residues have been identified by protein sequence analysis of fibrillin-1 fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first demonstration of this modification in a connective tissue protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The calcium binding consensus sequence also contains a conserved Ser residue with an apparently novel modification, which causes the Ser residue to behave like an Asp residue during protein sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heritable disorder</z:e> of connective tissue, is known to be associated with mutations in the FBN1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most of these mutations have been found in pEGF domains, frequently substituting Cys for another amino acid, destroying the pEGF motif secondary structure along with its calcium binding potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Other mutations cause the substitution of single amino acids in the calcium binding consensus sequence, which could affect calcium binding but also the hydroxylation of Asp/Asn residues or the modification of Ser residues </plain></SENT>
