<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study is the first to delineate these symptoms in a non-selected population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neuromuscular involvement was evaluated in 10 Marfan patients through a standardized questionnaire, physical examination, nerve conduction study (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>), needle electromyography (EMG), muscle ultrasound, laboratory investigation, and muscle biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Existing neuroimages were screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> and spinal meningeal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty healthy controls with similar age distribution completed the questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that various neuromuscular symptoms occur more frequently in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four older patients reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo>, five patients had a mild-to-moderate reduction in vibration sense, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> older patients mentioned mild functional impairments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> showed axonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> in four and EMG myopathic and neurogenic changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased echo intensity and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> on muscle ultrasound was found in more than half of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsies obtained in two patients showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathic changes</z:hpo> in the older, female patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the majority of Marfan patients exhibited neuromuscular symptoms characterized as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> or both, and signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0154738" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lumbosacral radiculopathy</z:e>, with symptoms being most pronounced in the older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although meriting corroboration, these findings indicate a need to further the awareness of neuromuscular involvement in this population </plain></SENT>
