<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors reviewed 4,212 charts of patients evaluated between July 1981 and February 1995 by the Division of Genetics and Dysmorphology at the University of Kentucky Chandler Medical Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each patient's chart was categorized by diagnosis, and tables were generated to determine the most common diagnoses in the following groups: (1) multiple congenital anomaly syndromes, (2) teratogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embryopathies</z:e>, (3) chromosome anomalies, (4) isolated malformations, and (5) bone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common multiple congenital anomaly syndromes were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015923" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FAE|ARBD">Fetal alcohol syndrome</z:e> and infants of diabetic mothers were the most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embryopathies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002414'>Spina bifida</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002435'>meningocele</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009929'>myelomeningocele</z:mp>) was by far the most common isolated birth defect, followed by <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp>/ palate and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Achondroplasia</z:e> was the most common bone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data support a number of previous assumptions including the universally high frequency of syndromes like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data also give credence to what was previously thought, but unproven, to be a high incidence of diabetic and alcohol <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embryopathies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The latter (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015923" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FAE|ARBD">fetal alcohol syndrome</z:e>) has increased in frequency tremendously over the past 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is undoubtedly due in part to the overall increased awareness of the diagnosis in the medical community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, it may also be due to the increased use of alcohol among Kentucky women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Other "rare" disorders, like diastrophic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, seem to be unusually the diagnosis in the medical community </plain></SENT>
