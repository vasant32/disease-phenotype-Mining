<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the frequency of morphologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001679'>abnormalities of the aorta</z:hpo>, especially of the media, in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta, tissue specimens from surgically resected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> of 339 patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Included were 232 men and 107 women; 53 (29 men, 23 women) had clinical signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Features evaluated and graded included fragmentation of elastic fibers, cystic medial change, medial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, periaortic <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, and thickening of the vasa vasorum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both elastic fragmentation and cystic medial change were present in a high percentage of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cystic medial change was inversely correlated with increasing age of patients, especially in the group of patients without clinical evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Marked changes of these types in many younger patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> could reflect a "tissue insufficiency" in early life that causes the aortic wall to weaken and dilate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were directly correlated with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic events are considered to initiate injury and repair within the aortic wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dissection was more frequently seen with medial abnormalities than with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
