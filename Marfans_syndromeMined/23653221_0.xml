<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000563'>Keratoconus</z:hpo> (KC) is an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015397" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">eye disease</z:e> characterized by the progressive thinning and protrusion of the cornea, which results in the loss of visual acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This disorder remains poorly understood, although recent studies indicate the involvement of genetic and environmental factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, we have found that the distribution of the cross-linking enzyme <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32568">lysyl</z:chebi> oxidase (LOX) is markedly decreased in about 63 % of keratoconic specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similarly, LOX activity is significantly reduced by 38 % compared to control tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nearly 70 systemic disorders have been reported in association with KC, most of them affecting the extracellular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this review we attempted to ascertain whether any KC-associated diseases exhibit signs that may reflect LOX impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that very similar changes in the extracellular matrix, particularly at the level of collagen metabolism, including LOX impairment in mitral leaflets, may reflect an association between KC and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this putative association is supported by the high frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> in both diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among other disorders that have been found to coincide with KC, we did not find any in which the LOX enzyme may be directly or indirectly impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in cases where KC is present along with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e> and others), KC may not arise as a localized manifestation, but rather may be induced as the result of a more complex <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
