<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the 23 patients suffered from annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> (AAE) which was treated by composite graft replacement, 10 of these patients had a concomitant replacement of the aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The operative mortality rate was 8.7%, and the causes were associated with the methods of coronary artery reattachment to the graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 15 patients with the extensive type dissection, there were 11 patients who had a non-thrombotic communicating false lumen in the untreated segments of the distal dissected aorta after the first operation and from this group there were seven patients who had anastomotic leakage around the distal suture line of the graft replacement that was demonstrated by aortography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Extensive graft replacement ranging from the entire thoracic aorta to the total aorta were performed in 10 (43.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred in three patients (13.0%) and these causes were LOS and graft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> after the second operation and prosthetic valve endcarditis 6 months after the first operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present data indicate that Stanford type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> should be undertaken on the basis of a prior achievable plan to perform an entire aortic replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The dissection should also be performed using a procedure which doesn't leave distal anastomotic leakage </plain></SENT>
