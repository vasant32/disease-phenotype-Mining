<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="EDS2">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type II</z:e> (family E) and type VI (family M), the maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) of fibronectin receptor was significantly decreased to 2.2 to 2.9 x 10(3) sites/cell (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range 6.3 +/- 1.5 x 10(3) sites/cell) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Bmax values of healthy members of their families were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or moderately decreased to 3.8 to 5.1 x 10(3) sites/cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268362" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteogenesis imperfecta type III</z:e> (family K) the Bmax was significantly decreased to 1.1 x 10(3) sites/cell, but healthy members of his family had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Bmax values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (family A) the Bmax was decreased to 4.3 x 10(3) sites/cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dissociation constant of the fibronectin receptor was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some healthy members of the families of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e> had moderately decreased Bmax values, suggesting that they are carriers of an abnormal gene causing this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that fibronectin receptor is closely related to the pathogenesis of hereditary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
