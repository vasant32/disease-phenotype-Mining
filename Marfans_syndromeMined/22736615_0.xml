<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To describe the genotype-phenotype relationship of a cohort of consecutive patients with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> (EL) secondary to ADAMTSL4 and FBN1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients underwent detailed ocular, cardiovascular, and skeletal examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was correlated with Sanger sequencing of ADAMTSL4 and FBN1 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen patients were examined, including one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> et pupillae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography and skeletal examination revealed no sign of systemic disorders associated with EL, in particular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (52.9%) were found to have mutations in ADAMTSL4, including four novel nonsense mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients (25%) were found to have novel FBN1 mutations, not previously reported as causing classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One additional patient was found to have an FBN1 mutation previously reported in classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients (25%) were found to have no mutations in either gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median age of diagnosis of EL was 35 years in patients with FBN1 mutations and 2 years in patients with ADAMTSL4 mutations (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean axial length was 22.74 mm (95% confidence interval [CI]: 21.3-24.2) (FBN1) and 27.54 mm (95% CI: 24.2-30.9) (ADAMTSL4) (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Other ophthalmic features, including corneal thickness and power, foveal thickness, visual acuity, and direction of <z:mp ids='MP_0005263'>lens displacement</z:mp>, were similar for both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ADAMTSL4 is the most important known causative gene in isolated EL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mutations in ADAMTSL4 appear to cause earlier manifestation of EL and are associated with increased axial length as compared to FBN1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We suggest that ADAMTSL4 be screened in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with isolated EL and that physicians be vigilant for the more severe ocular phenotype associated with mutations in this gene </plain></SENT>
