<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We reviewed a consecutive series of 90 patients undergoing concomitant resection of ascending aortic anerysm and aortic valve replacement (AVR) utilizing noncomposite "conventional" techniques in order to assess the early and late results, to define limitations of this operative approach, and thereby to clarify the indications for composite reconstruction of the aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 55 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty percent had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, and 13% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was dissection in 13% of cases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> in 11%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in 9%, and degeneration (with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0392775" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cystic medionecrosis</z:e>) in 67% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up averaged 3.8 years and extended to 11.5 years maximum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AVR and complete excision of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (preserving <z:hpo ids='HP_0000171'>small tongues</z:hpo> of aortic wall circumscribing the coronary artery ostia) coupled with tubular graft replacement of the ascending aorta were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nineteen percent of patients required individual technical modifications relating to the coronary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Operative mortality rate was 13%, with the majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> being due to cardiac causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Contemporary (1975 to 1978) operative mortality rate was 4.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven percent required re-exploration for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and 2.4% had perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Late functional results were generally good (average N.Y.H.A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Class 1.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> occurred at linearized rates of 3.4% per patient-year, 4.9% per patient-year, 1.1% per patient-year, and 5.2% per patient-year, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No prosthetic valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, graft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, or recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the aortic root were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Late reoperation was necessary in eight patients (3% per patient-year), but reoperation for disease confined to the ascending aorta accounted for only three of these cases (1.1% per patient-year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Overall actuarial survival rates were 67% +/- 5% at 5 years and 50% +/- 9% at 10 years; survival rates for the 78 operative survivors were 77% +/- 5% and 57% +/- 10% at the same time intervals, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Only one late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> could be attributed to complications arising in the reconstructed aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These results confirm that such simple, noncomposite techniques are safe, portend minimal risk of late complications and the attendant necessity for reoperation, and provide satisfactory long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>We believe that composite techniques should be primarily reserved for selected cases of advanced necrotizing prosthetic or natural <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
