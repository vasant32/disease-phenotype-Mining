<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyze growth patterns and generate growth charts for persons with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From the charts of 180 clinically diagnosed Marfan patients, longitudinal height and weight measurements were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From this data, growth charts and growth velocity charts were generated for males and females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Skeletal maturation was studied by determining the Risser signs from the x-rays of 71 males and 56 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From 22 female patients, age of menarche was available and retrieved either by reviewing the charts or contacting the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean length at birth was 53 +/- 4.4 cm for males and 52.5 +/- 3.5 cm for females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean final height was 191.3 +/- 9 cm for males and 175.4 +/- 8.2 cm for females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean birth weight was 3.51 +/- 0.74 kg for males and 3.48 +/- 0.68 kg for females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The puberty-associated peak in growth velocity was 2.4 years earlier than the gender-matched general population for males with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and 2.2 years earlier for females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Age of menarche was 11.7 +/- 2 years of age, which is also early compared to the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that the growth spurt and pubertal skeletal maturation occur early in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The growth curves generated should help more accurately predict adult stature, as well as monitor progression toward it </plain></SENT>
