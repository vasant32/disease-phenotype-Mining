<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A role for fibrillin-1 in specifying tissue microenvironments has not been elucidated, even though the concept that fibrillin-1 provides extracellular control of growth factor signaling is currently appreciated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in FBN1 are mainly responsible for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>), recognized by its pleiotropic clinical features including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000098'>tall stature</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> and dissection, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each of the many different mutations in FBN1 known to cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> must lead to similar clinical features through common mechanisms, proceeding principally through the activation of TGFβ signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we show that a novel FBN1 mutation in a family with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265313" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Weill-Marchesani syndrome</z:e> (WMS) causes <z:mp ids='MP_0001200'>thick skin</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002544'>brachydactyly</z:mp> when replicated in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>WMS mice confirm that this mutation does not cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mutation deletes three domains in fibrillin-1, abolishing a binding site utilized by ADAMTSLIKE-2, -3, -6, and papilin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results place these ADAMTSLIKE proteins in a molecular pathway involving fibrillin-1 and ADAMTS-10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Investigations of microfibril ultrastructure in WMS humans and mice demonstrate that modulation of the fibrillin microfibril scaffold can influence local tissue microenvironments and link fibrillin-1 function to skin homeostasis and the regulation of dermal collagen production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hence, pathogenetic mechanisms caused by dysregulated WMS microenvironments diverge from Marfan pathogenetic mechanisms, which lead to broad activation of TGFβ signaling in multiple tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that local tissue-specific microenvironments, affected in WMS, are maintained by a fibrillin-1 microfibril scaffold, modulated by ADAMTSLIKE proteins in concert with ADAMTS enzymes </plain></SENT>
