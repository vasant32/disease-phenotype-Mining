<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential adequacy of the preparticipation screening process for detecting or increasing the suspicion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001626'>cardiovascular abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Current guidelines and requirements for implementation of preparticipation screening from each of the high school jurisdictions in the 50 states and the District of Columbia were analyzed and compared with the 1996 American Heart Association (<z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHA</z:chebi>) consensus panel guidelines on screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OUTCOME MEASURES: Items contained on preparticipation screening questionnaires; the examiners designated to perform screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight states (16%) have no approved history and physical examination questionnaires to guide examiners, including 1 state without a formal screening requirement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 43 states, several items relevant to cardiac-related problems were frequently omitted from the questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002875'>Exertional dyspnea</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo>, prior limitation from sports, family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> were included in 0% to 56% of the state forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specific cardiovascular items on physical examination were included in forms from only 5% to 37% of states, including documentation of a heart murmur, irregular heart rhythm, peripheral pulses, or stigmata of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventeen (40%) of 43 states had history and physical questionnaires judged to be most adequate with at least 9 of the 13 AHA recommendations, whereas 12 states (28%) were least adequate with 4 or less of these recommended items </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a total of 20 (40%) of the 51 states have no approved history and physical examination questionnaires, or formal screening requirement, or forms that were judged to be inadequate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition to physicians, 21 states also permit nurses or physician assistants to administer examinations, and 11 states specifically provide for practitioners with limited cardiovascular training (such as chiropractors) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Preparticipation athletic screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> with standard history and physical examination, as presently employed in US high schools, is highly dependent on the state-approved questionnaires, which frequently are abbreviated and may be inadequate; is implemented by a variety of health care workers with varying levels of expertise; and may be severely limited in its power to detect potentially lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001626'>cardiovascular abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These observations should represent an impetus for change and improvement in the preparticipation cardiovascular screening process for high school athletes </plain></SENT>
