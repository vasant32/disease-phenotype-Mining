<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The morphological <z:hpo ids='HP_0003170'>abnormality of the acetabulum</z:hpo> in patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003179'>protrusio acetabuli</z:hpo> is almost the exact opposite as in those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_64'>developmental dysplasia</z:mpath> of the hip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003179'>protrusio acetabuli</z:hpo>, the acetabulum is excessively deep, while in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_64'>developmental dysplasia</z:mpath> of the hip, the acetabulum is excessively shallow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A genetic etiology has been proposed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_64'>developmental dysplasia</z:mpath> of the hip, while the etiology of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003179'>protrusio acetabuli</z:hpo> is widely debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003179'>protrusio acetabuli</z:hpo> may represent a hitherto unidentified metabolic defect, and a possible candidate for such genetic influence is the R2726W variant of the fibrillin 1 (FBN1) gene, which segregates with isolated skeletal features of individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL/METHODS: We identified 26 patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003179'>protrusio acetabuli</z:hpo> and 45 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_64'>developmental dysplasia</z:mpath> of the hip through clinical and radiographic examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We included 95 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA from peripheral blood was used in genotyping for the FBN1 R2726W mutation using pyrosequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No mutant alleles were identified in any patients or controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The R2726W mutation is not responsible for skeletal malformation of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003179'>protrusio acetabuli</z:hpo> in our population, although there may be unidentified genetic variants in either FBN1 or other genes that control acetabular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
