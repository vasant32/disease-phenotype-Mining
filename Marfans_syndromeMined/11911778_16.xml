<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their biological importance is emphasized by the linkage of fibrillin mutations to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e>, which are associated with severe cardiovascular, ocular and skeletal defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These microfibrils have a complex ultrastructure and it has proved a major challenge both to define their structural organization and to relate it to their biological function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, new approaches have at last begun to reveal important insights into their molecular assembly, structural organization and biomechanical properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This paper describes the current understanding of the molecular assembly of fibrillin molecules, the alignment of fibrillin molecules within microfibrils and the unique elastomeric properties of microfibrils </plain></SENT>
