<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>31 patients with general disease, 14 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) and 17 with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003864" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arthritides</z:e> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Synovial fluid and blood samples were collected, and an individualized tomography of the TMJ was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Detectable levels of IL-1beta were found in 5 out of 39 synovial fluids and in 10 out of 27 plasma samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of IL-1beta in both plasma and synovial fluid was more frequent in RA patients than in the non-RA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The extension of radiographic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> was significantly greater in joints with IL-1beta than in those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both the extension of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> and grade of radiographic changes of the TMJ were greater in patients with detectable IL-1beta level of plasma than in patients without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study indicates that presence of IL-1beta in plasma and synovial fluid is related to radiographic changes of the TMJ </plain></SENT>
