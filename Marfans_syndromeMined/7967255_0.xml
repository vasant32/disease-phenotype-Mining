<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> operations were performed with the use of extracorporeal circulation and selective cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oxygenated warm blood was infused at a flow rate of 300 ml/min. via a catheter inserted proximal to the site of occlusion of the ascending aorta or replaced graft of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the beating of the heart was resumed under left venting, aortic arch was replaced using a prosthetic graft with three branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concomitant operations were reconstructions of the aortic root with composite graft (Bentall's technique) in two patients of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were easily taken off cardiopulmonary bypass and postoperative course was uneventful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We believe that shortening of the duration of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> is important if surgical results of total aortic arch replacement are to be further improved, above <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in patients at high risk for surgery, such as elderly subjects whose organ function is often compromised </plain></SENT>
