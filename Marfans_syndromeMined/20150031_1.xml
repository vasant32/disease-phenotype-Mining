<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective is to present a method for maintaining the spinal cord blood supply and our midterm results for using a tetrafurcate graft in extensive thoracoabdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> (TAAA) repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From August 2003 to October 2007, we used a tetrafurcate graft to perform repairs to TAAAs of Crawford extent II in 63 consecutive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean age of this group of patients was 39.98 +/- 10.62 years, and 46 (73%) of them were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the procedures were performed under profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> with a short interval of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T6 to T12 intercostal arteries were reconstructed as a "neo-intercostal artery" (N-IA) and were connected to an 8-mm sidearm of the graft to maintain the spinal cord blood supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Visceral arteries were joined into a patch and were anastomosed to the end of the main graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The left renal artery was anastomosed to an 8-mm sidearm or joined to the patch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other 10-mm sidearms were anastomosed to iliac arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With 100% follow-up, the early-mortality rate was 7.94% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of cerebral complications was 9.52% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Temporary <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> was observed in 2 patients, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002385'>paraparesis</z:hpo> occurred in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary complication was the most common morbidity in this group (25.40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> had N-IA artery pseudoaneurysms during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mean survival time of this group was 50.64 +/- 2.13 months, with survival rates of 92.06% after 1 year, 88.38% after 2 years, and 86.11% after 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The N-IA may play an important role in spinal cord protection, and N-IA pseudoaneurysm should be avoided in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The use of a tetrafurcate graft is a reliable method for TAAA repair, with satisfactory midterm results </plain></SENT>
