<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inclusion of the mgR mutation causes the otherwise <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> extracellular matrix <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> fibrillin-1 to be under-expressed at 15-25% of its <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level, a condition seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aortas in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> are generally less distensible and may experience dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> that lead to premature <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, yet little is known about effects on other large arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, common carotid arteries from mice heterozygous (R/+) and homozygous (R/R) for the mgR mutation were studied under biaxial loading and compared to results from <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> controls (+/+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Carotids from +/+ and R/+ mice exhibited similar biomechanical behaviors whereas those from R/R mice were slightly stiffer in the circumferential direction while dramatically different in the axial direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>That is, R/R carotids were stiffer axially and had lower in vivo axial prestretches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biaxial stress-stretch data were fit with a four-fiber family constitutive model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The fitted data yielded a lower value of an isotropic parameter for the R/R carotids, which reflects a compromised elastin-dominated amorphous matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, it appeared that changes in axial mechanical properties afforded R/R carotids a means to compensate, at least early in maturity (9 weeks of age), for the loss of an important structural constituent as they attempted to maintain structural integrity in response to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mean arterial pressures and thereby maintain mechanical homeostasis </plain></SENT>
