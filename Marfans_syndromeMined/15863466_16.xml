<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cross-sectional data on height and sitting height were collected from 14,500 children of Dutch origin in the age range 0-21 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reference SD charts were constructed by the LMS method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlations were analysed in three age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SH/H data from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and genetically confirmed hypochondroplasia were compared with height corrected SH/H references </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A positive association was observed between H <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>, SH <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>, and LL <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a negative correlation between SH/H <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> and height <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In short children with a height <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> &lt;-2 SDS, a cut-off limit of +2.5 SD leads to a more acceptable percentage of false positive results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In exceptionally tall children, a cut-off limit of -2.2 SDS can be used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, a nomogram of SH/H <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> versus H <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> can be helpful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of the height corrected cut-off lines for hypochondroplasia was 80% and for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> only 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In exceptionally short or tall children, the dependency of the SH/H ratio (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>) on height <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> has to be taken into consideration in the evaluation of body proportions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of the cut-off lines for hypochondroplasia is fair </plain></SENT>
