<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are no pathognomonic signs of SGS and diagnosis depends on recognition of a characteristic combination of anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe 14 persons with SGS and compare their clinical findings with those of 23 previously reported individuals, including two families with more than one affected individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our analysis suggests that there is a characteristic facial appearance, with more than two thirds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000316'>hypertelorism</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000494'>down-slanting palpebral fissures</z:hpo>, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000156'>high-arched palate</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000347'>micrognathia</z:hpo>, and apparently low-set and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000358'>posteriorly rotated ears</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other commonly reported manifestations include <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> in at least the neonatal period, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo>, and inguinal or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001537'>umbilical hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>intellectual impairment</z:hpo> ranges from mild to severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common skeletal manifestations in SGS were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000766'>pectus deformity</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003807'>camptodactyly</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001382'>joint hypermobility</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the skeletal signs alone is specific for SGS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study includes 14 mainly German individuals with SGS evaluated over a period of 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Given that only 23 other persons with SGS have been reported to date worldwide, we suggest that SGS may be more common than previously assumed </plain></SENT>
