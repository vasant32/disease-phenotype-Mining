<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We undertook a retrospective study of the pattern of reoperations in surgical patients with Marfan disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1985 and 2008, 83 Marfan patients (60 males, 23 females) underwent 155 aortic operations in our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection (22 type A, 6 type B), and two had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003496" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic rupture</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean age at initial operation was 32±13 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Operations included valve-sparing or Bentall aortic root repair, and ascending aorta, arch, descending thoracic, thoracoabdominal aorta, and infrarenal aortic replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one patients whose initial operation was elective (Group I) were compared with 22 patients with initial emergency surgery (Group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 81/83 patients ultimately underwent root/ascending repair: 64% initially and 36% at reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Operative mortality in Group I was 1.6% for both initial operations and reoperations vs 9.0% and 0% in Group II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant differences between Group I and Group II patients included: total reoperations (1 vs 3, p=0.05); arch operations (0 vs 1, p=0.003); descending thoracic aortic operations (0 vs 0.5, p=0.003); and total aortic segments replaced (1.6±1.0 vs 2.4±1.1, p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Survival at 5 and 10 years did not differ between Group I and II patients (87% and 71% vs 82% and 56%, p=0.19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although reoperation occurs in about half of surgical Marfan patients, reoperative mortality is low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with initial elective procedures fare better than those with initial emergency surgery: they have fewer subsequent operations, fewer aortic segments replaced, and trend toward improved survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Elective root replacement should be seriously considered in any Marfan patient with significant root <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
