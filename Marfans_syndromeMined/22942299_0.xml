<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One such condition is an abnormal proximal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Until recently, many believed that dilated, distorted or dissected proximal aortas might represent a forme fruste of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> or a continuum of aortopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although an FBN-1 mutation does not guarantee the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> it is clear however that FBN-1 mutations independently confer additional risk for many of the cardiovascular complications classically associated with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, treatment with an angiotensin receptor blocker has proven effective in reducing rates of thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> in preliminary studies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Awareness of an FBN-1 mutation then highlights the need for increased vigilance for the associated cardiovascular phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of an FBN-1 gene mutation may allow actionable interventions earlier in the natural history of the condition </plain></SENT>
