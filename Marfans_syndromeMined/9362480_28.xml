<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Here we describe the high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of a transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta)-binding protein-like (TB) domain, which comes from human fibrillin-1, the protein defective in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This domain is found in fibrillins and latent TGF-beta-binding proteins (LTBPs) which are localized to fibrillar structures in the extracellular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The TB domain manifests a novel fold which is globular and comprises six antiparallel beta-strands and two alpha-helices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An unusual cysteine triplet conserved in the sequences of TB domains is localized to the hydrophobic core, at the C-terminus of an alpha-helix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The structure is stabilized by four <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bonds which pair in a 1-3, 2-6, 4-7, 5-8 pattern, two of which are solvent exposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analyses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>-causing mutations and the fibrillin-1 cell-binding RGD site provide the first clues to the surface specificity of TB domain interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Modelling of a homologous TB domain from LTBP-1 (residues 1018-1080) suggests that hydrophobic contacts may play a role in its interaction with the TGF-beta1 latency-associated <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
