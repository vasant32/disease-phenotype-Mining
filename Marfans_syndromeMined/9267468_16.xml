<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The molecular basis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (MS), a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heritable disorder</z:e> of connective tissue, is now known to reside in mutations in FBN1, the gene for fibrillin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Classic phenotypic manifestations of MS include several <z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>skeletal abnormalities</z:hpo> associated primarily with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> of long bones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a first step towards understanding how mutations in FBN1 result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>skeletal abnormalities</z:hpo>, the developmental expression of fibrillin-1 (Fib-1) in human skeletal tissues is documented using immunohistochemistry and monoclonal antibodies demonstrated here to be specific for Fib-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At around 10-11 weeks of fetal gestation, Fib-1 is limited in tissue distribution to the loose connective tissue surrounding skeletal muscle and tendon in developing limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By 16 weeks, Fib-1 is widely expressed in developing limbs and digits, especially in the perichondrium, but it is apparently absent within cartilage matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fib-1 appears as a loose meshwork of fibers within cartilage matrix by 20 weeks of fetal gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Until early adolescence, Fib-1 forms loose bundles of microfibrils within cartilage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, by late adolescence, broad banded fibers composed of Fib-1 are found accumulated pericellularly within cartilage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because these fibers can be extracted from cartilage using dissociative conditions, we postulate that they are laterally packed and crosslinked microfibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these findings, we suggest that the growth-regulating function of Fib-1 may reside persistently within the perichondrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, the accumulation of special laterally crosslinked Fib-1 microfibrils around chondrocytes during late adolescence suggests that growth-regulating activities may also be performed by Fib-1 at these sites </plain></SENT>
