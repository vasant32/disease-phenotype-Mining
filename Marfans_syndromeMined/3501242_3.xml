<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A distinction is made between an idealized pathogenetic model, which aims to represent the disease in as much authentic detail as the present state of knowledge allows and in components that have literal interpretation, and an empirical model, which deals with those effects of the pathogenetic model that one may hope to observe clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We review a variety of empirical models distinguishable by the amount of data available on intermediate degrees of damage short of total destruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationship of damage to time is explored, and we consider the criteria and usefulness of linearization of this relationship where the diachronic ("longitudinal") data are few and extend over a comparatively short time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Every time a patient is examined, the degree of cumulative damage is assessed in each of the body systems of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus the examination will furnish a set of measurements, which is obtained on each of several examinations, taken over a period that for preference is long relative to the survival of the system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specific disorders discussed include dentition and enlargement of the aorta with age in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
