<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The David aortic valve-sparing reimplantation (AVr-D) operation is increasingly being used in patients with aortic root aneurysmal disease and pliable aortic cusps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to assess our early and medium-term outcomes with the AVr-D operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 2003 and 2011, a total of 179 patients underwent AVr-D procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean patient age was 49.7 ± 15.1 years, and 23.5% (n = 42) were females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> was present in 17.3% of patients (n = 31), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> Type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in 15.6% (n = 28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up was 100% complete and was 1.8 ± 1.6 years (0 days to 7.5 years) long </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic follow-up was performed 2.2 ± 1.5 years (0 days to 7.5 years) postoperatively and was 77% complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Early mortality was 1.1% (n = 2), with both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurring in patients with Type A dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pre-discharge echocardiography revealed no patients with &gt;2+ <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> (AI), 19.6% of patients (n = 34) with 1+ or 2+ AI and 80.4% of patients (n = 145) with trace or no AI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular end-diastolic diameters decreased significantly from 5.6 ± 0.9 to 5.1 ± 0.8 cm early postoperatively (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transvalvular maximum gradients were similar before discharge and at last follow-up (10.6 ± 5.4 vs. 10.0 ± 8.2 mmHg, P = 0.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>AI grade increased significantly over time (0.3 ± 0.4 before discharge vs. 0.5 ± 0.6 at follow-up, P = 0.01), but remained less than moderate in 93.6% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Four patients required aortic valve re-replacement during follow-up, two due to early <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> and two due to non-coronary leaflet <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> in Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Five-year freedom from aortic valve reoperation was 95.9 ± 2.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AVr-D is associated with a low mortality and morbidity rate, even in patients with Type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although a slightly higher rate of recurrent AI may be present in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, freedom from recurrent AI and reoperation remains excellent during medium-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The David operation should be considered the gold standard for patients with proximal aortic root pathology (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> or dissection) and pliable aortic cusps </plain></SENT>
