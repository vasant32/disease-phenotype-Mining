<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The Valsalva graft is a specifically designed Dacron graft that, on implantation and pressurization, generates pseudosinuses of Valsalva </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed a multicenter experience of the reimplantation procedure with the Valsalva graft in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> involving the aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 278 patients underwent valve-sparing aortic root replacement using the Valsalva graft at 4 different Italian cardiac surgery centers and were studied by clinical assessment and echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 278 patients, 220 were men (79%), with a mean age of 56 ± 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the patients, 42 (15%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, 31 (11%) had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo>, 13 (5%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, and 136 (49%) had grade 3 or 4+ <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concomitant cardiac procedures were performed in 78 patients (28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional aortic leaflet repair was necessary in 25 patients (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean crossclamp time was 120 ± 27 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 5 (1.8%) operative and 5 (1.8%) late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 52 ± 28 months (range, 2-112 months) and was 100% complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cumulative actuarial survival was 95.2% (268 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A total of 32 patients (11%) had grade 3 to 4+ <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo>, and 17 of these required late aortic valve replacement (range, 3-78 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At 10 years of follow-up, the freedom from aortic valve reoperation rate was 91%, and the rate of freedom from residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> not needing reoperation was 88% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The reimplantation type of valve-sparing procedure can be facilitated by the use of the Valsalva graft and can be performed with satisfactory perioperative and midterm results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>How an optimal root reconstruction will affect the second decade of follow-up has yet to be determined </plain></SENT>
