<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> is inherited as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> trait and displays major manifestations in the ocular, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report molecular and phenotypic profiles of skeletogenesis in tissues differentiated from human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells that carry a heritable mutation in FBN1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that, as a biological consequence of the activation of TGF-β signaling, osteogenic differentiation of embryonic stem cells with a FBN1 mutation is inhibited; osteogenesis is rescued by inhibition of TGF-β signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, chondrogenesis is not perturbated and occurs in a TGF-β cell-autonomous fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, skeletal phenotypes observed in human embryonic stem cells carrying the monogenic FBN1 mutation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> cells) are faithfully phenocopied by cells differentiated from induced pluripotent-stem cells derived independently from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patient fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results indicate a unique phenotype uncovered by examination of mutant pluripotent stem cells and further demonstrate the faithful alignment of phenotypes in differentiated cells obtained from both human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent-stem cells, providing complementary and powerful tools to gain further insights into human molecular pathogenesis, especially of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
