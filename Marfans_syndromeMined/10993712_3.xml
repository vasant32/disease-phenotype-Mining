The features include skeletal, ocular, and vascular defects, some of which are reminiscent of those found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the spectrum of clinical effects, the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo> has long been thought to involve the extracellular matrix (ECM), and the condition has been classified as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heritable disorder</z:e> of connective tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of the superficial similarities with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, we and others (Pyeritz, in McKusicks <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Heritable Disorders</z:e> of Connective Tissue, St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Louis, Mosby-Year Book Inc., 5th ed., pp 137-178, 1993; Pyeritz, in Principles and Practice of Medical Genetics, New York, Churchill Livingstone, 3rd ed., pp 1027-1066, 1997; Mudd, Levy, and Skovby, in The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Inherited Disease</z:e>, New York, McGraw-Hill Publishing Co., 7th ed., pp 1279-1327, 1995) have speculated how <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CBS deficiency</z:e> might affect fibrillin-1, the protein altered in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For example, the altered plasma concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> and/or cysteine in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CBS deficiency</z:e> may hinder fibrillin-1 synthesis, deposition, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When arterial smooth muscle cells were cultured under conditions of cysteine deficiency, fibrillin-1 deposition into the ECM was greatly diminished as revealed by immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Excessive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>, in contrast, had little, if any, effect on fibrillin-1 deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When cysteine concentrations were returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, the smooth muscle cells began to accumulate a matrix rich in fibrillin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Type I collagen, the major matrix component synthesized by these smooth muscle cells, was not reduced by low cysteine concentrations nor high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that a deficiency of cysteine and subsequent inhibition of fibrillin-1 accumulation in CBS deficient patients may be at least partly responsible for their phenotype, and suggest that maintenance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath>(e)ine levels may be an important therapeutic goal </plain></SENT>
