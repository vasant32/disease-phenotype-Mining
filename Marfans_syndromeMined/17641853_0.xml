<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients' medical records were reviewed and the clinical information was extracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to preoperative echocardiography, intraoperative assessment, and postoperative pathology, combined with clinical symptoms and signs, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic valve diseases</z:e> were divided into three categories: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> (AS), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> (AI), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> with insufficiency (AS-AI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The etiology was determined according to the macroscopic, microscopic and clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that among 70 aortic valves, patient age ranged from 6 to 18 years, with a mean of 15.4 years, and there were 56 boys and 14 girls (male: female=4:1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-four children only had pure <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic valve disease</z:e>, and the other 26 children had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic valve disease</z:e> associated with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018824" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart valve diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 5 cases of AS (7.14%), 60 cases of AI (85.71%) and 5 cases of AS-AI (7.14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The causes were congenital aortic valve malformation (32 cases, 45.71%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic disease</z:e> (28 cases, 40%), infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (7 cases, 10%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (2 cases, 2.86%), and undetermined (1 case, 1.43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that the common causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic valve disease</z:e> in order of frequency in children were congenital aortic valve malformation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic disease</z:e>, infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AI was more common in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic valve disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared with adult patients, congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> in children was often AI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Histologically, the leaflets of congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> were mainly myxomatous, <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and calcification less seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>AI was frequently found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic disease</z:e>, mostly associated with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018824" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart valve diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Macroscopic and microscopic examinations together with clinical information, echocardiographic findings and operative details were important in evaluating the etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic valve disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
