<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and dissections (TAAD) is a critical condition that often goes undiagnosed with fatal consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While majority of the cases are <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo>, more than 20% are inherited as a single gene disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most common familial <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> is <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>), which is primarily caused by mutations in fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with FBN1 mutations are at higher risk for dissection compared to other patients with similar size <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen family members were genotyped using Affymetrix-10K genechips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A genome-wide association study was carried out using an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003829'>incomplete penetrance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutation screening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> exons and exon-intron boundaries of FBN1 gene which reside near the peak Lod score was carried out by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The index case presented with agonizing substernal pain and was found to have TAAD by transthoracic echocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The family history was significant for 3 first degree relatives with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nine additional family members were diagnosed with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> by echocardiography examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The affected individuals had no syndromic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A genome-wide analysis of linkage mapped the disease gene to a single locus on chromosome 15q21 with a peak Lod score of 3.6 at fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene locus (odds ratio &gt; 4000:1 in favour of linkage), strongly suggesting that FBN1 is the causative gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No mutation was identified within the exons and exon-intron boundaries of FBN1 gene that segregated with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis identified additional mutation carriers who had previously unknown status due to borderline <z:hpo ids='HP_0005111'>dilation of the ascending aorta</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A familial non-syndromic TAAD is strongly associated with the FBN1 gene locus and has a malignant disease course often seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This finding indicates the importance of obtaining detailed family history and echocardiographic screening of extended relatives of patients with non-syndromic TAAD to improve the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In addition, association of non-syndromic TAAD with the Marfan disease gene locus poses the question whether secondary prevention strategies employed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> patients should be applied to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with familial TAAD </plain></SENT>
