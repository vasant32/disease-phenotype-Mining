<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is a remarkable degree of variability both within and between families with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and FBN1 mutations have also been found in a range of other related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> collectively termed type-1 fibrillinopathies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FBN1 mutations have been found in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the 65 exons of the FBN1 gene and for the most part have been unique to one affected patient or family </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we present the results of temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of FBN1 exons 59-65 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six mutations were identified, only one of which had been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of the six mutations were found in patients with mild phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together with other published reports, our results suggest that a sizable subset (ca </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>40%) of mutations in this region is associated with mild phenotypes characterized by the lack of significant aortic pathology, compared with about 7% in the rest of the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In two cases, mutations affecting analogous positions within one of the 43 cbEGF modules of FBN1 are associated with mild phenotypes when found in one of the 6 C-terminal modules (encoded by exons 59-63), but are associated with classic or severe phenotypes when found in cbEGF modules elsewhere in the gene </plain></SENT>
