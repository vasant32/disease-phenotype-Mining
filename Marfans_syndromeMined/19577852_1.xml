<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aetiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> (AAs) is the subject of intense clinical investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the critical points in their pathogenesis is the disruption of the balance between vascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_178'>extracellular matrix deposition</z:mpath> and degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AAs are common features in some genetically determined diseases of the connective tissue, such as Marfan and Loeys-Dietz Syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Acquired factors determining an enhanced inflammatory state of the arterial wall also play a key role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have determined the role of TGF-beta as the principal mediator of the pathogenesis of the alterations of the arterial wall homeostasis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The current medical management of any AA is mainly focused on the use of pharmacological agents that reduce hemodynamic stress of aortic wall, since <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is the major risk factor for the enlargement and rupture of the AAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, this approach is useful to reduce the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture but is far from being a comprehensive pathophysiology-based therapeutic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Drugs with the potential of reducing the action of TGF-beta, which activation and expression has been reported to have a major role in the molecular pathogenesis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, improving matrix repair, decreasing the proteolytic pattern and inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme as well as preventing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi>-induced AT1R (angiotensin type 1 receptor) activation, can represent new options in the medical therapy of AAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose that a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> and PPAR-gamma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> could be a useful adjunctive therapy in this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The new pathophysiology-based therapeutic approach, involving the pathological patterns and mechanisms leading to the rupture of the AAs, could represent an interesting additional tool in combination with the current established anti-hypertensive therapy </plain></SENT>
