<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activated PDGFRbeta undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequently interacts with various signaling molecules, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which binds to the phosphorylated tyrosine 739/750 residues in mice, and thus regulates actin polymerization and cell movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we found disorganized actin in the form of membrane ruffling and enhanced cell migration in LRP1-deficient (LRP1-/-) SMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>-like phenotypes such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tortuous aortas</z:e>, disrupted elastic layers and abnormally activated transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) signaling are present in smooth muscle-specific LRP1 knockout (smLRP1-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate the role of LRP1-regulated PI3K activation by PDGFRbeta in atherogenesis, we generated a strain of smLRP1-/- mice in which tyrosine 739/750 of the PDGFRbeta had been mutated to phenylalanines (PDGFRbeta F2/F2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was significantly reduced in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> in these mice compared to smLRP1-/- animals that express <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> PDGFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> actin organization was restored and spontaneous SMC migration as well as PDGF-BB-induced chemotaxis was dramatically reduced, despite continued overactivation of TGFbeta signaling, as indicated by high levels of nuclear phospho-Smad2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Our data suggest that LRP1 regulates actin organization and cell migration by controlling PDGFRbeta-dependent activation of PI3K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TGFbeta activation alone is not sufficient for the expression of the Marfan-like vascular phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, regulation of PI3 Kinase by PDGFRbeta is essential for maintaining vascular integrity, and for the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
