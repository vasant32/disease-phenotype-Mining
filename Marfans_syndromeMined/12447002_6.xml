<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Aortic compliance is defined as the relative change in aortic cross-sectional area divided by the change in arterial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a useful imaging modality for the noninvasive evaluation of aortic compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, manual tracing of the aortic contour is subject to important interobserver variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To estimate the aortic compliance from cine-MRI, a method based on fuzzy logic theory was elaborated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven healthy volunteers and eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> were examined using an ECG gated cine-MRI sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aorta was imaged in the transverse plane at the level of the pulmonary trunk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A method based on fuzzy logic was developed to automatically detect the aortic contour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Through our robust automatic contouring method, the calculation of aortic cross-sectional areas allows an estimation of the aortic compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The aortic compliance can be obtained from a fuzzy logic based automatic contouring method, thereby avoiding the important interobserver variation often associated with manual tracing </plain></SENT>
