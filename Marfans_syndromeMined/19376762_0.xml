<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>Pectus excavatum</z:hpo> (PE) is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital deformity</z:e> essentially responsible for an unattractive aspect, much more rarely for compression problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The classical treatments consist either in filling the excavation or in open thoracic reconstruction (the Ravitch technique) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, the treatment described by Nuss raises the sternum with a retrosternal metallic bar placed under thoracoscopic guidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present the preliminary results of a series of 25 children operated on using this technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HYPOTHESIS: The minimally invasive procedure described by Nuss is a valid surgical strategy to treat PE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients were operated on between February 2004 and April 2007 by the same surgeon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nineteen of these patients presented a purely cosmetic indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The six other patients were considered to have a more severe form of PE, with cardiorespiratory repercussions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this group, there were two cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and two patients presenting a history of previous cardiothoracic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The technique has always consisted in placing a retrosternal bar through two lateral incisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The surgery was always performed with right lung exclusion and was guided by thoracoscopy in 21 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In four particularly severe cases, a subxiphoid approach was required, making endoscopic guidance unnecessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The severity of the lesion was evaluated by the Haller Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients had regular clinical follow-up (at three weeks, three months, and then every six months); assessment of pain, satisfaction with the cosmetic results, and perceived improvement in respiratory function were the criteria used for this follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cosmetic result was judged to be positive by 24 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>One patient was dissatisfied (because of the asymmetrical shape resulting from the use of a single implant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Five patients presented minor complications with no repercussions on the cosmetic or functional result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>One case of secondary bar displacement required revision on day 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Following this revision evolution was uncomplicated (discharge on day 7 and activities resumed at three weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Finally, the hardware was removed at a delay after implantation ranging from one to two years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>As of today, 13 patients have had their hardware removed with no complications or loss of the initial result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The original indication of the Nuss technique remains symmetrical PE in seven to 14-year-old children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The insubstantial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> makes the technique valuable in the purely cosmetic forms of the condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Based on this series, our technique has evolved toward certain adjustments depending on the severity and the etiology of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The most reported complication in the literature is secondary displacement of the bars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>This problem is easily controlled by attaching the bar to a rib </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Over the years, we have modified the implant design so as to improve its tolerance and stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In asymmetrical forms of PE, implanting two bars has provided better efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>When a major form is present or when there is a history of cardiorespiratory problems, we recommend a short subxiphoid incision to release the pleural and pericardial adherences, precluding the need for thoracoscopic guidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>With these simple adjustments, this technique gains in reliability for cosmetic indications and its use can be extended to specific forms such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235910" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">collagenosis</z:e> or postoperative deformities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic Study </plain></SENT>
