<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the prevalence, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo>, progression, and functional implications of spinal deformity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> using four different groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 113 patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, eighty-two of whom were skeletally immature, in order to characterize the alignment and function of the spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were selected from a clinic that provides total care with no bias toward the presence of orthopaedic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>Scoliosis</z:hpo> was identified in fifty-two of the eighty-two patients, and the prevalences for the sexes were equal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The thoracic portion of the curve was convex to the right in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> was greater than that in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five distinct sagittal profiles were identified on the basis of whether the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002942'>thoracic kyphosis</z:hpo> was within, greater than, or less than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits and whether the transition between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003307'>lordosis</z:hpo> occurred at or caudad to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level or whether the curves were reversed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003302'>Spondylolisthesis</z:hpo> was present in five patients (6 per cent), with a mean slip of 30 per cent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fourteen pedigrees were studied in depth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no familial pattern of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A separate group of fifty-six patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, for whom serial follow-up radiographs were available, was studied for progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients who had a curve of more than 30 degrees had mild progression, and those who had a curve of more than 50 degrees had marked progression (mean, 3 +/- 4 degrees per year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pain and function of the back were studied in thirty patients who were thirty-five to forty-five years old; these patients were found to be more impaired than matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> was associated with pain in the region of the curve in these patients </plain></SENT>
