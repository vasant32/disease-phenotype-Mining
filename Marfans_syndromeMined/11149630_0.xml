<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study was performed to evaluate the protocols of electron beam tomographic angiography and three-dimensional reconstruction for assessing the diagnostic value of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Retrospective and comparative study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS: University hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Between 1996 and 1998, 189 cases who underwent electron beam tomographic angiography and diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic diseases</z:e> were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with surgical and pathological findings in 68 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electron beam tomographic angiography was used single-slice-scanning with ECG-triggering for screening of the thoracic aorta, continuous-volume-scanning, permitted by continuous X-ray exposure with table incremention, was performed for the abdominal aorta scanning without ECG-triggering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional reconstructions were performed with shaded-surface display, multiplanar reformatting and/or maximum intensity projection methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Electron beam tomography angiography with ECG-triggered sections of single-slice-scanning improved the image quality of the ascending aorta without motion artifacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Continuous-volume-scanning was suitable for screening of the abdominal aorta because of minimizing exposure time (10-14 sec) and saving contrast media (total contrast material of 45.5+/-6.6 ml was needed) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One hundred eighty-nine cases were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (97 cases), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> (26 cases), pseudoaneurysm (8 cases), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (39 cases), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu</z:e>'s <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> (5 cases) and congenital aortic malformations (14 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Electron beam tomography results were compared with the findings of surgery (as gold standard) in 68 cases, the diagnostic accuracy was 97% (2 cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> were erroneously diagnosed with pseudoaneurysm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Electrocardiographically triggered, contrast-enhanced electron beam tomography is feasible for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> kinds of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic diseases</z:e>, with excellent three-dimensional images competitive in quality with conventional selective aortic angiography or digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
