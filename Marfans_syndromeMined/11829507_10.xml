<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>-causing mutation, N2144S, which removes a calcium ligand in cbEGF32, does not detectably affect fibrillin-1 biosynthesis, rate of secretion, processing, or deposition of reducible fibrillin-1 into the ECM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the residue at position 2144 is normally engaged in calcium ligation, it is unable to mediate intermolecular interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have shown previously that this mutation does not affect the folding properties of the TB or cbEGF domains in vitro, but does decrease calcium-binding in cbEGF and TB-cbEGF domain constructs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we use NMR spectroscopy to probe the effects of the N2144S mutation on backbone dynamic properties of TB6-cbEGF32 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the backbone (15)N relaxation data of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> TB6-cbEGF32 has revealed a flexible inter-domain linkage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Parallel dynamics analysis of the N2144S mutant has shown increased flexibility in the region joining the two domains as well as in the calcium-binding site at the N terminus of cbEGF32 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This research demonstrates that a small change in <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> backbone flexibility, which does not enhance proteolytic susceptibility of the domain pair, is associated with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Flexibility of the TB-cbEGF linkage is likely to contribute to the biomechanical properties of fibrillin-rich connective tissue microfibrils, and may play a role in the microfibril assembly process </plain></SENT>
