<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, there have been no reports concerning abdominal visceral findings in this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of abdominal visceral findings in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Computed tomography or magnetic resonance studies of 69 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and an age- and sex-matched cohort of control subjects were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of abdominal visceral findings was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chi-square and Student t tests were used to determine significance of differences between the patient and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study was approved by the local institutional review board and determined to be exempt from Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act reporting requirements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000107'>Renal cysts</z:hpo> were present in 41 Marfan patients (59.4%) versus 21 control subjects (30.4%), P=0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000107'>renal cysts</z:hpo> was greater in Marfan patients than controls (2.4 vs. 0.9, P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001407'>Hepatic cysts</z:hpo> were present in 24 Marfan patients (34.8%) versus 12 control patients (17.3%), P=0.02 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The average number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001407'>hepatic cysts</z:hpo> was also greater in Marfan patients than controls (0.9 vs. 0.3, P=0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>Cholelithiasis</z:hpo> was present in 12 Marfan patients (18.1%) versus one control patient (1.5%), P&lt;0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> patients have liver and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000107'>renal cysts</z:hpo> more often, in increased number, and at an earlier age than controls, in addition to an increased prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>cholelithiasis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further study will be needed to relate these findings to recent developments concerning the underlying molecular genetics of this disorder </plain></SENT>
