<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Beta-blockade has been advocated as preventive therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> based on reports indicating a decreased rate of aortic root dilation in treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (n = 63) followed at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh or Children's Hospital of New York-Presbyterian who had &gt; or =18 months of echocardiographic follow-up were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> clinical data and 213 serial echocardiograms were reviewed, and aortic root dimensions were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into 2 groups for comparison: untreated (n = 34) and treated (n = 29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At study entry, the 2 study groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, body surface area (BSA), aortic root measurements, heart rate, and corresponding z scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up duration in each group was similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At last follow-up, heart rates and heart rate z scores were lower in the treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rates of change of aortic root measurements (P = .52) and the corresponding z scores were not statistically different between the 2 group at the study's end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that that beta-blocker therapy does not significantly alter the rate of aortic root dilation in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on these data, the recommendation of lifetime beta-blocker therapy instituted during childhood should be reassessed </plain></SENT>
