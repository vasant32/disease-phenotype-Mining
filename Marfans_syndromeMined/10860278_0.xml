<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The treatment of annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> in patients, including those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004933'>ascending aortic dissection</z:hpo>, and other disorders of the ascending aorta and aortic valve presents a surgical challenge that has, unfortunately, shown high hospital mortality up to now </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Improvements in graft materials and advanced surgical techniques have, however, begun to reduce hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the records of 47 consecutive patients who undergoing aortic root reconstruction using the Carrel patch between January 1991 and March 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postoperative complications included myonephrotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> caused by femoral artery cannulation in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reexploration was done to halt <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 1 of 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection patients, retrograde filling of the false lumen was demonstrated postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall surgical mortality in this series was 2.1% (1 of 47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cardiac-event free rate was 98% at 5 years and 88% at 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Actual survival is 97.8% at 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No anastomosis complications were seen during follow-up (average: 32.7 months) (about 2.73 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Surgery is considered feasible in any anatomic variation of aortic root disease, even in coronary ostial minimal dislocation, and the Carrel patch holds hope in preventing of anastomotic pseudaneurysm and ensuring long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our experience suggests that modified Bentall operation, or aortic root remodeling using the Carrel patch, has few late-term complications, even in Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
