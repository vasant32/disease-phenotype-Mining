<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At 21 weeks of pregnancy, routine fetal ultrasounds showed the presence of apparently isolated bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001762'>club feet</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fetal karyotyping documented an interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5: 46,XX,del(5) (q15q31) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 50 analyzed metaphases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because such deletion is associated with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>psychomotor retardation</z:hpo>, the pregnancy was terminated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postmortem karyotyping of skin fibroblasts confirmed the presence of this interstitial de novo deletion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mitoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The breakpoints on 5q were analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization and were localized at 5q15 and q31.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This case illustrates the importance of fetal karyotyping in cases of isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001762'>club feet</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At autopsy, the fetus presented had minor anomalies and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo> of knee and hip joints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These clinical findings could fit the diagnosis of congenital contractural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo> (CCA) or Beals syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CCA is caused by a defect in the fibrillin-2 (FBN2) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This gene was previously mapped on 5q23-31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our molecular studies of both parents and the fetus, using an intragenic polymorphic GT repeat, showed that the FBN2 gene was deleted in the fetus and that the de novo interstitial deletion occurred on the paternally inherited chromosome 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, CCA may be caused by a loss of function of the FBN2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Clinical findings in this fetus and those of other described cases with interstitial 5q deletions are reviewed, and similarities with CCA are stressed </plain></SENT>
