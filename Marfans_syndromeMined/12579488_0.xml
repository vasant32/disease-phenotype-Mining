<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze fibrillin-1 (FBN(1)) gene mutation in Chinese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>(<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) and to make a gene diagnosis by haplotype analysis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> families were analysed with single strand conformation polymorphism(SSCP) and DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the use of four primers designed in the flanking sequences of each short-sequence tandem-repeat region in FBN(1) gene, the haplotype-segregation analysis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>(B) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>(A)II(1), PCR-SSCP detected SSCP band alterations in exon 25 of FBN(1) gene; direct sequencing showed a small 13bp deletion, the deleted sequence being gcctctgcaccca at base 3243-3456 of cDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This mutation caused a frame-shift which was never seen in any unaffected members of the family, and it was a heterozygous mutation; neither of them was identified in 100 chromosomes from 50 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Haplotype-segregation analysis suggested that the disease was passed from Subject I(2) to Subject II(2), Subject II(3), Subject II(5) with the same allele in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> B family, the proband's daughter also inherited the allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicated that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>(B) family was linked to FBN(1) gene, the proband's daughter was an asymptomatic patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The combination of mutation analysis and haplotype analysis can provide more evidence for gene diagnosis </plain></SENT>
