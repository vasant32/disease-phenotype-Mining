<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of angiotensinogen (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e>) M235T, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) I/D and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> type 1 receptor (AT1R) A1166C polymorphisms in influencing the susceptibility to classic or non-classic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> in Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 135 Marfan patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, diagnosed by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e>, ACE, and AT1R polymorphisms were identified by polymerase chain reaction-based restriction analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of the ACE D, but not <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e> 235T and AT1R 1166C allele, was significantly higher in patients with classic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> in comparison to that observed in the non-classic one (p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentage of subjects with the contemporaneous presence of ACE D and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e> 235T alleles was significantly higher in the classic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> group in comparison to the non-classic one (79% vs. 55%, respectively; p=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The concomitant presence of these two alleles was associated with increased susceptibility to the classic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> (OR 3.02, p=0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show a possible role of ACE and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e> genes as predisposing factors to classic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> in Marfan patients, thus suggesting a role of renin angiotensin system genes in modulating mitral valve abnormality, and the need for an interventional study with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> type 1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>, which considers the leaflet thickness progression in Marfan patients with MVP </plain></SENT>
