<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to use transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to define the mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> (AR) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> so as to assist the surgeon in identifying patients with mechanisms of AR suitable for valve preservation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Significant AR frequently complicates <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> necessitating either aortic valve repair or replacement at the time of aortic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although direct surgical inspection can identify intrinsically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> leaflets suitable for repair, it is preferable for the surgeon to correlate aortic valve function with the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> prior to thoracotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 50 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in whom preoperative TEE findings were considered by the surgeons in planning aortic valve surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six patients did not undergo surgery (noncandidacy or refusal) and one patient had had a prior aortic valve replacement and therefore was excluded from the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients had no or minimal AR and 22 had moderate or severe AR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, there were 16 with intrinsically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> leaflets who had AR due to one or more correctable aortic valve lesion: incomplete leaflet closure due to leaflet tethering in a <z:mp ids='MP_0011575'>dilated aortic root</z:mp> in 7; leaflet <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> due to disrupted leaflet attachments in 8; and dissection flap <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> through the aortic valve orifice in 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these 16 patients, 15 had successful aortic valve repair whereas just 1 underwent aortic valve replacement after a complicated intraoperative course (unrelated to the aortic valve) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine patients underwent aortic valve replacement for nonrepairable abnormalities, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> in four, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> in four, and <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp> in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients undergoing aortic valve repair, follow-up transthoracic echocardiography at a median of three months revealed no or minimal residual AR, and clinical follow-up at a median of 23 months showed that none required aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When significant AR complicates <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, TEE can define the severity and mechanisms of AR and can assist the surgeon in identifying patients in whom valve repair is likely to be successful </plain></SENT>
