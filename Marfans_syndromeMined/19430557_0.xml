<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic dissection</z:hpo> (AoD) is one of the most common catastrophes involving the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, early diagnosis remains to be a challenge in the Emergency Department (ED), particularly in young individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we attempted to identify the characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> AoD among young individuals, particular in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was an retrospective chart-review study conducted in a tertiary referring hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hospital database was queried for the combination of AoD and patients under age of 40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The medical charts were reviewed to obtain demographic data, clinical data and laboratory characteristics by using a standardized data collection sheet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A comparison between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> patients was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the 10-years period, 18 of 344 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> AoD were younger than 40 years-old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> AoD at a younger age than patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> upon presenting to the ED than those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> had trends toward higher risk of development of type A AoD, increased recurrence rate and higher mortality rate than those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, statistical significance was not present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ED physicians should have high alert to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> AoD in young patients presenting with severe unexplained chest and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo>, particularly in those patients with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart diseases</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> or featuring <z:hpo ids='HP_0001519'>Marfanoid habitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome, unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011458'>abdominal symptoms</z:hpo>, and sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> could be the initial manifestation of AoD in young patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A low threshold to perform enhanced computed tomography may facilitate early diagnosis and timely treatment in this patient population </plain></SENT>
