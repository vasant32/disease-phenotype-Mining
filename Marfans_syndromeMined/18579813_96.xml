<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent data from mouse models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> suggest that aortic-root enlargement is caused by excessive signaling by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) that can be mitigated by treatment with TGF-beta <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi>-receptor blockers (ARBs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the clinical response to ARBs in pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> who had severe aortic-root enlargement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified 18 pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> who had been followed during 12 to 47 months of therapy with ARBs after other medical therapy had failed to prevent progressive aortic-root enlargement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ARB was <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> in 17 patients and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5959">irbesartan</z:chebi> in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the efficacy of ARB therapy by comparing the rates of change in aortic-root diameter before and after the initiation of treatment with ARBs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) rate of change in aortic-root diameter decreased significantly from 3.54+/-2.87 mm per year during previous medical therapy to 0.46+/-0.62 mm per year during ARB therapy (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The deviation of aortic-root enlargement from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, as expressed by the rate of change in z scores, was reduced by a mean difference of 1.47 z scores per year (95% confidence interval, 0.70 to 2.24; P&lt;0.001) after the initiation of ARB therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sinotubular junction, which is prone to dilation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> as well, also showed a reduced rate of change in diameter during ARB therapy (P&lt;0.05), whereas the distal ascending aorta, which does not normally become dilated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, was not affected by ARB therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a small cohort study, the use of ARB therapy in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> significantly slowed the rate of progressive aortic-root dilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings require confirmation in a randomized trial </plain></SENT>
