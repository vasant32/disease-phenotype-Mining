<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In most patients with the classical phenotype mutations are found in the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) on chromosome 15q21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is thought that most mutations act in a dominant negative way or through haploinsufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 9 index cases referred for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> we detected heterozygous missense mutations in FBN1 predicted to substitute the first aspartic acid of different calcium-binding Epidermal Growth Factor-like (cbEGF) fibrillin-1 domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A similar mutation was found in homozygous state in 3 cases in a large consanguineous family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Heterozygous carriers of this mutation had no major skeletal, cardiovascular or ophthalmological features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the literature 14 other heterozygous missense mutations are described leading to the substitution of the first aspartic acid of a cbEGF domain and resulting in a Marfan phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data show that the phenotypic effect of aspartic acid substitutions in the first position of a cbEGF domain can range from asymptomatic to a severe neonatal phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The recessive nature with reduced expression of FBN1 in one of the families suggests a threshold model combined with a mild functional defect of this specific mutation </plain></SENT>
