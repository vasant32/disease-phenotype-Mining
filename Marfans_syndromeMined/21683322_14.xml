<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Geleophysic (GD) and acromicric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (AD) belong to the acromelic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> group and are both characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>severe short stature</z:hpo>, short extremities, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001387'>stiff joints</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although AD has an unknown molecular basis, we have previously identified ADAMTSL2 mutations in a subset of GD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After exome sequencing in GD and AD cases, we selected fibrillin 1 (FBN1) as a candidate gene, even though mutations in this gene have been described in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, which is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000098'>tall stature</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified 16 heterozygous FBN1 mutations that are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> located in exons 41 and 42 and encode TGFβ-binding protein-like domain 5 (TB5) of FBN1 in 29 GD and AD cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microfibrillar network disorganization and enhanced TGFβ signaling were consistent features in GD and AD fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, a direct interaction between ADAMTSL2 and FBN1 was demonstrated, suggesting a disruption of this interaction as the underlying mechanism of GD and AD phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although enhanced TGFβ signaling caused by FBN1 mutations can trigger either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> or GD and AD, our findings support the fact that TB5 mutations in FBN1 are responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> phenotypes </plain></SENT>
