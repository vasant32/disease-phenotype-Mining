<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Cases of "non-idiopathic" <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> are deemed atypical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These require a comprehensive work-up in order to choose the best treatment (and to determine an extent of fusion if needed) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disease</z:e> often marked with the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, which is poorly described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Knowing that the clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> is not always obvious, we investigated how atypical the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> was when compared with that of adolescent idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> (AIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In our series, we included 30 patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each patient was proposed to undergo a plain radiographic examination of the spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Scoliotic patients were classified according to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>Scoliosis</z:hpo> Research Society (SRS) curve pattern classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Curve patterns with a very low rate of occurrence in historic control were defined as "atypical" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 19 patients were defined as scoliotic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 9 cases, the curve pattern was atypical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the other 10, the curve pattern was typical, but a fine analysis revealed some atypical features in the position of the apex and end vertebrae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>Scoliosis</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> was found to be atypical in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This supports the idea that an atypical curve pattern should be considered as an argument in favour of a non-idiopathic aetiology and, therefore, an appropriate work-up should be performed before deciding treatment </plain></SENT>
