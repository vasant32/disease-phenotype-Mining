<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The elastic properties of many tissues such as the lung, dermis, and large blood vessels are due to the presence of elastic fibers in the extracellular space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These fibers have been shown by biochemical and ultrastructural analysis to be comprised of two distinct components, a more abundant amorphous component and the microfibrillar component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The microfibrillar component is found in 10- to 12-nm fibrils which are located primarily around the periphery of the amorphous component but, to some extent, interspersed within it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The protein, elastin, makes up the highly insoluble amorphous component and is responsible for the elastic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elastin is found throughout the vertebrate kingdom except for very primitive fish and possesses an unusual chemical composition consonant with its characteristic physical properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elastin is composed largely of glycine, proline, and other hydrophobic residues and contains multiple lysine-derived cross-links, such as the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37628">desmosines</z:chebi>, which link the individual <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16541">polypeptide chains</z:chebi> into a rubber-like network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The intervening, hydrophobic regions of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16541">polypeptide chains</z:chebi> between the cross-links are highly mobile, and the elastic properties of the fibers can be described in terms of the theory of rubber elasticity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recent application of recombinant DNA techniques has led to further understanding of the structure of elastin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analyses of the bovine and human elastin genes have demonstrated that the hydrophobic and cross-linking domains are encoded in separate exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These exons tend to be small, varying from 27 to 114 base pairs, and are separated by large intervening sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, DNA sequence analysis has demonstrated that the elastin molecule contains two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32460">cysteine residues</z:chebi> which were not previously identified near the carboxy terminus and which may be important in the interaction of elastin with other extracellular matrix proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further DNA sequencing should determine the complete amino acid sequence of elastin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Biosynthetic studies and in vitro translation of elastin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> have demonstrated that a 72,000-dalton <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi>, designated tropoelastin, is the initial translation product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Analysis of several developing systems has demonstrated that elastin synthesis is controlled by the level of elastin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>After packaging into membrane-bound vesicles in the Golgi apparatus, tropoelastin is secreted by exocytosis into the extracellular space where it is cross-linked by a copper-requiring extracellular enzyme, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32568">lysyl</z:chebi> oxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Elastin can be solubilized only by proteases that have consequently been designated elastases, although these are general, powerful proteases that can hydrolyze numerous proteins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
