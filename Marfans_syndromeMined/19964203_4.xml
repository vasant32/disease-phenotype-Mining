<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This approach will allow improved computerized reasoning as well as a facility to compare phenotypes between different species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The PATO mapping will also provide direct links from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000118'>phenotypic abnormalities</z:hpo> and underlying anatomic structures encoded using the Foundational Model of <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>Anatomy</z:mp>, which will be a valuable resource for computational investigations of the links between anatomical components and concepts representing diseases with abnormal phenotypes and associated genes </plain></SENT>
