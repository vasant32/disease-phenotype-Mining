<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients were examined with MRI 0.5 to 200 months after surgical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The series included 15 type-I dissections, 1 type-II dissection and 5 complicated type-III dissections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images demonstrated the persistence of the intimal flap with patency of both the true and the false lumen in 17 cases, the complete obliteration of the false lumen in 1 case and the partial <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the false lumen in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coronary artery ostial reimplantation was depicted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients who underwent this kind of surgery; in 1 case, a small <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> was present at the site of reimplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients, an organized <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> was seen between the prosthetic graft and the native aortic wall; in 1 case the aortic lumen was markedly reduced, while in the extant 2 cases, signal intensity features were suggestive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> due to prosthetic graft degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients underwent two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> exams: the first one immediately after surgery (in most cases) and the second one at 3-11 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aortic diameter progressively increased in 4 patients, 3 of them with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, MRI proved an accurate technique to assess aortic size beyond the prosthetic graft and to demonstrate the residual dissecting process and the postoperative problems in the prosthetic conduit </plain></SENT>
