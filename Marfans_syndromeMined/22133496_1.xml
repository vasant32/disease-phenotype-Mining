<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Optimal management, including timing of surgery, remains debated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> because of a lack of data on aortic risk associated with this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We used our database to evaluate aortic risk associated with standardized care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients who fulfilled the international criteria, had not had previous aortic surgery or dissection, and came to our center at least twice were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aortic measurements were made with echocardiography (every 2 years); patients were given systematic β-blockade and advice about sports activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic aortic surgery was proposed when the maximal aortic diameter reached 50 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven hundred thirty-two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> were followed up for a mean of 6.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and 2 dissections of the ascending aorta occurred during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Event rate (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>) was 0.17%/y </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Risk rose with increasing aortic diameter measured within 2 years of the event: from 0.09%/y per year (95% confidence interval, 0.00-0.20) when the aortic diameter was &lt;40 mm to 0.3% (95% confidence interval, 0.00-0.71) with diameters of 45 to 49 mm and 1.33% (95% confidence interval, 0.00-3.93) with diameters of 50 to 54 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk increased 4 times at diameters ≥50 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The annual risk dropped below 0.05% when the aortic diameter was &lt;50 mm after exclusion of a neonatal patient, a woman who became pregnant against our recommendation, and a 72-year-old woman with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> remains low in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and aortic diameter between 45 and 49 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Aortic diameter of 50 mm appears to be a reasonable threshold for prophylactic surgery </plain></SENT>
