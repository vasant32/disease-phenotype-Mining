<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Mutations in the genes for transforming growth factor-beta receptor (TGFBR) have been identified in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) and Marfan-like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are several syndromes associated with mutations in TGFBR genes, including Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), MFS2, Furlong syndrome, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1321551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, with the exception of the first report by Loeys et al, the phenotypic features of patients with TGFBR gene mutations have not been precisely reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 18 patients suspected of having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> were recruited and 7 were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and mutations in FBN1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the remaining 11 patients, 1 patient had mutations in TGFBR1, 2 had mutations in TGFBR2, and 1 had mutations in COL3A1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical manifestations of the 3 patients with TGFBR gene mutations were examined according to the list of 36 clinical features described in the first report by Loeys et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical manifestations of these 3 patients differed from those previously observed in patients with MFS2, Furlong syndrome, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1321551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the most probable diagnosis of these 3 patients was LDS, despite the fact that they presented with only a fraction of the 36 clinical features associated with LDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the number of the patients was limited, the findings support the notion that mutations in the TGFBR gene may be associated with greater phenotypic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> than previously reported </plain></SENT>
