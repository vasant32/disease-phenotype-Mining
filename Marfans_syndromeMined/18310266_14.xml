<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) is usually initially based on clinical criteria according to the number of major and minor systems affected following international nosology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The number of FBN1 mutation carriers, at risk of aortic complications who would not be properly diagnosed based only on clinical grounds, is of growing importance owing to the increased availability of molecular screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to identify patients who should be considered for FBN1 mutation screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our international series included 1009 probands with a known FBN1 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified as either fulfilling or not fulfilling "clinical" criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with unfulfilled "clinical" criteria, we evaluated the percentage of additional patients who became positive for international criteria when the FBN1 mutation was considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aortic risk was evaluated and compared in patients fulfilling or not fulfilling the "clinical" international criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> was possible on clinical grounds in 79% of the adults, whereas 90% fulfilled the international criteria when including the FBN1 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Corresponding figures for children were 56% and 85%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>Aortic dilatation</z:hpo> occurred later in adults with unfulfilled "clinical criteria" when compared to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> group (44% vs 73% at 40 years, p&lt;0.001), but the lifelong risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004933'>ascending aortic dissection</z:hpo> or surgery was not significantly different in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Because of its implications for aortic follow-up, FBN1 molecular analysis is recommended in newly suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> when two systems are involved with at least one major system affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is of utmost importance in patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> and in children </plain></SENT>
