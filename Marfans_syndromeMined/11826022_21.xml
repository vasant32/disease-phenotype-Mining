<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: It has been firmly established that mutations in the gene for fibrillin 1, FBN1, cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FBN1 mutations can also cause <z:mp ids='MP_0005395'>other phenotypes</z:mp>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> (EL) and familial isolated thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> and dissection (FAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When the clinical presentation is typical, diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> is usually easy to make </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, there can be a marked phenotypic variation between affected subjects even in one family, and making the diagnosis can be challenging, especially in childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to test the sensitivity of conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) for detecting mutations in FBN1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and related phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Setting up CSGE analysis for the FBN1 gene and testing the method first by screening coded samples from 17 MFS patients with previously detected FBN1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We then used a test set consisting of 46 coded samples representing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, related phenotypes, and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen of the 17 known mutations were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Altogether 23 mutations were detected in a test set consisting of 46 coded samples representing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, related phenotypes, and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nineteen of the mutations were novel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mutation was detected in 18 of the 20 MFS patients and in one patient with familial EL, but not in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> MASS syndrome, any of the five <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> (AAE) patients, or any of the 15 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A FBN1 mutation was detected in four members of a multigeneration family with AAE, however </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that CSGE is highly sensitive for the detection of mutations in FBN1, and that molecular diagnostics is a useful means of confirming clinical diagnoses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and related disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further careful investigations are needed, however, in order to correlate the interfamilial and intrafamilial clinical variabilities of fibrillinopathies and mutations in FBN1 </plain></SENT>
