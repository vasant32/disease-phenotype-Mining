<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), we evaluated the lumbar spine L2-L4 and proximal femur bone mineral density (BMD,/cm2) in 32 women and 16 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The women were 38 +/- 10 (SD) years old (23-58 years); their mean height was 178.7 +/- 8 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The children (9 boys and girls were 9.9-17.5 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Children were tall for their ages but of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were moderately active, without previous nontraumatic fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the women, BMD was reduced at L2-L4, femoral neck (fnk), trochanter (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">tr</z:e>), and intertrochanter (intr) (p &lt; 0.0001-0.006), compared with age-predicted values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Z scores for L2-L4 and for the fnk, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">tr</z:e>, and intr, were -0.59 +/- 1.06,-1.25 +/- 0.99,-1.03 +/- 0.91, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average hip axis length (HAL) of 11.5 +/- 0.093 cm was at the 80th percentile for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant change was observed in 1 year follow-up BMD measurements in 13 women (fnk = -0.23 +/- 2.3%/year; L2-L4 = -0.43 +/- 1.57%/year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In Marfan children, BMD correlated with age, height, and pubertal development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Femoral neck BMG was reduced (Z = -0.74 +/- 1.22,p &lt; 0.05) with a nonsignificant trend toward <z:mp ids='MP_0000063'>decreased BMD</z:mp> at L2-L4 (Z = 33 +/- 1.48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Resorption markers in Marfan women were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and did not correlate with bone status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> have both axial and peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000938'>osteopenia</z:hpo> as well as an increased HAL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This combination of findings likely increases substantially their long-term risk for hip fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000938'>osteopenia</z:hpo> in Marfan children indicates that the skeletal deficits of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> may reflect inadequate bone acquisition </plain></SENT>
