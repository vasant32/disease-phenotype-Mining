<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Over the past 20 years, a series of procedures have been designed to reconstruct the aortic root of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo>, in whom the pathology and hence, the surgery, spares the valve leaflets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this current study was to evaluate our midterm results comparing the reimplantation technique with the remodeling technique in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, aortic root and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: During the years 1993 and 2006 we operated on 209 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> secondary to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the aortic root or ascending aorta with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 59 years (range 21-81 years), 69% of the patients were males; 91 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, while 118 patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> or it's form fruste </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Post-operative follow-up (FU) was 82% complete (172 patients) with mean follow-up time of 66 months, and completion of FU was continued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients underwent the reimplantation technique, 89 patients underwent the remodeling technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients underwent only replacement of the ascending aorta on the level of the STJ, 11 patients had replacement of the ascending aorta and one sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 45 of the cases bio-glue was used in addition to replacing the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, 30 days mortality was 5.7% (12 patients out of 209) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in mortality rates among the groups of patients who underwent reimplantation (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> vs <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> dissection), but significantly higher mortality rate was observed among patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and underwent the remodeling technique compared to the same group of patients who underwent reimplantation (6.7% vs 1.1%, P &lt; 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It was also found that Marfan patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> had significantly higher mortality rate when undergoing the remodeling technique (7.6% Vs 0%, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Recurrence of AI more than 2+ occurred in 11 patients, ten from the remodeling and one from the reimplantation group (P = 0.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Among Marfan patients, recurrence of AI more than 2+ occurred in two patients, both underwent remodeling and both had dissection of the ascending aorta involving the sinuses of Valsalva </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Reoperation due to Severe AI was needed for 8 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> from the remodeling group and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were non-Marfans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection reimplantation provides better haemostasis and there may be more stable repair, both in Marfan and non-Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In Marfans it seems that the reimplantation technique provides better long-term results </plain></SENT>
