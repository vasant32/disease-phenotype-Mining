<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Indirect-immunofluorescence studies of skin and cultured dermal fibroblasts from patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> demonstrate apparent deficiency of one element of connective tissue--the microfibrillar-fiber system--in assays using specific antibodies against fibrillin, a major microfibrillar protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to test whether these immunostaining abnormalities are consistent and diagnostic features of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied patients with either the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> or various other inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective-tissue disorders</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects according to a single-blind protocol in which coded samples of skin, fibroblast cultures, or both were analyzed without knowledge of the clinical diagnosis and classified as "Marfan" or "non-Marfan" before the sample codes were broken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 27 patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, 24 were correctly identified by the decreased content of microfibrillar fibers in their skin, cultured fibroblasts, or both; in contrast, 19 of 25 patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heritable disorders</z:e> of connective tissue and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 13 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects were correctly classified as "non-Marfan" by these assays (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results document consistent, relatively specific abnormalities of microfibrillar fibers in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The biomechanical incompetence of these structural elements, due to quantitative or qualitative abnormalities, may account for the pleiotropic clinical manifestations of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, various defects in the expression, structure, assembly, or degradation of the constituent structural <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi>) of microfibrils may be implicated in the causation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
