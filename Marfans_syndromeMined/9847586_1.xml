<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He had undergone replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic valve with a composite graft and reconstruction of the coronary artery by the Cabrol procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 5 years after the initial surgery he experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> and was subsequently examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography revealed a pseudoaneurysm in the ascending aorta and the residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The maximum diameter of the pseudoaneurysm was 85 mm and the maximum diameter of the aortic arch was 55 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aortic arch was associated with an aberrant right subclavian artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiography revealed that the pseudoaneurysm was caused by leakage at the coronary ostium-graft anastomoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We repaired the anastomoses and performed total aortic arch replacement with reconstruction of four arch branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The postoperative course was uneventful without any complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We report this case because there have been few reports regarding arch replacement in cases with an aberrant right subclavian artery </plain></SENT>
