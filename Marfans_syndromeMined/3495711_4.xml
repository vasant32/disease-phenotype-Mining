<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With use of our diagnostic-retrieval system, we identified 28 patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who were 32 years of age or older at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients had at least two of four major diagnostic criteria for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>--a confirmed family history, a long-limbed habitus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>dislocated lenses</z:hpo>, and disease of the aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these relatively older patients, some clinical findings (the ocular disorder and the family history) corresponded to the expected findings in younger patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>; however, the proportion of those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> was greater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography has improved the potential for detection of the cardiac lesions, the most frequent cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is important so that complications of the cardiac lesions can be prevented or delayed and so that genetic counseling can be done at an appropriate time </plain></SENT>
