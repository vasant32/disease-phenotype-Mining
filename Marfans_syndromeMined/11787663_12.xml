<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Knowing the effect body habitus can have on pulmonary function is important when there is a concern of an underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pattern of PFT abnormaLities can help distinguish an underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0231926" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ventilatory defect</z:e> as deriving from the body habitus or from a second process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are limitations, however </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Individuals who are <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and have the same weight will likely have different degrees of impairment, for instance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It then becomes difficult to predict the effect body habitus will have in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It therefore is vitally important to evaluate these patients using other clinical data to decide whether the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0231926" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ventilatory defect</z:e> can be explained by body habitus alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It also should be noted that some of the more subtle physiologic changes that occur in these conditions are still not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hopefully, further insight into these changes can be obtained with further investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Certainly, better predictors of the impact of the patient's weight, abdominal girth, and other anthropomorphic data on PFT results would be extremely helpful in the evaluation of these individuals </plain></SENT>
