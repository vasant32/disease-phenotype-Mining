<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the use of a capsule anchor to reposition and fixate the capsular bag to the scleral wall in eyes with subluxation of the crystalline lens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, Meir Medical Center, Kfar-Saba, Israel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study evaluated a 1-plane <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53205">poly(methyl methacrylate)</z:chebi> intraocular implant (Capsular Anchor) that is clipped to the anterior capsule to support it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The device is composed of a central rod located in front of the anterior capsule and 2 lateral arms positioned behind the anterior capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The anchor is secured to the sclera with a single 9-0 or 10-0 polypropylene suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A capsular tension ring (CTR) can be implanted in conjunction with the anchor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The anchor was implanted in eyes with subluxated cataractous lenses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After surgery, intraocular lens (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e>) centration and corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) were monitored for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The anchor was successfully implanted in 2 patients with traumatic subluxated lenses and 2 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 1 eye, 2 anchors were used because of zonular dehiscence that extended during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 3 eyes, an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e> was implanted in the bag and in 1 eye, in the sulcus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A CTR was additionally implanted in 3 eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>During the 12-month follow-up, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOLs</z:e> remained well centered and stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The CDVA improved to 20/20 to 20/25 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The capsule anchor was effective in fixating the lens capsule to the scleral wall in cases of significant zonular dehiscence </plain></SENT>
