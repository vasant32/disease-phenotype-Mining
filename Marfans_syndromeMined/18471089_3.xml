<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, two Chinese families were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients in family 1 were well characterized with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, while those in family 2 displayed Marfan-like disorders such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> (EL) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001519'>marfanoid habitus</z:hpo>, but did not develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to analyze the pathogenic mutations and their relationships with phenotypes in these two Chinese families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants underwent complete physical, ophthalmic, and cardiovascular examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 65 exons and flanking intronic sequences of FBN1 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and screened for mutations by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hundred and fifteen unrelated controls were analyzed using the same methods to confirm the mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In family 1, we identified the mutation p.C499S in the calcium-binding epidermal growth factor (cbEGF)-like domain 3 of FBN1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In family 2, the mutation p.C908Y was identified in an interdomain region of the hybrid motif 2 linked to the cbEGF-like domain 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It can be concluded that FBN1 mutations involving cysteine substitutions are usually associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and EL with some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, pathology seemed more serious when the mutations disrupted the three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bridges in the cbEGF-like domains, which was more likely to cause typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> than if the mutations occurred in the hybrid motifs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data preliminarily establish a genotype-phenotype correlation in the diagnostic process of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and predominant EL with Marfan-like features </plain></SENT>
