<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Between December 1972 and December 1986, 83 patients with aneurysmal disease (n = 37) or dissection (n = 46) involving the ascending aorta underwent a variety of operations, including composite value-graft repairs (n = 39), separated replacements of the aortic valve and ascending aorta (n = 18), resuspension and graft replacement of the ascending aorta (n = 9), graft replacement of the ascending aorta only (n = 8), homograft root replacement (n = 3), aortic valve replacement with aortorrhaphy (n = 3), aotorrhaphy alone (n = 2), and use of a sutureless intraluminal prosthesis (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The inclusion method was used in nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hospital mortality rate was 10% for patients with annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath>, 21% (70% confidence interval 13% to 30%) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection, and 18% (70% confidence interval 14% to 22%) for the entire group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis showed age and cumulative bypass time to be significant for hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The estimated 5-year survival rates are 69.5% +/- 7.2% and 67.0% +/- 9.0% and 10-year estimates are 34.6% +/- 10.6% and 61.4% +/- 9.8% for dissection and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient survival was related to differing pathology and type of operation, and log-rank testing showed no differences at the 5% level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Attrition (17 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>) was mostly due to left ventricular dysfunction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, or aneurysmal disease in ungrafted aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Actuarial freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in patients with prosthetic valves is 92.0% +/- 4.0% and 83.5% +/- 6.8% at 5 and 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> late graft and cardiac complications is 72.5% +/- 9.1% and 48.8% +/- 13.1% at 5 and 10 years for aneurysmal disease and 79.1% +/- 7.3% and 67.3% +/- 9.9% at 5 and 10 years for dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reoperation in nine patients was required for pseudoaneurysms (n = 3), other <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> (n = 3), persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> (n = 1), and obsolescent valve prosthesis (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus hospital mortality does not seem to be significantly related to the type of operation used for pathologic conditions of the ascending aorta unless cumulative bypass time exceeds about 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Many nonfatal late complications are associated with a prosthetic valve, but late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is due primarily to cardiac causes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> in other parts of the aorta </plain></SENT>
