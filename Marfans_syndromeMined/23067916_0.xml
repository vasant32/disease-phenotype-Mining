<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The prevalence of adult patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (CHD) has been reported with a high degree of variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prevalence estimates have been calculated using birth rate, birth prevalence, and assumed survival and derived from large administrative databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To report more robust prevalence estimate, we performed a systematic review for studies concerning CHD prevalence in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, to diminish bias of calculated estimates, we conducted an evidence-based calculation for the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A systematic database search was performed to identify reports on the prevalence of adult CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>Bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and spontaneously closed defects were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, CHD prevalence was calculated using birth rate, birth prevalence, and survival estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our search yielded 10 publications on the prevalence of CHD in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four reported results from population wide cross-sectional data, whereas in 6, prevalence was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean prevalence reported by empirical studies was 3,562 per million when unspecified lesions were included and 2,297 per million when these were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean prevalence derived from calculation was 3,536 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our calculated estimate was 3,228 per million adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Taking these estimates as well as the limitations inherent to their derivation into consideration, the prevalence of CHD in the adult population is approximately 3,000 per million adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This systematic review presents a comprehensive overview of publications on the prevalence of CHD in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The best available evidence suggests that overall prevalence of CHD in the adult population is in the region of 3,000 per million </plain></SENT>
