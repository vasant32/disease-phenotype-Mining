<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> and an increased aortic root elastic modulus have been documented in persons with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> and increased elastic modulus on leaflet stress, strain, and coaptation, we used a finite-element model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> model incorporated the geometry, tissue thickness, and anisotropic elastic moduli of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human roots and valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four Marfan models were evaluated, in which the diameter of the aortic root was dilated by 5%, 15%, 30%, and 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aortic root elastic modulus in the 4 Marfan models was doubled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Under diastolic pressure, regional stresses and strains were evaluated, and the percentage of leaflet coaptation was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Root <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and stiffening significantly increased regional leaflet stress and strain compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stress increases ranged from 80% to 360% and strain increases ranged from 60% to 200% in the 50% dilated Marfan model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Leaflet stresses and strains were disproportionately high at the attachment edge and coaptation area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Leaflet coaptation was decreased by approximately 20% in the 50% root <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increasing root <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and root elastic modulus to simulate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> significantly increases leaflet stress and strain and reduces coaptation in an otherwise <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aortic valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These alterations may influence the decision to use valve-sparing aortic root replacement procedures in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
