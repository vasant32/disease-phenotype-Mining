<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on a novel de novo c.535C &gt; T in exon 6 leading to p.R179C <z:chebi fb="94" ids="33709">aminoacid</z:chebi> substitution in ACTA2 in a toddler girl with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001643'>persistent ductus arteriosus</z:hpo>, extensive cerebral white matter lesions, fixed <z:mp ids='MP_0002546'>dilated pupils</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002566'>intestinal malrotation</z:hpo>, and hypotonic bladder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, de novo ACTA2 R179H substitutions have been associated with a similar phenotype and additional cerebral developmental defects including underdeveloped corpus callosum and <z:mp ids='MP_0000866'>vermis hypoplasia</z:mp> in a single patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient here shows previously undescribed abnormal lobulation of the frontal lobes and position of the gyrus cinguli and rostral dysplasis of the corpus callosum; she died at the age of 3 years during surgery due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular fragility</z:e> and rupture of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001643'>ductus arteriosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Altogether these observations support a role of ACTA2 in brain development, especially related to the arginine at position 179 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> previously reported patients with R179H substitution successfully underwent the same surgery at younger ages, the severe outcome of our patient warns against the devastating effects of the R179C substitution on vasculature. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc </plain></SENT>
