<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The <z:mp ids='MP_0011575'>dilated aortic root</z:mp> is often completely asymptomatic and found incidentally on routine imaging studies such as chest radiograph, echocardiography, chest computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0011575'>dilated aortic root</z:mp> may be associated with underlying aortic valve abnormalities as seen with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It may also lead to the awareness of important underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> like the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is imperative that the <z:mp ids='MP_0011575'>dilated aortic root</z:mp> be observed carefully over time with serial imaging studies and that timely resection of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> be carried out before catastrophic complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003496" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic rupture</z:e>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: In recent years, the advent of molecular genetics has heightened awareness of familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> such as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> disease, and hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> and dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e>, these hereditary aortopathies are important to consider in the evaluation of patients with a dilated aorta and have implications for screening of the relatives of the patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: Because there is often uncertainty regarding the <z:mp ids='MP_0011575'>dilated aortic root</z:mp>, this review will summarize the approach to diagnosis, evaluation, and management of aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical features, diagnostic approaches, screening of relatives, and long term follow-up will be highlighted </plain></SENT>
