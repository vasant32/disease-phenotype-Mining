<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, there have been no descriptions of microfibrillar abnormalities characteristic of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e>, although biochemical analyses have highlighted apparent abnormalities in fibrillin synthesis, secretion and processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have conducted a biochemical and ultrastructural investigation of fibrillin expression and assembly by a panel of dermal fibroblast lines from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and related diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study has highlighted marked differences between cells in terms of secretion and aggregation of newly-synthesised fibrillin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, electron microscopic visualization of fibrillin assemblies has clearly demonstrated for the first time the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001050'>plethora</z:hpo> of microfibrillar abnormalities that underlie this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data emphasize the molecular complexity that is a feature of the diverse clinical phenotypes exhibited by Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
