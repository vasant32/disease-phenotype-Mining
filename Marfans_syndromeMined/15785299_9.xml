<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some of them reach adulthood without intervention and may present with symptoms, some require first intervention or re-operation for various reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although interventions become more and more frequent in these patients, limited knowledge exists on their quality of life (QoL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to analyze QoL in GUCH patients who underwent cardiac surgery after the age of 14 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A total of 296 patients with a mean age of 35+/-16 years (range 14-72 years) were operated on at our institution between July 1987 and December 2000, mainly for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>), outflow tract lesion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and co-arctation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early mortality was 3.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During follow-up QoL was assessed with the short form 36 health survey questionnaire (SF-36) and an additional questionnaire focused on medical and psychosocial aspects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results were analyzed for the total collective and in relation to the underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (CHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Quality of life was excellent and similar to an age- and gender-matched standard population, except in patients following repair of complete <z:mp ids='MP_0011667'>AV-canal</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The main restrictions in this group were found in the emotional aspect (62.5+/-29.9) and physical role function (60.5+/-25.0) and reflected in limitations of daily activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Outcome and QoL in adolescents and adults with CHD is excellent and similar to that of an age- and gender-matched standard population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the future special attention should be focused more strongly on medical follow-up and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740697" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychosocial problems</z:e> in this increasing group of patients </plain></SENT>
