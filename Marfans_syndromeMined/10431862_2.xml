<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reimplantation of the native, structurally intact aortic valve within a Dacron tube graft corrects annular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of sinotubular junction and aortic sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Durability of this valve repair with respect to increased mechanical stress on valve cusps is discussed controversially and is yet unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Since 7/93, replacement of the ascending aorta with repair of the aortic valve was performed in 48 patients (34 male, 14 female; 47+/-20 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients (31%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and five patients (10%) had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> type A (two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 11 patients (23%), concomitant replacement of the aortic arch was necessary utilizing elephant trunk technique in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, one patient required mitral valve repair and two other patients coronary artery bypass grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical and echocardiographic follow-up was performed in 6-12 month intervals for a cumulative study period of 100 patient years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients (4%) died 5 and 20 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One additional patient experienced a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> within the first postoperative week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three patients (6%) with an early postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> (AI) &gt; 1 required aortic valve replacement after 9, 11, and 14 months due to progressive AI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In these patients, distortion of the aortic root geometry led to valve incompetence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other patients have no or mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The repair now remains stable for up to 63 months (mean 25+/-18 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Other valve related complications did not occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that this type of aortic valve repair achieves excellent results in selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Perfect coaptation of valve cusps during the repair with no or only trace AI at initial echocardiography seems to be essential for durability </plain></SENT>
