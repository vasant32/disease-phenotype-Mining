<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few long-term results have been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present our results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: More than 450 David procedures have been performed in our institution so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, 126 patients were operated between July 1993 and December 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median age was 57 (8-83) years and 46 (36.5%) were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As many as 26 (20.6%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, 21 (16.7%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> type A (AADA) and 67 (53.2%) had additional procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were six (4.8%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in 30 post-operative period (POD), four of whom had AADA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the follow-up, there were 32 (25.4%) late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, 11 (34.4%) of these were caused by cardiac or underlying disease or op-related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As many as 15 (11.9%) patients were re-operated; six (40%) were Marfan patients and two (13.3%) had early <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follow-up echocardiography of 76 (60.3%) event-free patients showed valve insufficiency (AI)≤AI I° in 68 (89.5%) and grade II in 7 (9.2%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Leaflet degeneration due to proposed leaflet contact with the straight Dacron graft was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A total of 36 (47.4%) patients were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I, 33 (43.4%) in NYHA II, and five (6.6%) were in class III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During the entire follow-up of 790 patient-years, there was no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Survival at 1, 5 and 10 years was 93%, 85% and 70%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Freedom from valve replacement at 1, 5 and 10 years was 96%, 91% and 87%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the underlying pathology, valve-sparing David I procedure has acceptable long-term results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Valve-related complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> is exceedingly low </plain></SENT>
