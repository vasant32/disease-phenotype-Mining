<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective follow-up with clinical assessments and echocardiography was done of 167 consecutive patients who had reimplantation of the aortic valve as treatment of aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their mean age was 45 +/- 15 years, 78% were men, 38% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, 14% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, and 7% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aortic valve was reimplanted into a straight Dacron (Dupont, Wilmington, DE) tube in 89 patients and in a Dacron tube with creation of neoaortic sinuses in 78 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aortic cusp repair was performed in 66 patients, and the free margin was reinforced with a fine Gore-Tex suture (W.L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gore &amp; Assoc, Flagstaff, AZ) in 36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 5.1 +/- 3.8 years and was 100% complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were two operative and six late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Survival at 10 years was 92% +/- 3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> developed in 3 patients, and severe developed in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Freedom from moderate or severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> was 94% +/- 4% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients required aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Freedom from aortic valve replacement was 95% +/- 4% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At the latest follow-up, 90% of the patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I and 10% were in class II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reimplantation of the aortic valve to treat patients with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is associated with excellent long-term survival and low rates of valve-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Reimplantation of the aortic valve is a durable type of aortic valve repair </plain></SENT>
