<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The clinical features and outcomes of elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (ABAD) are less well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we sought to evaluate the clinical features and outcomes and derive a simple risk stratification rule for elderly with ABAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We categorized 383 patients with ABAD enrolled in the International Registry of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic Dissection</z:hpo> into two strata (aged less than 70 years and aged 70 years or more) and compared their clinical features and in-hospital outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further, we developed a clinical decision rule to risk-stratify elderly with ABAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-two percent (161 of 383) of patients with ABAD were aged 70 years or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, history of prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> were more common in the elderly patients, whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009171" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cocaine abuse</z:e> were less common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The in-hospital complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>/shock was more common among elderly, and malperfusion of a visceral organ less frequent among elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In-hospital mortality was higher in the elderly cohort compared with the younger patients (16% versus 10%, p = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A classification tree identified that elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>/shock had the highest risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (56%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In absence of this, any branch vessel involvement was associated with the next highest mortality rate (28.6%) followed by presence of periaortic <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> (10.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, elderly patients without any of these three risk factors had an extremely low mortality rate (1.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights important differences between older and younger patients with ABAD in their clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We also propose a simple decision rule that allows stepwise risk-stratification in elderly patients with ABAD </plain></SENT>
