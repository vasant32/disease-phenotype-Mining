<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Aortic valve resuspension for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> repair is associated with removal of the sinus of Valsalva </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This may cause changes in leaflet motion and thus impact on long-term durability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The opening and closing characteristics of the aortic valve leaflets after reimplantation were studied using a published technique and a modification to create a 'neosinus', and the results compared to those of an age-matched control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between September 1995 and March 2002, 25 patients underwent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aortic root reconstruction (group A), while in a further 21 patients the modified neosinus technique was used (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both groups, the native valve was preserved and suspended inside a tubular prosthesis, with reimplantation of the coronary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transthoracic and transesophageal studies of aortic valve dynamics were performed intraoperatively, before hospital discharge, and at one year after surgery in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients; the data were compared with those from a separate group of 25 matched control individuals (group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The valve opening velocity was 61.3+/-20.1, 46.3+/-8 and 29.2+/-9.8 cm/s in groups A, B and C, respectively (group A versus B, p = 0.003; A versus C, p &lt;0.0001; B versus C, p &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Closing velocity was increased to 57.5+/-23 and 43.8+/-7 cm/s in groups A and B, compared to 23.6+/-7 cm/s in group C (A versus B, p = 0.012; A versus C, p &lt;0.0001; B versus C, p = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In seven group A patients, the leaflets touched the prosthetic wall during systole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Slow systolic closing displacement (SCD) amounted to 7.3+/-6 % of maximal opening in group A and 12.6+/-5 % in group B (p = 0.05), compared to 21.1+/-8.3% in group C (group A versus group C, p &lt;0.0001; B versus C, p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Reimplantation of the natural aortic valve in a prosthetic graft causes abnormally high opening and closing speeds, with possibly increased stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The study results showed lower valve opening and closure dynamics after the creation of a sinus bulge compared to the conventional reimplantation technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, mid-term clinical observations showed favorable valve competence for both types of repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further long-term follow up is necessary to prove whether more physiological leaflet dynamics lead to improved durability </plain></SENT>
