<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He had been sick with an upper <z:hpo ids='HP_0011947'>respiratory tract infection</z:hpo> for a few days with frequent coughing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chest radiography showed subcutaneous and mediastinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002097'>emphysema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neck CT at the level of C7 showed air around the trachea, extending to the subcutaneous tissue and the epidural space through the intervertebral foramen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>His height was 180 cm and his weight 55 kg, and he had a 181 cm arm span </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo>, and ultrasonic cardiography demonstrated mitral and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005180'>tricuspid regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings agreed partially with the clinical criteria of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A rapid rise of airway pressure induced by a coughing attack and loud shouting during the fight probably caused the laceration of the connective tissue in the airway, resulting in mediastinal and epidural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002097'>emphysema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this case report, CT at the C7 level satisfactorily identified air in the mediastinum extending to the epidural space through intervertebral foramen </plain></SENT>
