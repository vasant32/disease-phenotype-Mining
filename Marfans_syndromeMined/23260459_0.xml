<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This includes assessment for the presence of an underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorder</z:e>, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> disease, or a familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Screening family members is necessary, inasmuch as up to 20% of first-degree relatives of the patient with a thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> will also have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical therapy is often prescribed, and beta-blocker therapy to reduce the stress on the aortic wall is usually recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, very few clinical trials of pharmacologic therapy in humans with thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> disease have been conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mouse models have led to important discoveries and insight into the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> syndromes, and there is hope these may lead to effective therapy in people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several studies are ongoing that examine the role of angiotensin receptor blockers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lifestyle modification is also important for patients with thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo>, including restrictions on physical activity, weight lifting, and recommendations about the management of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Long-term surveillance of the aorta, even after successful surgery, is necessary for timing of prophylactic surgery and to evaluate for late complications </plain></SENT>
