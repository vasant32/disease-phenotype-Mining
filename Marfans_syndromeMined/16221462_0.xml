<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Foot problems are common in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> because of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001380'>ligamentous laxity</z:hpo> that affects the weightbearing joints most </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such patients frequently are seen by their general practitioners or podiatrists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Educating primary health care providers about a metatarsal index, if it is sufficiently sensitive and specific, may help patients get early and appropriate workup for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A metatarsal equivalent to the metacarpal index (MCI) in the hand was evaluated as a diagnostic tool for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (and possibly other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixteen had a genetic diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 20 controls each for the MCI and the metatarsal index (MTI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hand and foot radiographs were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average MCI in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> was 9.8 compared to 7.6 in the control group (p &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average MTI was 12.7 and 9.8, respectively (p &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An MCI value of 8.5 and an MTI value of 10.5 had the best statistical profiles (combination of sensitivity and specificity) in diagnosing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in our study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The MTI as a screening tool for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is as effective as, if not more than, the well-recognized MCI </plain></SENT>
