<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One hundred and seventy-nine patients with 237 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernias</z:hpo> of the groin who were at high risk for recurrence after classic hernioplasty were operated upon; the procedure of giant prosthetic reinforcement of the visceral sac (GPRVS) was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients in this series had predominantly recurrent and re-recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, a few were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> with bilateral primary direct <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernias</z:hpo> and some had associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e>, such as Marfan and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GPRVS eliminates <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernias</z:hpo> of the groin by rendering the peritoneum inextensible by placing, in the preperitoneal space, a large prosthesis that extends far beyond the borders of the myopectineal orifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The myopectineal orifice is the weak spot at which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernias</z:hpo> of the groin begin and is bounded by the rectus, oblique abdominal and iliopsoas muscles and the <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17309">pectin</z:chebi> of the pubis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In bilateral GPRVS, the peritoneum of both groins is reinforced with a single prosthesis inserted in the preperitoneal space through the midline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In unilateral GPRVS, the mesh envelops the peritoneum of a single groin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This simplifies the operation and makes it suitable for surgical centers that perform outpatient operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prosthesis with the best physical characteristics for GPRVS is Mersilene (polyester fiber) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Unsutured prostheses of <z:chebi fb="80" ids="53550">polypropylene</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53251">Teflon</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi>) may not adhere at the far edges, leading to a failure and recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The over-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recurrence rate in this series of problem <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernias</z:hpo> was 3.7 per cent, which is extremely good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the rate becomes outstanding if recurrences resulting from meshes unsuitable for GPRVS are excluded </plain></SENT>
