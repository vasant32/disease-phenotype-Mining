<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its long-term success in preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report a study in sheep to establish whether the externally supporting mesh, as used clinically, is biologically incorporated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The strength of the resulting mesh/artery composite has been tested.METHODSThe carotid artery of growing sheep (n = 6) was enclosed in a mesh sleeve made of a polymer, <z:chebi fb="12" ids="53259">polyethylene terephthalate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a predefined interval of 4-6 months, a length of the artery was excised, including the sleeved and unsleeved portions, and was stress tested and examined histologically.RESULTSOne animal died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> 7 days after implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparing sleeved with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> segments, the overall thickness was increased and there was a fibrotic sheet in the periarterial space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall vessel wall architecture was preserved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although media thickness of ensleeved arteries was smaller and in one animal mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> was found in one quadrant of the outer part of the media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase in stiffness and maximum tensile strength of the supported segments compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> arterial tissue.CONCLUSIONSPolyethylene terephthalate mesh, as used for the external support of the <z:mp ids='MP_0011575'>dilated aortic root</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, becomes incorporated in the periadventitial tissue of the carotid artery of sheep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Limited thinning of the media, without any signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> or medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, was visible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly greater tensile strength in the carotid artery/mesh composite compared with the unsleeved carotid artery </plain></SENT>
