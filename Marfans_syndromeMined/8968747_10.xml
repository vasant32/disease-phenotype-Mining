<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Potential hammerhead ribozymes that possess a catalytic domain and flanking sequence complementary to a target <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> can cleave in trans at a putative cleavage site within the target molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the potential of hammerhead ribozymes to down-regulate the product of the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin is a 347 kDa <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> that is a major constituent of the elastin-associated microfibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the FBN1 gene are responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>), a common systemic disorder of the connective tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many FBN1 mutations responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> appear to act in a dominant-negative fashion, raising the possibility that reduction of the amount of product from the mutant FBN1 allele might be a valid therapeutic approach for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A trans-acting hammerhead ribozyme (FBN1-RZ1) targeted to the 5' end of the human FBN1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> has been designed and synthesized, and shown to cleave its target efficiently in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FBN1-RZ1 cleavage is <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> dependent and efficient at both 37 and 50 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Delivery of the FBN1-RZ1 ribozyme into cultured dermal fibroblasts, by receptor-mediated endocytosis of a ribozyme-transferrin-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53411">polylysine</z:chebi> complex, specifically reduces both cellular FBN1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and the deposition of fibrillin in the extracellular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the use of hammerhead ribozymes is a valid approach to the study of fibrillin gene expression and possibly to the development of a therapeutic approach to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
