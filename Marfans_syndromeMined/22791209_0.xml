<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Magnetic resonance or computed tomography imaging of the pulmonary artery and aorta was performed in 87 patients with proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diameters of the root and trunk of the pulmonary artery and of the aortic root were measured perpendicular to the long axes of the vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary artery diameters were measured on axial images, and aortic diameters were assessed on oblique sagittal images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values in the literature, 47 of the 87 patients (54%) had widening of the trunk of the pulmonary artery (â‰¥30 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these 47, 15% had no sign of disease of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean (SD) ratio between the diameters of the root and trunk of the pulmonary artery was 1.18 (0.155) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that surgery of the ascending aorta and high body surface area were associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the trunk of the pulmonary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004927'>Pulmonary artery dilatation</z:hpo> is present in a high proportion of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> as assessed using cutoff values based on measurements in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Severe disease of the ascending aorta correlates significantly with pulmonary artery trunk <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
