<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An excessive rate of re-operation for recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> after this conservative approach might compensate the prosthesis-related risk of the Bentall operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 1995 to September 2000, 69 consecutive patients with aortic expansive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and concomitant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic valve disease</z:e>, were submitted to the Bentall operation (group A, n=37) in the presence of an abnormal valve, or to root remodelling (group B, n=32) in cases of secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003504" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ai">aortic incompetence</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient in group A and four in group B had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The follow-up was 1021 patient-months (range, 1-68 months) in group A and 926 in group B (1-64 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The event-free survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the difference between curves was evaluated using the Mantel-Cox log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The operative mortality was 5% in group A and 0% in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient died at follow-up in group A and none in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients (three Marfan) in group B were re-operated on because of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 5-year event-free survival was 88+/-7% in group A and 82+/-8% in group B (P=0.58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Early residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> remained stable over time only in patients with good early results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mid-term follow-up failed to reveal statistically significant differences in the clinical outcome between remodelling and the Bentall operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results support the widespread use of root remodelling, provided that an indication to this conservative approach is achieved after careful, case-by-case evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A good early operative result is likely to remain stable over time </plain></SENT>
