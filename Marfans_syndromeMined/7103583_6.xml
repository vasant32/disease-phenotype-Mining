<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> dissection was present in 29, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection in 11; 56 had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> only, and 4 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four different operative procedures were applied independent of the type of disease: repair and reduction aortoplasty (21), reduction aortoplasty reinforced by nylon net (17), supracoronary graft replacement (42), and composite graft replacement with reimplantation of both coronary ostia (20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early mortality was 10%, and late mortality was 12% after a mean follow-up of 45 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Retrospective comparative analysis of the four operative methods led to the following conclusion: reduction aortoplasty supported by a tightly wrapped synthetic net is a suitable method in patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus of Valsalva and without dissection or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Particular attention needs to be drawn to the proximal anchor stitches to avoid late net displacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with supracoronary or composite graft replacement, this method carried a lower complication rate, particularly in regard to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection with intact aortic root, supracoronary graft replacement is preferred, whereas in those with annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> with dilated sinus of Valsalva and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, composite graft replacement has become the procedure of choice </plain></SENT>
