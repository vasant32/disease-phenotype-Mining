<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the characteristics of infantile <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and the response to treatment of patients with this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: No previous study has reported the features of this condition nor the effect of treatment on patients with this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients seen at one institution who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> by age three were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of the 600 patients from the group examined who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> fit the above criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Skeletal and general features were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen of the 14 patients had no family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, a finding which does not fit the usual <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant inheritance</z:hpo> pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 14 patients had exaggeration of the Marfan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one patient had cardiac valvular insufficiency that required repair by age 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients had thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo>, 10 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>lens dislocation</z:hpo>, and eight had sternal deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002827'>hip dislocations</z:hpo>, two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002021'>pyloric stenosis</z:hpo>, and two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001270'>Motor delay</z:hpo> was evidenced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of walking past 18 months in nine patients; three of these patients were never able to walk independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient each died at ages 1, 3, 4, and 8 years; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> others have survived to present (mean age, 13 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mean curve of the patients' spines at presentation was 38 degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Eleven curves were double major, two were thoracolumbar, and one was double thoracic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Brace wear did not halt curve progression in any of the nine patients for whom it was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Instrumentation without fusion was used in three patients for a mean of 3 years, with best results in one nonkyphotic curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Nine patients underwent instrumented fusion at a mean age of 6.6 years (range, 3-13 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Mean curve correction was 51% (from 72 degrees to 34 degrees) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Final mean curve was 54 degrees for a mean correction of 20% at the 5-year (average, 5.4 years) follow-up examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> complications occurred in three patients, and five patients needed a second surgery for late complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Causes for curve increase after surgery included growth and loss of fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this most severe form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, bracing has a limited role and is only to be used if the curve is less than 40 degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Surgery should not be performed on a patient younger than four years of age because many patients with large curves before this age will succumb spontaneously to cardiac complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Instrumentation without fusion should be considered only for patients with no significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Results of fusion are better for patients who are older than five years of age </plain></SENT>
