<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who developed coronary ostial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> at the sites of the coronary anastomosis, presumably because of oversized windows made in the graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were successfully treated by redo composite graft replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To prevent this complication, it is important to consider that the hole made in the tube graft should not be larger than the diameter of the respective coronary ostium to avoid exposure of the diseased aortic wall to the circulating blood as much as possible, and that the suture used to anastomose the coronary buttons should pass through the rim of the ostium rather than through the aortic wall surrounding it </plain></SENT>
