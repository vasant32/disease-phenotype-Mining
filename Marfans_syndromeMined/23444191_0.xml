<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we analyzed data from the GenTAC registry, the NIH-sponsored program that collects information about individuals with genetically triggered thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and cardiovascular conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed cross-sectional analyses in adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>), familial thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> or dissection (FTAAD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp>) with thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> or dissection, and subjects under 50 years of age with thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> or dissection (TAAD &lt;50 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Women comprised 32% of 1,449 subjects and were 21% of subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp>, 34% with FTAAD, 22% with TAAD &lt;50 years, and 47% with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> occurred with equal gender frequency yet women with <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp> had more extensive dissections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aortic size was smaller in women but was similar after controlling for BSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age at operation for aortic valve dysfunction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> or dissection did not differ by gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis (adjusting for age, BSA, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, study site, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and subgroup diagnoses) showed that women had fewer total aortic surgeries (OR = 0.65, P &lt; 0.01) and were less likely to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors</z:chebi> (ACEi; OR = 0.68, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As in <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp>, other genetically triggered <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic diseases</z:e> such as FTAAD and TAAD &lt;50 are more common in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In women, decreased prevalence of aortic operations and less treatment with ACEi may be due to their smaller absolute aortic diameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal studies are needed to determine if women are at higher risk for adverse events </plain></SENT>
