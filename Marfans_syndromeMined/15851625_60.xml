<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We review data concerning the heritability of arterial stiffness, and propose an integrated view of the structural and genetic determinants of arterial stiffness, based on a candidate gene approach and recent studies on gene expression profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arterial stiffness seems to have a genetic component, which is largely independent of the influence of blood pressure and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In animal models of essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (SHR and SHR-SP), structural modifications of the arterial wall include an increase in the number of elastin/smooth muscle cell (SMC) connections, and smaller fenestrations of the internal elastic lamina, possibly leading to redistribution of the mechanical load toward elastic materials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These modifications may give rise to mechanisms that explain why changes in arterial wall material accompanying wall <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> in these animals are not associated with an increase in arterial stiffness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In monogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e> (Marfan, Williams, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndromes</z:e>) and the corresponding animal models, precise characterization of the arterial phenotype makes it possible to determine the influence of abnormal genetically determined wall components on arterial stiffness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such studies have highlighted the role of extracellular matrix signaling in the vascular wall and have shown that elastin and collagen not only display elasticity or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> but also are involved in the control of SMC function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data provide strong evidence that arterial stiffness is affected by the amount and density of stiff wall material and the spatial organization of that material </plain></SENT>
