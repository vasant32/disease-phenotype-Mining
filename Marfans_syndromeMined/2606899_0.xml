<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The apparent molecular weight of the protein was about 185 kDa after reduction with 2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="41218">mercaptoethanol</z:chebi> and 175 kDa after limited pepsin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 185 kDa protein was susceptible to the <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> collagenase but resistant to the animal collagenase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation revealed the specific interaction of the pepsin-treated 175 kDa collagenous protein with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to human type IV collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From the patterns of CNBr <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> mapping the 185 kDa band was identified as alpha 1 (IV) chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Type IV collagen in the skin is generally considered to be of non-fibroblastic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in "diseased" condition, dermal fibroblasts might produce type IV collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical manifestation in relation to production of type IV collagen by cultured skin fibroblasts from Marfan patients is discussed </plain></SENT>
