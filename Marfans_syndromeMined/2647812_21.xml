<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The family has been followed up since 1977 after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of a second teenager from a kindred of 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> or a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three members died of ruptured aortic dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011851'>hemopericardium</z:hpo> at 14, 18 and 24 years of age, respectively; a fourth member died suddenly at age 48 years, a few years after aortic repair for aneurysmal dilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One member underwent surgical repair of an ascending aortic dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> at age 18 years and is still alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four members are currently under close medical observation for aortic or arterial dilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histologic examination of the aortic wall at autopsy or surgery in three patients revealed a loss of elastic fibers, deposition of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37395">mucopolysaccharide</z:chebi>-like material in the media and cystic medial changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Types I and III collagen from cultured fibroblasts appeared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> on gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results of indirect immunofluorescent studies of the elastin-associated microfibrillar fiber array in skin and fibroblast culture from multiple family members were also <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This dramatic familial cluster of aortic dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and aortic or arterial dilation suggests a genetically determined disease of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant inheritance</z:hpo> although the basic defect remains unknown </plain></SENT>
