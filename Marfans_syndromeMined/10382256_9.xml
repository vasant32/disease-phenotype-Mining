<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: A review of current knowledge, clinical publications, and recent concepts of the causes of Stickler's syndrome was correlated with a clinical review of the condition at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To acquaint orthopedic spine surgeons with the natural history, associated anomalies, and high incidence of spinal deformity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> in children with Stickler's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Stickler's syndrome is a hereditary, progressive arthro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015397" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ophthalmopathy</z:e> with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant inheritance</z:hpo> pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The estimated incidence is 1 in 10,000 people, which is slightly more common than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The experience with Stickler's syndrome was reviewed in seven children, 2-15 years of age, with particular attention to the spinal abnormalities secondary to the connective tissue <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six of the children had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, and four had wedging or flattening of the vertebrae or <z:mp ids='MP_0011175'>platyspondylia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In general, the spinal changes became more prominent in the older children with Stickler's syndrome, with the spinal vertebrae affected by the generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002656'>epiphyseal dysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> is no different in children with Stickler's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most difficult aspect is in diagnosing the condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The importance of recognizing the syndrome is to allow for the investigation and treatment of the many other associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> associated with Stickler's syndrome, such as the high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000347'>mandibular hypoplasia</z:hpo> that may result in problems with anesthesia should the spine require surgical stabilization </plain></SENT>
