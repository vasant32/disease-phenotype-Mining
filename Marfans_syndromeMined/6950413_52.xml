<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One alpha 2 chain appears <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>; the abnormal chain has a higher apparent molecular weight than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and migrates more slowly during electrophoresis in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A similar change in electrophoretic behavior is seen in the prepro alpha 2 chain and the pN alpha 2 chain (which contains the amino-terminal extension) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Asymmetric cleavage of the pepsin-treated procollagens with a fibroblast collagenase locates the abnormal segment amino terminal to the cleavage site, and analysis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29306,29308">cyanogen</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="25" ids="15858">bromide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> of collagenase cleavage <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> and of whole collagens indicates that the abnormal segment is in either the alpha 2CB3 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> or the short segment of alpha 2CB5 amino terminal to the collagenase site of the altered alpha 2 chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The higher apparent molecular weight is consistent with the insertion of a small <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> fragment of approximately 20 amino acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This alteration in chain size has marked effects on crosslinking because collagen from the patient's skin was 5-10 times more extractable in nondenaturing solvents than that from control skins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the abnormal chain was not found in several other individuals with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, these findings suggest that the phenotype may be the expression of a variety of primary structure alterations in the chains of type I collagen that interfere with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> crosslink formation </plain></SENT>
