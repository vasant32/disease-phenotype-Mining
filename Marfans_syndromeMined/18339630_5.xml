<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we found that fibrillin-1 deficiency in mice impairs alveolar formation and recapitulates the pulmonary features of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To further elucidate effectors involved in distal lung formation, we performed expression profiling analysis comparing the fibrillin-1-deficient and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> developing lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NeuroD, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, fulfilled the expression criteria for a candidate mediator of distal lung development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated its role in murine lung development using genetically targeted NeuroD-deficient mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that NeuroD deficiency results in both impaired alveolar septation and altered <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the pulmonary neuroendocrine cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NeuroD-deficient mice had <z:mp ids='MP_0001183'>enlarged alveoli</z:mp> associated with reduced epithelial proliferation in the airway and airspace compartments during development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the neuroendocrine compartment in these mice manifested an increased number of neuroepithelial bodies but a reduced number of solitary pulmonary neuroendocrine cells in the neonatal lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of NeuroD in a murine lung epithelial cell line conferred a neuroendocrine phenotype characterized by the induction of neuroendocrine markers as well as increased proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results support an unanticipated role for NeuroD in the regulation of pulmonary neuroendocrine and alveolar morphogenesis and suggest an intimate connection between the neuroendocrine compartment and distal lung development </plain></SENT>
