<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Pulse wave velocity (PWV) constitutes a valid index of arterial stiffness osteoprotegerin (OPG) and osteopontin (OPN) which are well-established <z:hpo ids='HP_0004934'>vascular calcification</z:hpo> inhibitors, highly correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and cardiovascular events incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association of PWV with the aforementioned novel biomarkers in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> (AAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 108 men with AAA (AAA group) candidates for endovascular repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We excluded patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> or other collagen-related disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-one age-matched men, with stable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD), but without AAA, served as controls (CO group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PWV, clinical parameters and serum levels of osteoprotegerin (OPG), osteopontin (OPN), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10 were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With the exception of higher smoking rate and the lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi>'s usage in the AAA group, there were non-significant differences in the rest of demographic and clinical parameters (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found significantly higher levels of PWV in AAA than CO group (12.99±3.75 m/s vs 10.03±1.57 m/s, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In parallel, serum OPG, OPN, IL-6 levels were considerably increased, while IL-10 levels were downregulated (p&lt;0.001) in AAA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PWV positively correlated with mean blood pressure, OPG concentrations and AAA diameter in univariate and multivariate analysis (R(2)=0.498, p=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, age and OPG remained independent determinants of AAA presence in the whole study cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Arterial stiffness, circulating <z:hpo ids='HP_0004934'>vascular calcification</z:hpo> inhibitors and <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> seem to be significantly upregulated in patients with AAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An independent association of PWV with mean blood pressure, OPG and AAA diameter is of clinical importance which requires further investigation </plain></SENT>
