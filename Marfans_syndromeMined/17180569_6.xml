<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The data were collected prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antibiotic prophylaxis was used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Differences were tested statistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 35 adults (28 men; male/female ratio 4:1) with a median age of 23 years (range 18 years to 47 years 1 month) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A previous Welch operation had been performed in one (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median operating time was 65 minutes (range 45-105 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two bars were inserted in one patient, and stabilizers were used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>Pneumothorax</z:hpo> occurred in 9 (26%), wound <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> in 3 (9%), and bar slips in 5 (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median hospital stay was 7 days (range 4-10 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bars were removed in 14 (40%) patients without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Follow-up occurred 6 and 12 months after bar removed, at which times no recurrence of the pectus and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000884'>sternal protrusions</z:hpo> were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the other part of the study, 141 children and adolescents (105 boys; male/female ratio 3:1) with a median age of 13 years (range 4 years 11 months to 17 years 8 months) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A previous Welch operation had been performed in five (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Two bars were inserted in four, and stabilizers were used in 100 (71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The median operating time was 65 minutes (40-185 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>Pneumothorax</z:hpo> occurred in 33 (24%), wound <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> in 1 (0.7%), and bar slips in 18 (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The median hospital stay was 7 days (range 5-18 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Bars were removed in 77 (55%) without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Follow-up occurred 6 and 12 months after bar removed, and the last follow-up was eventually planned at the end of growth (age 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The pectus recurred in one patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000884'>sternal protrusion</z:hpo> occurred in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Differences between groups were as follows: a significantly higher proportion of adult patients were treated with stabilizers (P &lt; 0.001), and there were significantly more wound abscesses in adults (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Nuss procedure is as effective for correcting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> in adults as it is in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>However, in adults the bars tended to be less stable, and wound abscesses occurred more frequently </plain></SENT>
