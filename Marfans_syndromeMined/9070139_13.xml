<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During the development of a regional genetic register for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's Syndrome</z:e> the outcome of 91 pregnancies in 36 women with this condition was established retrospectively and the cardiovascular and obstetric complications documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No patient had a significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001626'>cardiovascular abnormality</z:hpo> limiting function before her pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 36 women, four had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> relating to pregnancy and two others required aortic surgery following delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty women had uncomplicated gestational histories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of obstetric complications did not exceed expectation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> are at significant risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in pregnancy even in the absence of preconceptional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001626'>cardiovascular abnormality</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>Aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> may be a predictor of risk but dissection may occur without significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Guidelines for obstetric care are suggested and preconceptional assessment recommended </plain></SENT>
