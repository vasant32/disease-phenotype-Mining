<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> is based on the identification of a combination of clinical manifestations in the ocular, musculoskeletal, and cardiovascular organ systems defined in the Ghent Nosology (De Paepe et al, 1996) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Confirmation of the diagnosis in an individual requires the presence of major clinical manifestations in at least two organ systems associated with involvement of a third organ system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In relatives of an affected proband, major involvement of one organ system and involvement of a second organ system confirms the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Major clinical criteria are very specific for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and include a combination of (4 out of 8) skeletal manifestations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> or dissection of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of- and the guidelines for the assessment of each of these major criteria are well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Minor clinical criteria are less typical, but their importance in the diagnostic process should not be underestimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, figures on the prevalence as well as practical guidelines for the assessment of most minor criteria are lacking, especially for those involving the cardiovascular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The major cardiovascular manifestation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> is a progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0005111'>dilatation of the ascending aorta</z:hpo>, leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> formation and eventually to fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003496" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic rupture</z:e> or dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic dissection</z:hpo> in early adult life is the leading cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis of individuals at risk of the disease is extremely important as timely treatment of cardiovascular complications has greatly improved life expectancy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite progress in medical and surgical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> continues to be associated with significant morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This may be related to inadequate diagnosis or treatment, but also to the occurrence of cardiovascular problems in ageing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients that were unrecognised until now, such as left ventricular (LV) dysfunction.This thesis is focused on the study of cardiovascular manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> which localize beyond the aortic root and on the presently unknown relationship between the severity of the cardiovascular phenotype and the genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the first part, we have studied the prevalence and diagnostic value of the following cardiovascular manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> (MVP) and calcification of the mitral valve annulus, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the main pulmonary artery (MPA) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> or dissection of the descending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We found a significantly higher prevalence of MVP in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, indicating that this feature is useful in the diagnostic evaluation of the condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In contrast, calcification of the mitral valve annulus appears to be very uncommon, difficult to quantify and therefore not useful in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We also studied the dimension of the MPA in a series of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients and defined a cut-of value that can be used in the diagnostic evaluation of adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In addition, we showed that diameters of the aorta measured at different levels beyond the aortic root are increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, there was too much overlap with the values obtained in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control population to provide cut-off values for the descending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, we developed practical guidelines for the cardiovascular evaluation of patients referred for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In the second part, we studied LV function in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> using a combination of echocardiography (both conventional echocardiography and tissue Doppler imaging) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>We could demonstrate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients present a combination of systolic and diastolic dysfunction that is not related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>This may be attributed to a primary contractile dysfunction of the myocardium and is likely related to the underlying alterations in the elastic features of the myocardium, resulting from the microfibrillar defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>This observation is important in the development of new therapeutic strategies for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Affected individuals may benefit from a treatment with agents that support myocardial function such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin converting enzyme--inhibitors</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> type-1 receptor blockers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, since <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients survive longer thanks to improved medical and surgical treatments, LV dysfunction may become an important issue in the follow-up of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In the third part, we have studied aspects of local and global wave reflection in the aorta of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Early return of reflected waves boosts systolic pressure and presents an extra load for the heart and the central vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>As such, these wave reflections are regarded as one of the important determinants of central blood pressure and can contribute to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>However, we were unable to demonstrate clear differences in both local and global parameters of wave reflection between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>This could be explained by the fact that <z:mp ids='MP_0001257'>increased length</z:mp> of the aorta on the one hand and increased aortic stiffness on the other hand counterbalance each other in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients without yielding any net effect on wave reflection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In the last part of this thesis, we investigated the correlation between the severity of the cardiovascular phenotype in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and the type of FBN1 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>First, we investigated the correlation between parameters of aortic stiffness (distensibility and pulse wave velocity measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and the type of FBN1 mutation (missense or in-frame deletions/insertions versus nonsense or out-of-frame deletions/insertions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>We could not demonstrate any significant differences between these different mutation types, indicating that the FBN1 genotype is not the sole determinant of aortic stiffness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Second, we provided a detailed description of clinical findings in three unrelated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> families in which an FBN1 mutation was identified and which demonstrate striking intrafamilial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>phenotypic variability</z:hpo> as another illustration of the absence of genotype/phenotype correlations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>This study also illustrated several important issues in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>First, repeated clinical examination of suspected patients can be necessary in order to establish a correct and final diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Second, extensive family history taking and clinical examination of first degree relatives can be highly contributory to the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Third, patients with an 'atypical' <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> phenotype may show substantial clinical overlap with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265313" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Weill-Marchesani syndrome</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e> and represent a diagnostic challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that additional mutational analysis of the FBN1 gene can be a valuable aid to the diagnosis and help to outline medical management options in these challenging cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have refined diagnostic guidelines for the assessment of minor cardiovascular manifestations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, shown that LV dysfunction is part of the cardiovascular spectrum and should be followed in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients, and demonstrated that aortic wave reflection is not elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>In this work, we also investigated genotype/phenotype correlations, illustrated the marked (intrafamilial) variability in phenotypic expression of the condition, and the value of molecular testing in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Overall, this thesis nicely illustrates that close interaction and collaboration between cardiology and genetics is an added value to the study of disease pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> in general </plain></SENT>
