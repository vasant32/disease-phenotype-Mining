<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The propositus had the prototypic features of Loeys-Dietz syndrome with a de novo mutation in TGFBR2 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Continuous positive airway pressure was introduced at age 7 years and provided significant improvement in his nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo>-related symptoms, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000805'>enuresis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the severe craniofacial abnormalities in Loeys-Dietz syndrome may predispose patients to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo>, even at a very young age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> in the propositus, the administration of continuous positive airway pressure was highly effective in alleviating his symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> was successfully treated using continuous positive airway pressure in a patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome </plain></SENT>
