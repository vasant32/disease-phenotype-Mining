<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 1996 to June 2006, 41 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004954'>descending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> underwent operation, including DeBakey type III dissection in 26, false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in 6, true <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in 4, and residual or newly complicated type III dissection after the surgery of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Operations were performed by left heart bypass in 9, femoral-femoral bypass in 7, pulmonary-femoral bypass in 2, and deep hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> in 23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The whole thoracic descending aorta was replaced in 15, and intercostal arteries were reimplanted in 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One patient died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> with the hospital mortality 2.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Main complications: respiratory dysfunction in 6, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> in 6, recurrent nerve injuries in 4, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010310'>chylothorax</z:hpo> in 2, and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Surgical intervention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004954'>descending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> still has its unique advantages and indications; surgical safety is markedly improved by the use of deep hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> </plain></SENT>
