<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite the fundamentally different origins, both diseases share common clinical symptoms in the connective tissue such as long bone <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo>, whereas they differ in others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin-1 contains approximately 13% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32460">cysteine residues</z:chebi> and can be modified by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report here that homocysteinylation affects functional properties of fibrillin-1 and tropoelastin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used recombinant fragments spanning the entire fibrillin-1 molecule to demonstrate that homocysteinylation, but not cysteinylation leads to abnormal self-interaction, which was attributed to a reduced amount of multimerization of the fibrillin-1 C terminus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The deposition of the fibrillin-1 network by human dermal fibroblasts was greatly reduced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>, but not by cysteine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, homocysteinylation, but not cysteinylation of elastin-like <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> resulted in modified coacervation properties </plain></SENT>
