<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) mutations are associated with a broad spectrum of disorders including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) and show great clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An underrepresentation for mutations leading to premature termination codon (PTC) in FBN1 exons 24-32 was found in neonatal or severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> but the underlying cause was unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study thoroughly examined two FBN1 mutations on exons 24-32 region to illustrate the molecular mechanisms underlying these FBN1 mutations on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two nucleotide substitutions, c.3208G&gt; C, the last nucleotide of exon 26, and c.3209A&gt;G, the first nucleotide of exon 27, affecting the same amino acid, p.D1070H and p.D1070G, respectively, gave very different phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that c.3208G&gt;C generates two alternatively spliced transcripts, while c.3209A&gt;G does not affect the splicing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We further demonstrate that the aberrantly spliced transcripts do not go through nonsense-mediated decay, but rather produce unstable, premature protein <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> that are degraded by endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanism outlined here defines a model for the pathogenesis of PTC-containing mutation within the exons 24-32 of FBN1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our data suggest that PTC mutation within this region may lead to early <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> in neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
