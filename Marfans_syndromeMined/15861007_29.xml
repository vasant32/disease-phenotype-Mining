<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FBN1 at 15q21.1 was found to cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in 1991, and in 2004 TGFBR2 at 3p24.1 was newly identified as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> type II gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several studies implied that fibrillin-1 and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling are functionally related in extracellular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Identification of TGFBR2 mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> type II provided the direct evidence of the relation in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: More than 500 FBN1 mutations have been found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, tentative genotype - phenotype correlations have emerged, and mouse models are providing insight into pathogenic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TGFBR2 mutations are still limited, however, in 2005 were also reported to cause a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional association between fibrillin-1 and TGF-beta signaling in extracellular matrix has been presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: This review focuses on recent molecular genetics advances in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and overlapping <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mutation spectrum of FBN1 and TGFBR2 in relation to phenotype is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Functional relation between fibrillin-1 and TGF-beta signaling is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future prospects in the study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> are presented </plain></SENT>
