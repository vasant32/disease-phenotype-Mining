<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Composite grafts were used in 28 patients (54%; group I) and other procedures on the ascending aorta in 24 patients (46%; group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The latter included supracoronary graft replacement with or without aortic valve replacement or reconstruction (n = 13), and reconstruction of the ascending aorta with or without aortic valve replacement (n = 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Composite graft insertion was combined with mitral valve surgery at the same operation in 3 patients (6%) </plain></SENT>
