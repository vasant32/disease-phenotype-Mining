<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have characterized approximately 6.9-kb of the estimated 10-kb fibrillin transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have now completed the primary structure of fibrillin, elucidated the exon/intron organization of the gene and derived a physical map of the genetic locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pre-fibrillin consists of 2,871 amino acids which, excluding the signal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, are arranged into five structurally distinct regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The largest of these regions comprises about 75% of the entire protein and consists of numerous repeated cysteine-rich sequences homologous to the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> motifs of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor-beta binding protein (TGF-bp) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-three of the forty-six EGF-like repeats contain a calcium binding consensus sequence (EGF-CB) conceivably mediating protein-protein interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin exhibits a few additional cysteine-rich modules that are apparently unique to this <z:chebi fb="4" ids="33839">macromolecule</z:chebi> and may represent evolutionary variants of the EGF-CB and TGF-bp motifs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the cysteine-rich repeats are encoded by single exons; consequently, the fibrillin gene is relatively large (approximately 110-kb) and highly fragmented (65 exons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the fibrillin gene and relevant information for the full characterization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> mutations </plain></SENT>
