<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to investigate the mechanical properties or compliance of the aorta in these subjects and compare them with a healthy age- and sex-matched reference population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: An ultrasound phase-locked echo-tracking system was used to determine diameter and pulsatile diameter change of the infrarenal aorta in nine subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> which were then compared with the values for 165 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compliance, defined as the inverse of Ep (pressure strain elastic modulus) or stiffness (beta), was calculated from pulsatile diameter change and blood pressure obtained by the auscultatory method with a sphygmomanometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For statistical analysis confidence intervals (95%) obtained from the healthy controls were used for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed for the female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sample size for males (n = 2) was too small for the latter analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and their confidence intervals, subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> had an increased Ep and stiffness (beta) and decreased strain (fractional diameter change) in the infrarenal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ANCOVA in the female patients showed increased beta (p &lt; 0.01) and Ep (p &lt; 0.01) and a decreased strain (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aortic diameters, MAP, as well as the pulse pressure, were similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This investigation demonstrates alterations in the mechanical properties of the aorta in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> in the form of increased stiffness of the aortic wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This may be of importance in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and rupture </plain></SENT>
