<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the unexplained features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> is the pathogenic mechanism that leads to marked inter- and intra-familial clinical variability, despite complete disease penetrance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An FBN1 deletion patient [46,XXdel(15)(q15q22.1)] was identified whose fibrillin-1 protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were significantly higher than expected for a single FBN1 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This suggested that allelic variation in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> FBN1 expression might occur in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> families, and have potential clinical implications particularly for those with premature termination codon (PTC) mutations who usually display low levels of expression from the mutant allele due to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> analyses identified a variable reduction in total FBN1 transcript (78+/-2.2 to 27.3+/-2.3%) in three related individuals carrying PTC-causing mutation 932insT, compared with unaffected control individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both pulse chase analysis of fibrillin-1 biosynthesis and RNase protection analyses demonstrated that these differences were due to variation in the expression of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> FBN1 allele and not NMD of mutant <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We suggest that differences in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> FBN1 expression could contribute to the clinical variability seen in this family with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, and should be considered as a potential modifier of phenotype in other cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
