<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL FEATURES: A Cesarean delivery was performed under deep general anesthesia with high-dose opioid administration to avoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> during tracheal intubation and obstetric surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Delivery took place less than five minutes after induction of anesthesia, and tracheal intubation of the newborn was required due to opioid-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002791'>hypoventilation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, aortic arch repair was performed in the mother after connection to extracorporal bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite extensive replacement of coagulation factors, severe vaginal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> persisted after weaning from extracorporal bypass, and the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> stopped only after a hysterectomy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, after a short period in the intensive care unit, mother and child were discharged from hospital in excellent condition ten days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Deep general anesthesia for emergency Cesarean delivery while accepting the risk of respiratory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in the newborn is a viable option for the <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> management of life-threatening events such as Stanford type A dissection </plain></SENT>
