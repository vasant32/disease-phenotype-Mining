<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>Aortic dilatation</z:hpo> can be lethal for young competitive athletes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence among athletes is not known, however, and thus a reasonable approach to early recognition remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Echocardiograms of 1929 normotensive athletes 15 to 34 years of age were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five (0.26%) athletes had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo>; 4 of the 5 played basketball </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This made the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> 0.96% (4 of 415) among basketball and volleyball players, who represented a population of especially tall athletes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tallness aside, only 2 of the 5 athletes had features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the athletes without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo>, the relation between body surface area and aortic root dimension was nonlinear and best described with a quadratic regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Athletes with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> fell well outside the 95% confidence interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Because a higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> is to be anticipated among very tall athletes, inclusion of echocardiography in screening before participation in certain sports should be considered </plain></SENT>
