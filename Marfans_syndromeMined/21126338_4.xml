<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a key role in tissue formation, homeostasis and repair, mutations in ECM components have catastrophic consequences for organ function and therefore, for the fitness and survival of the organism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Collagen, fibrillin and elastin polymers represent the architectural scaffolds that impart specific mechanic properties to tissues and organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin assemblies (microfibrils) have the additional function of distributing, concentrating and modulating local transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signals that regulate a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001050'>plethora</z:hpo> of cellular activities, including ECM formation and remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fibrillins also contain binding sites for integrin receptors, which induce adaptive responses to changes in the extracellular microenvironment by reorganizing the cytoskeleton, controlling gene expression, and releasing and activating matrix-bound latent TGF-β complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genetic evidence has indicated that fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 contribute differently to the organization and structural properties of non-collagenous architectural scaffolds, which in turn translate into discrete regulatory outcomes of locally released TGF-β and BMP signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the study of congenital dysfunctions of fibrillin-1 has yielded insights into the pathogenesis of acquired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> of the connective tissue, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the one hand, mutations that affect the structure or expression of fibrillin-1 perturb microfibril biogenesis, stimulate improper latent TGF-β activation, and give rise to the pleiotropic manifestations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, mutations located around the integrin-binding site of fibrillin-1 perturb cell matrix interactions, architectural matrix assembly and extracellular distribution of latent TGF-β complexes, and lead to the highly restricted fibrotic phenotype of Stiff Skin syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Understanding the molecular similarities and differences between congenital and acquired forms of <z:mp ids='MP_0009932'>skin fibrosis</z:mp> may therefore provide new therapeutic tools to mitigate or even prevent disease progression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> and perhaps other fibrotic conditions </plain></SENT>
