<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elastic properties of the aorta with primary MVP may be expected to be increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the aortic elasticity in the primary form of MVP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty male patients with a primary form of MVP not having any sign of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and joint hyperlaxity syndrome and twenty healthy individuals were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aortic strain, aortic distensibility index and aortic stiffness index were calculated by using aortic diameters obtained by echocardiography and blood pressures measured by sphygmomanometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When comparing the MVP group and the control group it was found that the aortic stiffness index was increased (P &lt; 0.05) whereas the aortic distensibility and strain index were decreased (P &lt; 0.05) in the MVP group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the characteristics of the groups (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We concluded that the elastic properties of the aorta were decreased in the primary form of MVP, unexpectedly.Therefore, results of decreased aortic elasticity should also be followed up in patients with MVP </plain></SENT>
