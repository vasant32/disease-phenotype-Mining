<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: twenty-one family members, including seven patients underwent general physical and fully ophthalmic examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes of venous blood of these individuals in the family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and direct sequencing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 65 coding exons of the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mutation screening in FBN1 identified a T&gt;C transition at nucleotide position c,1759 leading to substitution of Cysteine for Arginine at codon 587 (C587R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This nucleotide substitution was not seen in any unaffected member of the family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We detected a novel mutation in FBN1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our result expands the mutation spectrum of FBN1 and help in the study of the molecular pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and Marfan-related diseases </plain></SENT>
