<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unusual in younger patients and its presence has been traditionally associated with trauma, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> and pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Heavy weightlifting and other fibrillinopathies have been also implicated in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present here the case of a 26-year-old male with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> type A (De Bakey II), without family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e> and signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: The patient is a 26-year-old Caucasian Greek male who was presented in the emergency department with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computerized tomography with contrast material showed the presence of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> with the question of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection type A (De Bakey II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient was emergently operated with replacement of the affected aortic segment and he had an uneventful clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three years follow up is essentially <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although extremely rare, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> is always a possibility in the differential diagnosis of chest and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo> in young patients and should be thoroughly investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of an associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> makes the possibility even higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The disease, if undiagnosed, carries the same mortality rates as in the older population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prompt surgical intervention offers a possible cure and long term survival benefit for the patients </plain></SENT>
