<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>Ectopia lentis</z:hpo> continues to be a perplexing diagnostic and therapeutic problem for most ophthalmologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, thorough investigation, both systemic and ocular, can in most cases, establish either an environmental etiology or the nature of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heritable disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo>, the ophthalmologist should insure that each patient obtains adequate consultation with other specialists in order that proper prophylactic and therapeutic measures are available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo>, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265313" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Weill-Marchesani</z:e> together account for the majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>dislocated lenses</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each of these requires a somewhat different therapeutic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>Glaucoma</z:hpo> should be recognized as a frequent complication in each of these conditions but is most serious in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265313" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Weill-Marchesani syndrome</z:e> in which it often occurs early in life and remains unrecognized until serious damage has occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1273758" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pupillary-block</z:e> nature of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> in this condition, a prophylactic peripheral iridectomy must be seriously considered in every case while lens surgery should be undertaken if the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> cannot be controlled by medical or surgical means </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo>, because of the potential vascular complications of general anesthesia, the ophthalmologist is often in a dilemma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The lens in this condition seems to be more mobile than in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> disorders and therefore likely to compromise vision earlier in life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, due to the risk of vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, lens surgery should be delayed whenever possible until the patient is old enough to tolerate local anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Likewise, patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> should be handled conservatively and, in general, function quite well simple with spectacle correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Due to the high frequency of immediate surgical complications, it is advisable to avoid an open-sky technique to lens removal, using <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> or a pars plana approach instead </plain></SENT>
