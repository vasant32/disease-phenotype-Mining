<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A register of affected persons was established based on information provided from medical records and files in a nation-wide retrospective study, the Danish ECL-study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three hundred and ninety-six cases (197 males, 199 females) with ECL were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By January 1st, 1993, the estimated prevalence rate of ECL was 6.4/100,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The estimated average point prevalence rate at birth 1976-85 was 0.83/10,000 live born </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only in 69% of the cases (274/396) was a nosologic classification possible, based on preexisting information about familial occurrence, systemic and ocular findings: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> was found in 68.2% of these (187/274), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> et pupillae in 21.2%, simple dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> in 8.0%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo> in 1.1%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003643'>sulfite oxidase deficiency</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265313" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Weill-Marchesani syndrome</z:e> in 0.7% each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 31% (122/396) a nosologic diagnosis could not be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The majority of affected persons have congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> as a manifestation of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is therefore essential to evaluate ECL patients systemically with a general physical examination, a metabolic screening, and an echocardiography as a minimum, in order to make a nosologic diagnosis and to prevent potentially life-threatening systemic complications </plain></SENT>
