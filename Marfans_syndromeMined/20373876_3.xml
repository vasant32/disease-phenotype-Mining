<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000563'>Keratoconus</z:hpo> is a degenerating disease of the eye that results in an irregularly-shaped cornea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiology of the disease is unknown and the prognosis is difficult due to the variability in outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000563'>Keratoconus</z:hpo> has been associated with eye rubbing, atopy, contact lens wear, as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic conditions</z:e>, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down's syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thinning of the cornea in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000563'>keratoconus</z:hpo> has been well studied and is documented to occur as a result of degradation of corneal collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reason for this tissue degradation is unknown but has been hypothesized to be linked with proteases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study used a literature search to review the role of proteases and inflammatory molecules in the aetiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000563'>keratoconus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Early studies demonstrated elevated levels of collagenolytic and gelatinolytic activities in laboratory cultures of keratoconic corneas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent proteins that include collagenases and gelatinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MMPs levels are altered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000563'>keratoconus</z:hpo> corneas compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> corneas and the level of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) is decreased in keratoconic corneas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have demonstrated the involvement of Cathepsin B, G, and K in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000563'>keratoconus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although thought to be a non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e>, inflammatory molecules, such as interleukins and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor have been shown to be elevated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000563'>keratoconus</z:hpo>, and these inflammatory molecules may mediate production and activation of proteases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Proteases may be implicated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000563'>keratoconus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An in-depth investigation of these proteases may help in better understanding the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
