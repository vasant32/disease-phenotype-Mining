<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To study age-related change in aortic stiffness in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) versus healthy volunteers using velocity-encoded (VE) MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients (age range, 18-63 years; mean age 36 ± 14 years, 13 men) and 25 age-/gender-matched healthy volunteers were examined with VE-MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aortic stiffness was expressed by pulse wave velocity (PWV), assessed in the proximal and distal part of the aorta and in the total aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PWV was compared between patients and volunteers and age-relation was determined by linear regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PWV was significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parts of the aorta in patients when compared with healthy volunteers (proximal aorta 5.7 ± 1.5 m/s versus 4.8 ± 0.9 m/s, distal aorta 6.4 ± 2.4 m/s versus 5.0 ± 1.2 m/s and total aorta 5.9 ± 1.7 m/s versus 4.9 ± 1.1 m/s, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PWV correlated significantly with age (Pearson R between 0.45 and 0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only in the proximal aorta, the increase in PWV with age was significantly higher in patients (7 ± 2 cm/s increase with age) than in volunteers (3 ± 1 cm/s increase, P = 0.03); in the distal or total aorta, the increase in PWV with age was not different between patients and volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Velocity-encoded MRI detects more pronounced age-related aortic stiffening in the proximal aorta in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients versus healthy volunteers, suggesting more severe wall disease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
