<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most recent diagnostic advances comprise noninvasive tissue characterization of the aortic wall, immunofluorescence studies or pulse chase analyses of skin and cultured dermal fibroblasts, and molecular analysis at the cDNA/DNA level of the fibrillin-1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>New diagnostic insights have eventually led to revised nosologic criteria for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic reliability as well as the advantage and limitation of these recent diagnostic strategies are discussed; moreover diagnostic concepts for patients with neonatal as well as classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> are presented and discussed in the context of the clinical management during adolescence, gravidity as well as in the pre- and postoperative patient </plain></SENT>
