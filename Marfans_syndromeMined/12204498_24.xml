<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Few data exist on the clinical manifestations and outcomes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in an elderly patient cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We categorized 550 patients with type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> enrolled in the International Registry of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic Dissection</z:hpo> into two age strata (&lt;70 and &gt;or=70 years) and compared their clinical features, management, and in-hospital events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-two percent of patients with type A dissection were aged &gt;or=70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> was exclusively associated with dissection in the young, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and iatrogenic dissection predominated in older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Typical symptoms (abrupt <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of chest or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo>) and signs (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> murmur or pulse deficits) of dissection were less common among the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fewer elderly patients were managed surgically than younger patients (64% vs. 86%, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>Hypotension</z:hpo> occurred more frequently (46% vs. 32%, p = 0.002) and focal neurologic deficits less frequently (18% vs. 26%, p = 0.04) among the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In-hospital mortality was higher among older patients (43% vs. 28%, p = 0.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis identified age &gt;or=70 years as an independent predictor of hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (odds ratio 1.7, 95% confidence interval 1.1-2.8; p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows significant differences between older (age &gt;or=70 years) and younger (age &lt;70 years) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in their clinical characteristics, management, and hospital outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future research should evaluate strategies to improve outcomes in this high-risk elderly cohort </plain></SENT>
