<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 130 patients with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, CT level was high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 120 of them (92%), CEA level was also high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a positive correlation between levels of CT and of CEA, and both assays should be included in the preoperative examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following removal of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>, normalisation of CEA levels takes several weeks, in contrast to CT where normalisation is rapid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, these estimations may be used to detect familial forms at a subclinical stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This enabled us to detect 16 new cases of MCT amongst 77 subjects studied </plain></SENT>
