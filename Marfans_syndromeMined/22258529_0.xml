<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their clinical features were not typical of any known familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients had multiple painful <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromas</z:hpo>, including bilateral orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0009732'>plexiform neurofibromas</z:hpo>, and spinal as well as mucosal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, they exhibited a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001519'>marfanoid habitus</z:hpo>, shared similar facial features, and had enlarged corneal nerves as well as neuronal migration defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comprehensive NF1, NF2 and SMARCB1 mutation analyses revealed no mutation in blood lymphocytes and in schwann cells cultured from <z:hpo ids='HP_0009732'>plexiform neurofibromas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no mutations in RET, PRKAR1A, PTEN and other <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>-pathway genes were found in blood leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Collectively, the clinical and pathological findings in these four cases fit no known syndrome and likely represent a new disorder </plain></SENT>
