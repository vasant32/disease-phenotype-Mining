<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The two domains are in a rigid, rod-like arrangement, stabilized by interdomain calcium binding and hydrophobic interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We propose a model for the arrangement of fibrillin monomers in microfibrils that reconciles structural and antibody binding data, and we describe a set of disease-causing mutations that provide the first clues to the specificity of cbEFG interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The residues involved in stabilizing the domain linkage are highly conserved in fibrillin, fibulin, thrombomodulin, and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We propose that the relative orientation of tandem cbEGF domains in these proteins is similar, but that in others, including Notch, pairs adopt a completely different conformation </plain></SENT>
