<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>2) Bentall operation is indicated to the cases with a) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, b) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with thin wall and c) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> from dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>3) In the technique using composite graft, wrapping with aneurysmal wall is not always necessary and sinus-shaped composite graft is an advantage to prosthetic valve motion, reducing tension around the coronary artery anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>4) Aorto-coronary bypass should be combined with Bentall operation in the cases with coronary ostium involved by dissection and displaced coronary ostium </plain></SENT>
