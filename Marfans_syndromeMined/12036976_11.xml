<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate corneal thickness, curvature, and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> with the Orbscan Topography System I (Bausch &amp; Lomb, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) and to study <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> with in vivo confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This prospective, clinical, comparative case series included 60 eyes of 31 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and 32 eyes of 17 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First, biomicroscopic examination was conducted to search for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, mean keratometry and ocular refractive power were calculated by the autokeratorefractometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In each group, the Orbscan System I mean (and mean simulated) keratometry and pachymetric measurements (at the central location and at eight midperipheral locations) were obtained and compared, and correlations were established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo confocal microscopy was performed to evaluate tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and Z-scan analysis of 14 thin <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> corneas compared with 14 control corneas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant decrease (ANOVA, P &lt; 0.0001) of mean simulated keratometry measurement appeared in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> group (sim K, 40.8 +/- 1.4 D) compared with the control group (42.9 +/- 1.1 D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pachymetry in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> group was significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.0001) compared with that in the control group, in the center (respectively, 502 +/- 41.9 microm and 552 +/- 23.6 microm) and the eight midperipheral locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>Ectopia lentis</z:hpo> was highly linked with mean keratometry and pachymetry (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Confocal microscopy performed on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>-affected <z:mp ids='MP_0005543'>thin corneas</z:mp> confirmed the <z:mp ids='MP_0005543'>corneal thinning</z:mp> and showed an opaque stromal matrix, and Z-scan profiles were abnormal with increased stromal back scattering of light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> is known to be associated with a flattened cornea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated an association with <z:mp ids='MP_0005543'>corneal thinning</z:mp> and described confocal microscopy findings in this syndrome </plain></SENT>
