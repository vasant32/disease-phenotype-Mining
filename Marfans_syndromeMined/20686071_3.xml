<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin-1, the main component of microfibrils, is a 350-kDa <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> for which genetic haploinsufficiency in humans can lead to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, a severe polyfeatured pathology including <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and dissections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microfibrils and fibrillin-1 fragments mediate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of several cell types, including endothelial cells, while fibrillin-1 additionally triggers lung and mesangial cell migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, fibrillin-1-induced intracellular signaling is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have studied the signaling events induced in human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVECs) by aortic microfibrils as well as recombinant fibrillin-1 Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-containing fragments PF9 and PF14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aortic microfibrils and PF14, not PF9, substantially and dose dependently increased HUVEC cytoplasmic and nuclear calcium levels measured using the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="51121">fluorescent dye</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5107">Fluo-3</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect of PF14 was confirmed in bovine aortic endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PF14 action in HUVECs was mediated by αvβ3 and α5β1 integrins, phospholipase-C, inosital 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and mobilization of intracellular calcium stores, whereas membrane calcium channels were not or only slightly implicated, as shown in patch-clamp experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, PF14 enhanced endothelial cell proliferation and migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hence, fibrillin-1 sequences may physiologically activate endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Genetic fibrillin-1 deficiency could alter <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> endothelial signaling and, since endothelium dysfunction is an important contributor to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, participate in the arterial anomalies associated with this developmental disease </plain></SENT>
