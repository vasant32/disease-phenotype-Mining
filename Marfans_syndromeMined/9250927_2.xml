<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography demonstrated <z:mp ids='MP_0010470'>dilated ascending aorta</z:mp> with a circular shape intimal flap at the root level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the patient required transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), but during esophageal intubation, the patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pericardial tamponade</z:e> which resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in spite of cardiopulmonary resuscitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although, some investigators recommend TEE as the first choice of diagnostic method of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, hemodynamic stability is very important during TEE study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, aggressive sedation may be required in the case of circumferential dissection of the ascending aorta to prevent the increases of the blood pressure and the heart rate which suggested an extensive tear of the aortic intima during TEE procedure </plain></SENT>
