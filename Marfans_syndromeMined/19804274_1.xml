<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although complications of the syndrome may involve the eye, the lung and the skeleton, the high mortality of untreated cases results almost exclusively from cardiovascular complications, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, a series of experiments has begun to elucidate the complex molecular etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and a number of new heritable syndromes with an associated risk for aortic complications, such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome types I and II, have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The multiorgan involvement of many of these syndromes requires multidisciplinary expert centers that can increase the average life expectancy of affected patients from only 32 years to over 60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present article both reviews classical standards of managing cardiovascular manifestations and outlines significant advances in recent research with focus on their impact on future diagnostic and therapeutic options </plain></SENT>
