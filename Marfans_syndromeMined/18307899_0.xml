<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the management of pregnancy and cardiovascular complications in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From October 1994 to September 2006, 30 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> undergoing cardiovascular surgery were studied retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the labor of 46 offsprings given birth by 30 women, 5 cases (11%) were performed elective cesarean section because of the existence of aortic complication, and 12 (26%) were diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The gestation in two patients was terminated due to deterioration of aortic abnormalities during their third trimester, and they received surgical treatment with Bentall procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> during labor and post delivery respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the manipulation of anticoagulation peripartum, one who had the implantation with mechanical prosthesis went through pregnancy and delivery uneventfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average duration between delivery and cardiovascular surgery was (15 +/- 9) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vaginal delivery can be done safely in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> who do not have or have mild cardiovascular system abnormalities, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, or other important <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo>, cesarean section should be the preferred method of delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> are at increased risk for dissection and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> during pregnancy and should be counseled before pregnancy about these risks, as well as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of the condition </plain></SENT>
