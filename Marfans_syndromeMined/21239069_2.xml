<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although β-blockers remain the standard of preventive treatment, preliminary results from animal studies and a selected group of severely affected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> children show significant benefit from treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi>, an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor blocker with TGF-β inhibiting potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Large-scale human trials are now needed to confirm these results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This trial aims to evaluate the combined effect of both drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We are conducting a prospective randomized placebo controlled double blind phase III study aiming to include 174 MFS patients (age ≥ 10 years and z-score ≥ 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients already taking β-blockers are randomized for weight-adjusted treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> versus placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint is decrease in aortic root growth rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints are <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>/surgery, progression of aortic/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo>, arterial stiffness, left ventricular systolic/diastolic function, quality of life and genetic modifiers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography, vascular echo-Doppler and quality of life assessment will be performed at baseline and at 6-monthly follow-ups for 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MRI evaluation will be performed at baseline and at the end of the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This trial will study new therapeutic strategies for the prevention of serious cardiovascular complications in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The uniqueness in our trial is that the additive effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> and β-blocker will be evaluated in a large spectrum of disease severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A combination of ultrasound and MRI will allow detailed evaluation of anatomic and functional properties of the aorta and left ventricle </plain></SENT>
