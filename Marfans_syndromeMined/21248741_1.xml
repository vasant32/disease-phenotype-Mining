<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the gene encoding smooth muscle cell alpha actin (ACTA2) have recently been shown to cause familial thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> leading to type A dissections (TAAD) and predispose to premature <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to further explore the role of ACTA2 variations in the pathogenesis of TAAD, we sequenced the coding regions of this gene in 40 unrelated German patients with TAAD (with (n=21) or without (n=19) clinical features suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had previously tested negative for mutations in the FBN1 and TGFBR2 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified three novel ACTA2 mutations and mapped them on a three-dimensional model of actin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two mutations affect residues within (M49V) or adjacent to (R39C), the DNAse-I-binding loop within subdomain 2 of alpha actin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were observed in families with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> (R39C) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (M49V) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The third mutation causes an exchange in the vicinity of the ATP-binding site (G304R) in a patient thought to have isolated TAAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the affected individuals had clinical features typical for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and no case of premature <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> was reported from the affected families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we underscore the role of ACTA2 mutations in nonsyndromic TAAD and suggest that ACTA2 should be included in the genes routinely investigated for syndromic and nonsyndromic TAAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Detailed clinical investigations of additional families are warranted to further explore the full range of phenotypic signs associated with the three novel mutations described here </plain></SENT>
