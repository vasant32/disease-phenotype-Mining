<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elevated aortic stiffness induces high systolic blood pressure, augmented pulse pressure with increased ventricular afterload, reduced subendocardial blood flow and augmented pulsatile stress in the peripheral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Factors with relevant impact on the epidemiology of arterial stiffness are widely spread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>3 major groups of parameters influencing the stiffness of the aorta and the large arteries have been studied and described up to now: (i) physiological properties like age, gender, body height, pressure, hormonal state, genetic factors; (ii) environmental factors like nutrition (fish-, salt-, garlic consumption), smoking, performance of sports and aerobic capacity; (iii) diseases like <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, cerebrovascular disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan-syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000824'>growth hormone deficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Close association between several of these factors impedes analyzing them independently from each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age and blood pressure were found to be the most prominent predictors of arterial stiffness in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> as well as in disease populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Physiological and environmental factors can modulate these effects of aging, diseases generally seem to amplify them </plain></SENT>
