<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A number of patients who require an operation for complications of annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath>, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003504" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ai">aortic incompetence</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the aortic root (or both), have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aortic valve leaflets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have treated these patients by excising the aneurysmal portion of the ascending aorta and sinuses of Valsalva but by leaving the aortic valve leaflets and some arterial wall attached to the left ventricular outflow tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aortic valve is reimplanted inside a collagen-impregnated tubular Dacron graft, similar to what is done for implantation of an aortic valve homograft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The coronary arteries are also reimplanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This operation was performed in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> and five had the stigmata of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, but one patient required composite replacement of the aortic valve and ascending aorta because of persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003504" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ai">aortic incompetence</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative Doppler echocardiography revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aortic valve function in six patients and mild incompetence in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The preliminary results of this new operation are encouraging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further investigation is necessary to establish the best size, shape, and type of material that should be used to replace the aortic root while preserving the aortic valve </plain></SENT>
