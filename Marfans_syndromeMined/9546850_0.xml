<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This makes correct interpretation of data difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to assess the determinants of hospital mortality, the results of 148 consecutive patients over a 23-year period, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> operated on for a type A dissection, were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean(s.d.) age was 56(13.1) years, 64% were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection (surgery within 14 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms) was performed in 139 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stigmata of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> were present in 6.1% (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Peripheral vascular ischaemic complications were observed in 27.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nowadays, diagnosis is primarily confirmed using transoesophageal echocardiography (75 correct diagnoses among 76 performed) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Operation consisted of repair or replacement of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Resuspension of the aortic valve was performed in 74 patients, and arch replacement in 25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 74 patients, distal repair was done under deep hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hospital mortality rate was 23.6% (35 patients), though mortality rate calculated over the period 1990-1993 was 17.4% (P = n.s.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis revealed the following variables to be statistically significant predictors of hospital mortality (P &lt; 0.05): preoperative ischaemic complications, preoperative resuscitation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1144803,C0494588" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haemopericardium</z:e>, postoperative neurological complications, rethoracotomy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0156149" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Multivariate stepwise logistic regression indicated preoperative resuscitation, postoperative haemodialysis and postoperative neurological complications as the only independent predictors of hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Dissections arising from a primary intimal tear in the descending aorta had a more favourable outcome (P = 0.06, odds ratio 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although hospital mortality has declined over the past few years, no decline was seen in operative mortality since gelatine-resourcine-formol (GRF) glue is used as a routine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Transoesophageal echocardiography is the first choice in confirming diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Early operation is advocated, with careful haemostasis, before the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac tamponade</z:e> or end-organ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, as the cornerstone of a successful treatment of a type A dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Reduction of neurological complications will further improve the results </plain></SENT>
