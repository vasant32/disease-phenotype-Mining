<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A relatively sample and reproducible analytical procedure has been devised to measure the levels of these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycosides</z:chebi> in human urine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By the use of this procedure it was shown that a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diet has only a small effect on 24-hr urinary excretion levels of these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycosides</z:chebi> indicating an endogenous origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycoside</z:chebi> levels appear to be highest in children, roughly paralleling collagen turnover as indicated by urinary <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18095">hydroxyproline</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Collagen turnover equivalents calculated from urinary hydroxylysyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycoside</z:chebi> levels were found to be significantly larger than collagen turnover equivalents calculated from urinary <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18095">hydroxyproline</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This suggests that urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycosides</z:chebi> are more quantitative indicators of collagen metabolism than urinary <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18095">hydroxyproline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ratio of Hyl-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17234">Glc</z:chebi> to Hyl-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> was measured in urines of diseased as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and a bimodal distribution was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Alkaline hydrolysates of different human connective tissue collagens showed that only bone collagen, of the collagens examined, had a low ratio of Hyl-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17234">Glc</z:chebi> to Hyl-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> compared to human urine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other collagens examined had higher ratios than found in human urine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these results it is postulated that the bimodal distribution of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycoside</z:chebi> ratios represents two populations of collagen turnover, the lower ratio population having a high bone collagen turnover, the lower ratio population having a high bone collagen turnover relative to the second population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Examination of the types of subjects making up the two populations supports this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that urinary O-hydroxylysyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycoside</z:chebi> excretion, in addition to providing a more quantitative estimate of collagen turnover than urinary <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18095">hydroxyproline</z:chebi>, may prove to be of value as a specific means of studying the metabolism of bone collagen </plain></SENT>
