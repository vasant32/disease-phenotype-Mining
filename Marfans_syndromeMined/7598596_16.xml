<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigates the experience with the technique since its conception by our group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1982 and 1994, 80 elephant trunks were implanted in 72 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 40 cases the primary position was in the proximal descending thoracic aorta, extending an aortic arch graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 32 instances the elephant trunk was placed in the distal descending thoracic aorta, extending descending aortic replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aortic pathology comprised <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in 22 cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection in 47, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a total of 10 early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, 7 of which occurred during the early experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subsequent downstream aortic operation was undertaken in 24 patients after a mean interval of 14 months, replacing the descending thoracic aorta in 17 cases and the thoracoabdominal portion in 7 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six patients underwent third-stage procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Several technical modifications were developed, helping to ease placement and unfolding of the trunk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The elephant trunk technique greatly facilitates and at the same time reduces the risk of multiple-stage aortic replacement </plain></SENT>
