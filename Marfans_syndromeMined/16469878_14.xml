<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the identity and function of many microfibril-associated molecules essential for vascular development and function have yet to be characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our morpholino-based screen for members of the secretome required for vascular development, we identified a key player in microfibril formation in zebrafish embryogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microfibril-associated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-1 (MAGP1) is a conserved protein found in mammalian and zebrafish microfibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of magp1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is detected in microfibril-producing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of a functional Magp1-mRFP fusion protein reveals localization along the midline and in the vasculature during embryogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Underexpression and overexpression analyses demonstrate that specific Magp1 protein levels are critical for vascular development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Integrin function is compromised in magp1 morphant embryos, suggesting that reduced integrin-matrix interaction is the main mechanism for the vascular defects in magp1 morphants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We further show that Magp1 and fibrillin-1 interact in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study implicates MAGP1 as a key player in microfibril formation and integrity during development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The essential role for MAGP1 in vascular morphogenesis and function also supports a wide range of clinical applications, including therapeutic targets in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> and cardiovascular tissue engineering </plain></SENT>
