<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 71 patients(42 males, 29 females, mean age 61.4 +/- 10.0 years) with AAD, undergoing coronary angiography between 1988 and 1999, were studied including 38 patients with open communication type and 33 patients with thrombosed type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to the Stanford classification, 18 patients were type A and 53 patients were type B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with AAD following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> or chest trauma were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Selective coronary angiography was performed in age- and sex-matched patients with AAA(n = 57; 42 males, 15 females, mean age 63.9 +/- 4.6 years) or ASO (n = 95; 66 males, 29 females, mean age 62.4 +/- 9.4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>Coronary artery disease</z:hpo> was defined as &gt; or = 75% stenosis (left main trunk lesion of &gt; or = 50% stenosis) by multidirectional imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> was demonstrated in 14 patients with AAD (19.7%), 25 patients with AAA (43.9%), and 49 patients with ASO (51.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> was significantly lower in the AAD group than in the other two groups (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One-vessel disease was present in approximately 70% of the patients with AAD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, multivessel disease was observed in approximately 50% of patients with AAA and ASO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Classification of the patients with AAD according to the blood flow in the false lumen showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> was more highly associated with the thrombosed type [10 (30.3%) of 33 patients] than the open communication type [4 (10.5%) of 38 patients] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis of the patients with AAD showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> was associated with a high serum total cholesterol level (p = 0.025) and the thrombosed type (p = 0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> was significantly lower among patients with AAD than among age- and sex-matched patients with AAA or ASO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>Coronary artery disease</z:hpo> developed in 30% of the patients with the thrombosed type of AAD, although the prognosis seemed to be good </plain></SENT>
