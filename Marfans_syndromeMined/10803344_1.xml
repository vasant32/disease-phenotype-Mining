<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An association between anterior chest wall deformities and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> is described in the literature but is poorly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It appears that only approximately 4% to 5% of patients with severe anterior chest wall deformities have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> of sufficient magnitude to warrant evaluation and observation by a spinal deformity physician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship between anterior chest wall deformity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> is most clear in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Marfan patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> are at high risk for progression of deformity to unacceptable levels and have historically not responded well to brace therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The causes of anterior chest wall deformity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> remain unclear, although unbalanced cartilage growth has been proposed as a potential cause of both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some have proposed that chest wall deformity may result in asymmetric spinal forces and subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> secondary to altered spinal growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because of the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000766'>pectus deformities</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, patients with anterior chest wall deformities should be carefully examined for signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> and have screening radiographs if indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Young patients in particular should be referred to a spinal deformity physician, because it is clear that patients who present with spinal deformity prior to age 5 years are the ones at risk for adverse cardiopulmonary sequelae related to spinal deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> and anterior chest wall deformities need only observation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In more severe cases, the management of spinal deformity traditionally involves the use of bracing to attempt to control curves of lesser magnitude and surgical management for unacceptable deformities or curves of magnitudes too great for brace treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There are no studies that specifically address the use of these methods in patients with both anterior chest wall deformities and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> in patients with anterior chest wall deformities follows treatment principles outlined for idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
