<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Clinical and necropsy findings are described in 56 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>: 15 patients, aged 16 to 69 years (mean 39), died suddenly and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> was the only cardiac condition found at necropsy (hereafter called isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>); the remaining 41 patients had other conditions that were capable of being fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the latter 41 patients, 7, aged 17 to 59 years (mean 45), had associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo>, and 34 patients, aged 17 to 70 years (mean 52), had no associated congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared with the 34 patients without associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> and with nonmitral valve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> conditions capable in themselves of being fatal, the 15 patients who died suddenly with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> were younger (mean age 39 +/- 17 versus 52 +/- 15 years; p = 0.01), more often women (67% versus 26%; p = 0.008) and had a lower frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (7% versus 38%; p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 15 patients dying suddenly with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> also were less likely to have evidence of ruptured chordae tendineae (29% versus 67%; p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0002833'>increased heart weight</z:mp> (67% versus 59%), a dilated mitral valve anulus (80% versus 81%), a dilated tricuspid valve anulus (17% versus 17%), an elongated anterior mitral leaflet (86% versus 54%), an elongated posterior mitral leaflet (79% versus 77%) and fibrous endocardial plaque under the posterior mitral leaflet (73% versus 63%) was similar between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The severity of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> (mild 20% versus 11%; moderate 27% versus 58%; severe 53% versus 32%) also was similar between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> dying suddenly without another recognized condition tend to be relatively young women without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
