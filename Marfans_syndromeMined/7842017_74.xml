<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Now, using chimaeric constructs in a model in vivo expression system, premature termination codons are identified as determinants of splice site selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nonsense codon recognition prior to <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> splicing necessitates the ability to read the frame of precursor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We propose that maintenance of an open reading frame can serve as an additional level of scrutiny during exon definition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This process may have pathogenic and evolutionary significance </plain></SENT>
