<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Mutations in the genes encoding fibrillin-1 (FBN1) and transforming growth factor beta receptor type II (TGFBR2) are known causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) and related disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a sound correlation between the genotype and the cardiovascular phenotype has not yet been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to identify novel mutations in FBN1 and TGFBR2 and to assess whether the type of mutation is linked to a particular clinical subtype of the cardiovascular condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical records of 36 patients referred to us for molecular genetic diagnosis were reviewed to assess the course and severity of the vascular deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A semiautomatic protocol was established enabling a rapid and cost-effective screening of the genes FBN1 and TGFBR2 by direct sequencing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> coding exons and flanking intronic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Novel mutations in FBN1 and TGFBR2 were detected in 12 and 2 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four individuals carried a recurrent mutation in FBN1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Throughout the study cohort, the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> per se did not depend on the type of mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, we found that mutations affecting the calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like domain were more frequently associated with a dissection of distal parts of the aorta than mutations that lead to a premature termination codon (chi(1)(2): p=0.013), suggesting that the spatio-temporal pattern of vascular deterioration may vary with the type of mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Detecting a mutation in the genes FBN1 and TGFBR2 proves the genetic origin of vascular findings and allows the identification of family members at risk who should undergo preventive checkups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Routine genetic testing of patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> or thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo>/dissections could provide further insight into genotype/phenotype correlations related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
