<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Particularly the true incidence of coronary ostial complications such as stenosis, kinking or pseudoaneurysm formation needs to be assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed 71 patients receiving a composite aortic conduit from November 1993 to November 1999 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (n = 51) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (n = 20), 12 of whom had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups according to variations in the surgical technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In group 1 (30 patients; 42%) the classic modified Bentall operation with the button technique was employed whereas in group 2 (41 patients; 58%) some technical modifications were added mainly consisting of a reinforcement suture joining the cut edge of the aortic wall and the prosthetic sewing ring and suture of the coronary buttons with an "endo-button" technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To detect potential procedure-related complications particularly at the coronary ostia anastomoses follow-up included transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography every 6 months and computerized tomographic angiography at 12 months or whenever indicated; in 20 patients a magnetic resonance imaging angiography and standard aortography with selective coronary angiography were also added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At a mean follow-up of 49 +/- 19 months anastomotic complications occurred in 4 patients (6%): in 2 a pseudoaneurysm developed at the distal aortic suture line and in 1 a pseudoaneurysm developed at the right coronary ostium after repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>; in 1 Marfan patient an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the left coronary ostium developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Such complications were unrelated to the two surgical techniques used in this series for reimplantaion of the coronary ostia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The modified Bentall operation is associated with an extremely low incidence of anastomotic complications particularly at the coronary ostia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More extensive use of new imaging techniques is desirable to assess the true incidence of such complications in patients receiving a composite aortic conduit </plain></SENT>
