<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in cardiac troponin T and alpha-tropomyosin have been identified in familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, as have new beta-myosin heavy chain gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The general relation between beta-myosin heavy chain gene mutations that produce a charge change versus conservative amino acid replacements and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> remains unresolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>New fibrillin 1 gene mutations have been identified in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, the neonatal form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same mutation is rarely found in more than one family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association of supravalvar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> and elastin gene mutations was further strengthened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The complexity of the relation between dystrophin mutations and the cell-specific loss of dystrophin expression can result in patients having <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>X-chromosome inactivation was shown to be the basis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in women with a single mutated dystrophin allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>New candidate genes that control cardiac morphogenesis and myocyte differentiation were proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>New evidence to support 22q11 microdeletions as a common basis of nonsyndromic conotruncal malformations was published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These studies represent an important beginning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although mutant genes have been recognized in affected individuals with various syndromes and congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo>, our understanding of how a genotype yields a given phenotype remains to be established </plain></SENT>
