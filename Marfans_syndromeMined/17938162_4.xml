<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>Ascending aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> (AA) are a common, though poorly understood medical condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To document the histological changes in a large series of human ascending AA, and to correlate these changes with clinical variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 111 ascending AA were excised at surgery over a 3 year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was received as a continuous ring of tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sections were taken from the anterior, posterior, greater and lesser curvature of the aorta and graded in a semi-quantitative fashion for the degree of elastin fragmentation, elastin loss, smooth muscle cell (SMC) loss, intimal changes and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean patient age at surgery was 58.7 (15.6) years; there were 70 men and 41 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>12 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, 34 (30.6%) had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp>), while 71 (64.0%) had a tricuspid aortic valve (<z:mp ids='MP_0010594'>TAV</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory cells were present in 28 cases (25.2%) and were confined to the adventitia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No particular region of the aortic circumference was more severely affected, however a <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp> was associated with significantly less intimal change, and less fragmentation and loss of elastic tissue compared with patients with a <z:mp ids='MP_0010594'>TAV</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Advanced age (&gt;65 years), female gender and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associated with more severe elastin degeneration and smooth muscle cell loss (p&lt;0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Results indicate a wide variation in the histological appearance in ascending AA, depending on patient characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>They suggest that the underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> pathogenesis may also be highly variable; this warrants further investigation </plain></SENT>
