<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Disorganization and fragmentation of elastic fibers, characteristic histologic findings of cardiac valves and aortas in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, are similar to the changes of elastic fibers in non-Marfan dissected aortas and idiopathic floppy valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical study using antielastin antibody showed even and diffuse staining pattern in finely disrupted elastic fibers, which could result from either immaturity and incomplete cross-linking or proteolytic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructurally, decrease of the microfibrils and round-shaped expansion of the amorphous components of elastic fibers were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These features, resembled those of the elastic fibers in animals treated with inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32568">lysyl</z:chebi> oxidase, suggest the abnormality of elastogenesis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recently, the changes in the activity of the matrix metalloproteinases are thought to be responsible for the damage to the elastic fibers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, these changes are also found in the idiopathic floppy valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further investigations are necessary to distinguish the pathogenesis between idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disorders</z:e> and cardiovascular lesions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
