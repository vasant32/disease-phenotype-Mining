<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to determine the perioperative risk factors leading to hospital mortality in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred twenty-two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> treated surgically within 48 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two perioperative risk factors were used in statistical analysis for prediction of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were investigated with univariate and multiple logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The in-hospital mortality rate including operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 12.3% (15 of 122 patients) and the actuarial survival rate (including in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) was 72%+/-6% at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis revealed 10 risk factors to be statistically significant predictors of hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>: age, year of operation (1990 to 1995), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, preoperative ST segment elevation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, preoperative shock, preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>, long operation time (&gt; 6 hours), long cardiopulmonary bypass time (&gt; 4 hours), and massive blood transfusion (&gt; 20 units) (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis confirmed preoperative ST-T segment elevation and massive blood transfusion to be statistically significant independent risk factors for hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative ST-T elevation and massive blood transfusion during operation were identified as significant independent risk factors for hospital mortality after operation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings should contribute to estimation of operative risk in individual patients </plain></SENT>
