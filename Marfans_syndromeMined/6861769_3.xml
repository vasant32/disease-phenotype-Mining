<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis could be made non-invasively in 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Important information concerning the extent of the dissection, and the presence or absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> or a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> could be obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Negative examinations were largely confined to cases where the distal thoracic aorta alone was involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a further 30 cases admitted to the coronary care unit during this period in which echocardiography was performed to rule out <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, two false-positive examinations led to aortography which demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 28 cases, echocardiographic examination was negative and none of these patients subsequently evidenced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography using both M-mode and cross-sectional techniques is a rapid and highly effective method of making an early diagnosis of thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cross-sectional echocardiography is complementary to the M-mode technique, enhancing diagnostic accuracy by improving structural recognition in a condition where the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> is often severely distorted </plain></SENT>
