<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility of magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) flow mapping in the assessment of aortic biophysical properties in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and to detect differences in biophysical properties in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-sized aorta distal to the aortic root between these patients and matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> and 23 matched control subjects underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> flow mapping in four locations in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-sized aorta (1, ascending aorta; 2, thoracic descending aorta; 3, descending aorta at the level of the diaphragm; and 4, abdominal descending aorta) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Distensibility at each location and flow wave velocity between locations were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the control subjects, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> had decreased aortic distensibility at three of the four locations (levels 1, 2, and 4; P &lt;.05) and increased flow wave velocity between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> locations (P &lt;.05) in the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, flow wave velocity was also significantly increased along the entire aortic tract beyond the aortic root (from level 1 to level 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging reveals abnormal biophysical properties of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-sized aorta in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Monitoring of these properties is relevant for evaluating disease progression and treatment options </plain></SENT>
