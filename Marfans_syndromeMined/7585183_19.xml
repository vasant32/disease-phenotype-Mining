<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Performing PCR on single blastomeres from early cleavage stage (six- to eight-cell) human embryos should, in principle, enable reliable determination of disease status for certain inherited conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, reports of misdiagnoses using this technique have diminished enthusiasm for its widespread clinical use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One principal source of error is the propensity for genome-targeted PCR to exclusively amplify one allele in reactions assaying a single heterozygous diploid cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complete reaction failure is also common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Employing the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) as a paradigm, we have developed a reliable, reverse transcription-PCR-based method of genotyping single cells that overcomes these obstacles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The technique should facilitate accurate preimplantation diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and other selected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic diseases</z:e> caused by heterozygous or compound-heterozygous mutations </plain></SENT>
