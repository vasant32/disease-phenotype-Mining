<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sequence analyses were carried out when the DNA amplification fragments of the DHPLC elution profiles showed difference from the corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elution profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two novel mutations were detected in two families with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One was a multiplex mutation in exon 55 containing a deletion mutation c.6862_6871delGGCTGTGTAG (p.Gly2288MetfsX109), a synonymous mutation (c.6861A&gt;G) and an intronic mutation c.[6871+1_6871+11delGTAAGAGGATC; 6871+34dupCATCAGAAGTGACAGTGGACA], and the other was a missense mutation in exon 20 c.2462G&gt;A (p.Cys821Tyr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that the deletion mutation c.[6862_6871delGGCTGT GTAG; 6871+1_6871+11delGTAAGAGGATC] (p.Gly2288MetfsX109) and the missense mutation c.2462G&gt;A (p.Cys821Tyr) of FBN1 gene may cause the two family patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> respectively </plain></SENT>
