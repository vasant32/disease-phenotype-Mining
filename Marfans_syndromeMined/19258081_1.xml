<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: A prospective, international registry study was initiated to provide contemporary comparative data on short-term clinical outcomes after aortic valve-sparing and aortic valve-replacing root operations in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this initial report is to describe the study design and to compare early outcomes in the first 151 enrolled patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We assessed 30-day outcomes in 151 patients who met strict Ghent diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and underwent aortic root replacement with either valve-replacing (n = 46) or valve-sparing techniques (n = 105) at one of 18 participating centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the valve replacement group, a mechanical composite valve graft was used in 39 (85%) patients and a bioprosthetic valve in 7 (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the valve-sparing group, David V procedures were performed in 57 (54%) patients, David I in 38 (36%), David IV in 8 (8%), Florida sleeve in 1 (1%), and Yacoub remodeling in 1 (1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No in-hospital or 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite longer crossclamp and cardiopulmonary bypass times in the valve-sparing group, there were no significant between-group differences in postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-day valve-related complications occurred in 2 (4%) patients undergoing valve replacement and in 3 (3%) undergoing valve-sparing procedures (P = .6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of early outcomes revealed that valve-sparing techniques were the most common approach to root replacement in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in these centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The complexity of valve-sparing root replacement did not translate into any demonstrable adverse early outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subsequent analysis will compare the 3-year durability of these two surgical approaches </plain></SENT>
