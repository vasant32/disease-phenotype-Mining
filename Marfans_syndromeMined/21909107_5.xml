<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a multistage genome-wide association study (GWAS), we compared 765 individuals who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> TAAD (STAAD) with 874 controls and identified common SNPs at a 15q21.1 locus that were associated with STAAD, with odds ratios of 1.6-1.8 that achieved genome-wide significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We followed up 107 SNPs associated with STAAD with P &lt; 1 Ã— 10(-5) in the region, in two separate STAAD cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The associated SNPs fall into a large region of linkage disequilibrium encompassing FBN1, which encodes fibrillin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FBN1 mutations cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, whose major cardiovascular complication is TAAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study shows that common genetic variants at 15q21.1 that probably act via FBN1 are associated with STAAD, suggesting a common pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and STAAD </plain></SENT>
