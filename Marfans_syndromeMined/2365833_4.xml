<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subjects were interviewed and then completed the Offer Self-Image Questionnaire and two questionnaires designed for the study </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> psychosocial adaptation on the Offer Self-Image Questionnaire </plain></SENT>
