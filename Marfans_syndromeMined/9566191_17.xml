<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effects of the removal and replacement of divalent cations on the ultrastructure of 10 to 12 nm fibrillin-1-containing microfibrils have been studied, in order to investigate the conformation of fibrillin-1 calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like (cbEGF-like) domains within the microfibril </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The NMR structure of a covalently linked pair of cbEGF-like domains from fibrillin-1 recently identified a rigid rod-like conformation for the domain pair stabilised by interdomain calcium binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This suggested that tandem arrays of fibrillin-1 cbEGF-like domains may adopt an extended conformation within a microfibril </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If correct, then removal of bound calcium from fibrillin-1 would be expected to increase the flexibility of each cbEGF-like interdomain linkage, resulting in a decrease in the length of the interbead region of the microfibril (and thus a decrease in bead to bead periodicity), a concomitant increase in its diameter, and an overall increase in the flexibility of the microfibril </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results show that removal of calcium by treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30740">EGTA</z:chebi> causes a large alteration of the microfibril structure, resulting in microfibrils with a reduced beaded periodicity, a disrupted interbead region and an increased overall flexibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These effects are readily reversible by the re-addition of calcium (in the form of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3312">CaCl2</z:chebi>), but not by the addition of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6636">MgCl2</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with conformational changes in cbEGF-like domains causing the major structural effects on the microfibril </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results provide the first direct experimental evidence to support an extended rod-like conformation for multiple tandem repeats of fibrillin-1 cbEGF-like domains within the microfibril, as predicted by the NMR structure of an isolated fibrillin-1 cbEGF-like domain pair </plain></SENT>
