<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We reviewed the long-term outcomes of aortic root replacement at Asan Medical Center and investigated the predictors affecting mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 225 consecutive adult patients undergoing aortic root replacement with mechanical conduits (n=169), porcine aortic root prosthesis (n=23), or aortic homografts (n=33) from January 1992 to September 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up duration was 6.1 years (range, 0 to 18.0 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The porcine root group was older than the other groups (freestyle 55.9±14.3 years vs. mechanical 46.3±14.6 years, homograft 48.1±14.7 years; p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mechanical group had the highest incidence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (mechanical 22%, freestyle 4%, homograft 3%; p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgery performed for infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> was more frequent in the homograft group (mechanical 10%, freestyle 10%, homograft 40%; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall 30-day mortality was 5.3% (12/225) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival rates in the mechanical, porcine root, and homograft groups were 79.4%, 81.5%, and 83.5% at 5 years and 67%, 61.9%, and 61.1% at 10 years, respectively (p=0.73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By multivariate analysis, preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, older age, and longer cardiopulmonary bypass time were independent predictors of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Incidence of postoperative complications, including infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> were comparable in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Aortic root replacement can be safely performed with different types of prostheses as the outcome was not affected by the choice of prosthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to assess the long-term durability of biological prostheses </plain></SENT>
