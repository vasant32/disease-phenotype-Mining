<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary defect in affected patients resides in the gene for fibrillin-1 (FBN1) on 15q21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Linkage analysis has shown no locus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the classic phenotype, although substantial allelic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> exists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently it has been shown that the size of the gene is approximately 200 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These and other factors have precluded routine mutation screening for presymptomatic and prenatal diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Previously we described four intragenic microsatellite polymorphisms that can be used for haplotype segregation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The utility of this approach is limited because the markers do not fully span the gene and show incomplete informativeness, with 16% homozygosity for the most common haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have now identified and localized highly polymorphic microsatellite markers that fall within 1 Mb of FBN1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete haplotype heterozygosity was observed in a population of 50 unrelated control individuals when the flanking markers and existing intragenic polymorphisms were used in combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate the utility of haplotype segregation analysis in the presymptomatic diagnosis and counseling of families showing atypical or equivocal manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
