<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the visual results of conservative (non- surgical) therapy, we reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> our patients with genetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo>, with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's Syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 50% had significant permanent (or potentially so) ametropic functional <z:hpo ids='HP_0000646'>amblyopia</z:hpo> (visual acuity 20/50 to 20/200) in spite of good conservative management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was especially true (100%) if the amount of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>lens dislocation</z:hpo> was such that the lens edge was approaching the center of the pupil (vision still primarily phakic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The worst <z:hpo ids='HP_0000646'>amblyopia</z:hpo> was noted when the lens was still covering the visual axis and the lens edge was 1.3 mm from the center of the pupil (range of 0.3 to 2.3 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With regard to the most serious complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> and its treatment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo>, when it occurred in our patients it was more strongly related to axial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011003'>high myopia</z:hpo> than surgery, per se </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since the axial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011003'>high myopia</z:hpo> which characteristically develops in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> is probably the result of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000646'>amblyopia</z:hpo> or the amblyopiagenic optics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo>, lentectomy may be indicated early in this condition, before the axial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011003'>high myopia</z:hpo> develops, to prevent both axial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011003'>high myopia</z:hpo> and the attendant risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> as well as functional <z:hpo ids='HP_0000646'>amblyopia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">refractive error</z:e> cannot be corrected well and the resultant ametropic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000646'>amblyopia</z:hpo> does not respond to conservative management, early surgery should be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If the lens is subluxated so that the edge of the lens approaches to within 0.3 to 2.3 mm of the center of the pupil (with best correctable vision still phakic), this is highly probable </plain></SENT>
