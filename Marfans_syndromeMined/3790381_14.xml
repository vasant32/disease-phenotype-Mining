<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ratio of left ventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume to right ventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume was calculated from contiguous transverse magnetic resonance images and was used to measure the severity of regurgitation in 18 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> and 10 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> was well demonstrated, allowing an assessment of relative chamber volumes and associated abnormalities, although valve abnormality was not well seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a weak correlation between magnetic resonance measurements of left ventricular end diastolic volume and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume ratio differed significantly in four groups with increasing angiographic severity of regurgitation, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but the group with trivial regurgitation differed significantly from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was good correlation between magnetic resonance and radionuclide measurements of left ventricular ejection fraction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume ratio, although the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume ratio was consistently overestimated by radionuclide ventriculography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correlation was less good for the right ventricular ejection fraction, which was underestimated by radionuclide ventriculography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that magnetic resonance imaging provides valuable information in patients with valvar regurgitation, and serves as a suitable standard by which to judge conventional techniques </plain></SENT>
