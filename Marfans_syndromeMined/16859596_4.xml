<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To review the prevalence, mechanisms, presentations and clinical significance of aortic involvement in rheumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical literature, available through a PUBMED search was reviewed and the relevant information was summarized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, selected articles related to aortic involvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> were included in this review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rheumatic disorders may be categorized by their propensity to involve the aorta: conditions with a prevalence of 10% and more (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu</z:e>'s <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo>, temporal <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo>, long-standing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ankylosing spondylitis</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cogan's syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032453" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">relapsing polychondritis</z:e>), disorders with uncommon but well documented aortic involvement and rheumatic conditions with rare case reports of such involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical presentation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> is dependent on the part of aorta involved and may manifest by aortic pain and/or other symptoms caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo>, narrowing or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The histopathology of inflammatory <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp> is characterized by lymphoplasmacytic infiltration with or without giant cells or granulomas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, non-inflammatory aortic damage in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> may include Marfan-like cystic disintegration of the aortic media as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004943'>accelerated atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Awareness of rheumatic conditions with a high potential for clinically significant aortic involvement may promote referral of such patients for aortic imaging and sometimes surgery before fatal complications intervene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis of aortic involvement can be advanced by informed consideration of such a complication in a rheumatic patient </plain></SENT>
