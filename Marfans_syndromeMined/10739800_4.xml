<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the results of clinical and linkage investigations of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADPKD</z:e> family in whom several affected subjects also had aortic vascular complications as well as features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Detailed clinical assessment and linkage analysis were performed with polymorphic microsatellite markers closely linked to the PKD1 and FBN1 loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival data were compared with 10 geographically matched PKD1 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although several subjects had features of both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADPKD</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, detailed clinical examination of the extended family indicated that the two conditions had converged within the kindred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADPKD</z:e>, linkage was established to the PKD1 locus (lod score, 6.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among those with features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, linkage was confirmed to the FBN1 locus (lod score, 1.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five of six subjects with both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADPKD</z:e> and the high-risk FBN1 haplotype had associated vascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, among the remaining nine individuals with PKD1 alone, seven had aortic assessments, and none were found to have aortic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our experience suggests that when prominent features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disease</z:e> or vascular complications are found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADPKD</z:e> patients, alternative additional diagnoses should be considered, including the possibility of a coinherited FBN1 mutation responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> or, alternatively, an associated milder FBN1 phenotype in the absence of sufficient other clinical features to allow <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> to be diagnosed </plain></SENT>
