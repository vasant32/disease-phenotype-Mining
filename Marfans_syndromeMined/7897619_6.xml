<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have found abnormal fibrillin microfibrils isolated from tissues and cell cultures from two cousins with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> whose major clinical abnormality is bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo>, but who also have skeletal involvement but no cardiovascular defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural analysis of ciliary zonules showed the presence of abundant loose microfibril bundles which in many places appeared disorganised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microfibrils isolated from ciliary zonules and vitreous were highly fragmented when examined by rotary shadowing electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Investigation of microfibrils elaborated by patient dermal fibroblasts showed remarkable variations in periodicity and packing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The synthesis and secretion of fibrillin by these cells was confirmed electrophoretically with the identification of metabolically labelled immunoprecipitated fibrillin (M(r) 300,000) in medium and cell layer compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data show that fibrillin expression is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> but that assembled microfibrils are manifestly abnormal both morphologically and functionally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of microfibrils with variable periodicities and susceptibility to fragmentation suggests that structural <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> is probably the primary cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>lens dislocation</z:hpo> in these patients </plain></SENT>
