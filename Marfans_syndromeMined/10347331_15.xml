<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Aortic root stiffness index and distensibility were calculated according to the formulas of Stefanadis and Hirai, respectively, with 2-dimensional guided M-mode echocardiogram before and after an average of 26 months of atenolol administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-three asymptomatic patients were studied (11 men and 12 women, aged 31 +/- 14.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The follow-up was 4 +/- 2.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dose of atenolol was individualized (mean 43.5 +/- 21.6 mg/d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Heart rate decreased from 79 +/- 9 beats/min to 64 +/- 9 beats/min (P = </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>01), and systolic blood pressure decreased from 124 +/- 13 mm Hg to 114 +/- 2 mm Hg (P =.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Distensibility increased from 1.85 +/- 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>70 x 10(-6) cm2/dynes-1 to 2.21 +/- 0.76 x 10-6 cm2/dynes-1 (P =.02), and the stiffness index decreased from 9.68 +/- 3.78 to 8.85 +/- 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>15 ( P =.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two groups of responses to treatment were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Compared with baseline values 15 (65%) patients who responded to treatment had increased distensibility and decreased stiffness index of the aortic root (P =.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (35%) who did not respond to treatment had no significant change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Body weight &gt;91 kg and baseline end-diastolic aortic root diameter &gt;40 mm were significantly associated with no response (P =.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Two patients in the nonresponding group had echocardiographic progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There was a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> response in the aortic root elastic properties after long-term treatment with atenolol in asymptomatic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Stiffness index and distensibility are more likely to respond when the baseline end-diastolic aortic root diameter is &lt;40 mm </plain></SENT>
