<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Aortic complications determine the life expectancy of most patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To find out whether there is heterogenous aortic involvement among patients and, if there is, to characterize aortic patterns and response to long-term beta-blocker therapy, we investigated aortic elastic properties before and during beta-blocker treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 46 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (age, 17.4 +/- 11.1 years) and 46 healthy control subjects, ascending and descending aortic elastic parameters were determined noninvasively before and after 39 +/- 16 months of beta-blocker treatment with atenolol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Aortic diameters and distensibility distinguished Marfan patients and controls with a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 87% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cluster analysis revealed 4 patterns of aortic phenotypic expression: (1) reduced ascending aortic elasticity (46% of patients), (2) diminished ascending and descending aortic elasticity (17%), (3) minimal alterations of ascending and descending aortic elasticity (20%), and (4) reduced descending aortic elasticity (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, aortic elastic properties improved in 21 (70%) of 30 patients and deteriorated in 9 (30%) irrespective of beta-blocker dosage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Improvement was observed in 100% of patients (n = 7; age, 5.3 +/- 4.2 years) with end-diastolic aortic root diameters between 20 and 30 mm and in 61% of patients (14/23; age, 20.5 +/- 10.0 years) with root diameters between 30 and 52 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aortic elastic parameters distinguish between patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and healthy controls and show the pattern of regional aortic involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Improvement or deterioration during follow-up can influence therapeutic decisions to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Young age, small root diameter, and high distensibility are favorable prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
