<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although the mainstay of managing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> descending thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (ADTAD) remains medical, certain patients will require emergency surgery for complications of rupture or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates factors that affect outcome and determines which patients previously treated surgically would have been eligible for endovascular repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A single-institution retrospective study was conducted of patients who presented with clinical signs of ADTAD that was confirmed by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computed tomography (CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and medically managed to maintain systolic blood pressure&lt;120 mm Hg and heart rate&lt;70 beats/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two treatment groups were identified: group 1 received medical treatment only; group 2 received medical treatment plus emergency surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient demographic and clinical data were correlated with 30-day group mortality and morbidity and need for emergency surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The MRA and CT scan images of group 2 were retrospectively reviewed to determine if currently available endovascular treatment could have been done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Fisher exact test was used to compare between the groups, and P&lt;.05 was considered significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 1991 and 2005, 83 patients (55 men) were treated for ADTAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 67 years (range, 38 to 85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sixty-eight patients (82%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, three (3.6%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and 51 (62%) were smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five (32%) of the patients were receiving beta-blocker therapy before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of their symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>Back pain</z:hpo> was the most common initial symptom (72.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Emergency surgery was required in 19 patients (23%): 12 for rupture or impending rupture, four for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920157" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mesenteric ischemia</z:e>, and three for lower extremity <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The need for emergency surgery was significantly higher in smokers (P=.03), in patients&gt;70 years old (P=.035), and in patients who were not receiving beta-blocker therapy before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms (P=.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The combined overall morbidity rate was 33%, and the mortality rate was 9.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Morbidity in group 2 was 64% and significantly higher than the 23% in group 1 (P=.00227) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate was also higher in group 2 at 31.5% compared with group 1 at 1.6% (P=.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Factors affecting the overall mortality included age&gt;70 years (P=.057), previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> repair (P=.018), tobacco use (P=.039), and the presence of leg pain at initial presentation (P=.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>As determined from the review of radiologic data, 11 of 13 patients with scans available for review in group 2 could have been treated with currently available endovascular grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intensive medical therapies are effective in preventing early mortality associated with ADTAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Predictably, the need for emergency surgery carries a high morbidity and mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Most patients in this series requiring emergency surgery could have been candidates for endovascular therapy had it been available </plain></SENT>
