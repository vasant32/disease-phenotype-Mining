<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There have been major advances in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic valve disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> is common and predicts an increased risk of adverse aortic events, these patients merit aortic surveillance and consideration for ascending aortic replacement when its diameter exceeds 4.0 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serial quantitative echocardiographic analysis, as compared with traditional clinical markers, can result in better timing of surgical intervention for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, echocardiographic analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> can classify the mechanism based on cusp mobility to guide aortic valve repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In aortic root replacement, aortic valve preservation with reimplantation is a mainstream surgical option in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> to offer freedom from valve-related anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prosthetic aortic root replacement has further alternatives with the introduction of the aortic neosinus design and acceptable clinical outcomes with the porcine xenograft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because aortic valve prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) may adversely affect patient outcome, its perioperative prevention is important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, significant functional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> often resolves after aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic assessment of the aortic valve must include valve area because the transaortic pressure gradient may be low in severe stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aortic valve replacement with partial sternotomy is safe and offers a reasonable less invasive alternative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transcatheter aortic valve replacement, whether transfemoral or transapical, has revolutionized aortic valve replacement; it remains a major theme in the specialty for 2009 and beyond </plain></SENT>
