<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They occurred in a consecutive series of 1,800 planned intracapsulars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Included in the complete series were 16 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>dislocated lenses</z:hpo> in 3 groups: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo> and congenital types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001373'>dislocations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of these were removed since the patient's vision was adequate in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients are still under observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one case, we used the Hagler-Calhoun double pronged needle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We think this procedure is entirely too traumatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 21 cases, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>dislocated lenses</z:hpo> were removed intracapsularly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In one instance, the lens nucleus had been dislocated in an earlier operation, and there was advanced secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lens was removed with cryosurgery, resulting in a useful eye with no pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cryoextraction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>dislocated lenses</z:hpo> is the least traumatic surgical approach and is the method of choice </plain></SENT>
