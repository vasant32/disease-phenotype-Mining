<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-four patients (19 males, 25 females; mean age 8.9+/-3.9 years, median 7.0 years, range: 1.3 to 15 years) underwent heart valve replacement with mechanical prostheses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 25 had left atrioventricular valve replacement (LavVR) (18 mitral, six tricuspid in corrected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001669'>transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>), one common in a <z:mp ids='MP_0010432'>univentricular heart</z:mp>), 13 had aortic valve replacement (AVR) and six had tricuspid valve replacement (TVR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The etiology of the valvular disease was congenital in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and complicated by infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> in seven (16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients had undergone previous procedures and 16 required simultaneous repair of associated lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean size of the implanted prosthesis was 26 mm (range: 19-29 mm) for LavVR, 29.7 mm (range: 23-33 mm) for TVR, and 21.9 mm (range: 19-25 mm) for AVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients received oral anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean follow up was 6.8+/-3.5 years (total 290 patient-years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no early mortality, but three patients (7%) died later; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred in patients with LavVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden deaths</z:hpo>, both in patients with complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (before the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> era), and one valve-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from thrombotic occlusion of a mitral prosthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five patients were reoperated on; three for patient-prosthesis mismatch, one for periprosthetic leak, and one for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic obstruction occurred in three patients; two in the tricuspid position were treated successfully with thrombolysis, but one in the left atrioventricular position proved fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After seven years, the survival rate was 93.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical heart valve replacement in children aged over one year with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> can be performed with satisfactory early and late results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Mechanical valves of &gt;23 mm diameter in the atrioventricular position in the systemic ventricle, and &gt;21 mm in the aortic orifice, can offer excellent long-lasting hemodynamic performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, mechanical valves in the tricuspid position are prone to develop thrombotic occlusion </plain></SENT>
