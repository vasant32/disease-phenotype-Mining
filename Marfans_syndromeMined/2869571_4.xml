<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, biosynthesis of isodesmosine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37628">desmosine</z:chebi>, the cross-linking amino acids of elastin, was studied by metabolic labelling with [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]lysine and subsequent amino acid chromatography of protein hydrolysates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="32568">Lysyl</z:chebi> oxidase activity in culture media of skin fibroblasts and aortic smooth muscle cells increased with the growth of the cell population and was at the highest level in cultures of high cell density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="32568">Lysyl</z:chebi> oxidase activity in the aortic cell cultures was about three times that of skin fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aortic smooth muscle cells synthesized at least 100 times more <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37628">desmosines</z:chebi> than skin or adventitial fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32568">lysyl</z:chebi> oxidase activity and synthesis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37628">desmosines</z:chebi> between aortic smooth muscle cells or skin fibroblasts from patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> or other annulo-aortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005111'>dilatation of the ascending aorta</z:hpo>) and the corresponding controls </plain></SENT>
