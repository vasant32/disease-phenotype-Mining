<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Through a number of investigational approaches, the gene encoding for fibrillin, the FBN1 gene on chromosome 15, has been identified as the defective gene causing the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin is the large <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> with a repetitive domain structure and is a major protein component of microfibrils, a fibrillar system closely associated with elastin in connective tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutational analysis of defects in the FBN1 gene in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> has revealed that most mutations are private or unique in an affected individual or family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of fibrillin protein or gene defects in individuals with related phenotypes has revealed that a perinatal lethal syndrome, termed neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, is due to FBN1 gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, fibroblast cell strains from a subset of patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> have fibrillin protein defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Last, fibroblasts from calves affected with bovine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> display defects in the fibrillin protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies have wide-ranging implications in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and related disorders </plain></SENT>
