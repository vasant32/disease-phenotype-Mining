<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To examine the cornea of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in comparison with a control group by using the in vivo confocal microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four eyes of 12 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> had their corneas examined using the in vivo confocal microscope Heidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT) II/Rostock Cornea Module </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The control group included 24 eyes of 12 subjects who had their corneas examined by the same in vivo confocal microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Epithelium and neural plexus examination did not show any difference between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Examination of the stroma showed no significant differences concerning the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and density of keratocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The extracellular matrix of 16 of the 24 eyes of the Marfan group was clearly visible and showed thin highly reflective interconnected lines between keratocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the healthy eye group, reflective lines were observed in only 5 of the 24 eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The endothelium of 14 corneas of the Marfan group showed brightly reflective particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In no cornea of the control group were such particles observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Highly reflective extracellular matrix of the stroma and brightly reflective particles among the endothelial cells were the 2 main corneal findings observed by using in vivo corneal confocal microscopy in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> compared with a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies need to be made to confirm these findings and eventually find new criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> from the examination of in vivo corneal confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
