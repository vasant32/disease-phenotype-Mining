<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: No relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and pigmentary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> has previously been described in the ophthalmic literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe the case of a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> who had bilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_751'>pigment dispersion</z:mpath> syndrome and asymmetrical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 34-year-old man with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> developed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_751'>pigment dispersion</z:mpath> bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the right eye, elevated intra-ocular pressure was associated with marked glaucomatous excavation of the right disc and corresponding visual field loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A localised zonular dehiscence was present at the 6 o'clock position in the right eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ultrasound biomicroscopy showed marked iris concavity in the right eye, increased iridolenticular contact and superior subluxation of the right lens, resulting in increased dispersion of pigment unilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This explains the asymmetric pattern of the glaucomatous damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Asymmetrical progression of pigmentary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> is uncommon and should prompt a search for some other mechanical factor, which might increase the iridozonular contact on one side or reduce it on the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association between the two syndromes in this patient was most likely mechanical due to reduced fibrillin expression throughout the eye and particularly in the iris and the lens zonules, resulting in loss of iris tensile strength and marked iris concavity as well as zonular <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001132'>lens subluxation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
