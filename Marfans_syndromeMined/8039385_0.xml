<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The content of hydroxypyridinium crosslinks in biopsy specimens of human rib cartilage, rib bone, hip joint capsule, and urine was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues revealed the presence of LP (alongside with HP) in embryonal rib cartilage and of HP+LP in the hip joint capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The urinary content of excreted HP in children under the age of two years exceeded the HP content in urine samples from children in the 2-12 year age group (t = 2.58, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pathological material was obtained, for the most part, from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>funnel chest</z:hpo> (FC), both isolated and combined with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos</z:e> (EDS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities in tissue and urinary hydroxypyridinium crosslinks were observed in patients with clinical features of EDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LP was found in the rib cartilage of 4 out of 6 patients with FC associated with EDS; no signs of this pathology were detected in individuals with isolated FC </plain></SENT>
