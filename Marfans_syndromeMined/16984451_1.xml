<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Collagen is an unusual protein because it requires multiple processing steps both within and outside the cell beginning with transcription and refinement of its <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi>, translation of the mature <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, extensive post-translational modifications, and further alterations in the extracellular compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If errors are made at any one of the multiple steps in this complex pathway, a defective molecule will be formed that could result in connective tissue abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similarly, alterations in other components of the extracellular matrix can also result in clinical pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some of these clinical phenotypes have been classified as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029434" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteogenesis imperfecta</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">epidermolysis bullosa</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This article reviews these various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e>, describes the underlying biochemical defects, and describes their impact on tissue repair </plain></SENT>
