<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess the results of a 10-year experience with a minimally invasive operation that requires neither cartilage incision nor resection for correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1987 to 1996, 148 patients were evaluated for chest wall deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty of 127 patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> were selected for surgical correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight older patients underwent the Ravitch procedure, and 42 patients under age 15 were treated by the minimally invasive technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A convex steel bar is inserted under the sternum through small bilateral thoracic incisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The steel bar is inserted with the convexity facing posteriorly, and when it is in position, the bar is turned over, thereby correcting the deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 2 years, when permanent remolding has occurred, the bar is removed in an outpatient procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 42 patients who had the minimally invasive procedure, 30 have undergone bar removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Initial excellent results were maintained in 22, good results in four, fair in two, and poor in two, with mean follow-up since surgery of 4.6 years (range, 1 to 9.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up since bar removal is 2.8 years (range, 6 months to 7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Average blood loss was 15 mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Average length of hospital stay was 4.3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients returned to full activity after 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Complications were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo> in four patients, requiring thoracostomy in one patient; superficial wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in one patient; and displacement of the steel bar requiring revision in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The fair and poor results occurred early in the series because (1) the bar was too soft (three patients), (2) the sternum was too soft in one of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, and (3) in one patient with complex thoracic anomalies, the bar was removed too soon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This minimally invasive technique, which requires neither cartilage incision nor resection, is effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Since increasing the strength of the steel bar and inserting two bars where necessary, we have had excellent long-term results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The upper limits of age for this procedure require further evaluation </plain></SENT>
