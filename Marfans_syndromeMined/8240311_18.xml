<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Likewise, nobody would have predicted that fibrillin represents a small family of proteins that are associated with several phenotypically overlapping disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The fibrillins are integral constituents of the non-collagenous microfibrils, with an average diameter of 10 nm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These aggregates are distributed in the extracellular matrix of virtually every tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microfibrillar bundles provide the external coating to elastin in elastic fibers, and serve an anchoring function in non-elastic tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At higher resolution, individual microfibrils have a "beads-on-a-string" appearance resulting from the head-to-tail polymerization of multiple fibrillin aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Structurally, fibrillin contains a series of repeated sequences homologous to the epidermal growth factor calcium-binding motif </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Characterization of fibrillin mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> patients, together with the elucidation of the structure of the fibrillin proteins, have provided new insights, and raised new questions, about the function of the 10 nm microfibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For example, it is possible that the fibrillins, in addition to serving a structural function, might also be involved in regulating cellular activities and morphogenetic programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is fitting that the long search for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> gene has brought a novel group of proteins to the forefront of extracellular matrix biology </plain></SENT>
