<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study determines the effect of surgical treatment of cardiovascular manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in 72 patients by 114 operations, during 34-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This therapy resulted in aortic root repair, aortic arch replacement, or both in 78, mitral valve repair in 9, descending thoracic aortic replacement in 14, thoracoabdominal aortic replacement in 10, and abdominal aortic replacement in 6, including total aortic replacement in 4 and nearly total aortic replacement in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were present in the the ascending aorta in 37, the aortic arch in 2, the thoracoabdominal aorta in 2, and the abdominal aorta in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic dissection</z:hpo> occurred in 40 (55.6%), including type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in 29 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aortic root repair included separate valve-graft in 8, Bentall composite valve-graft in 25, composite valve-graft with button technique in 26, composite valve-graft with interposition graft technique in 10, and valve sparing procedure in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall early (30-day) mortality was 7.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The early survival was 75% in separate valve-graft procedure and 99.2% in composite valve-graft procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Late coronary dehiscence did not occur in the patients with Bentall technique in which the reattachments of coronary ostia were performed in 2 layers, but occurred in 50% of patients with the coronary anastomoses in 1 layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>Aortic valve regurgitation</z:hpo> relapsed in 2 of the 5 patients with valve sparing procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Event free rate for the patients with composite valve-graft using button technique was 81.1% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were 14 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>; dissection or rupture of the residual aorta, composite graft <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> were the principle causes of late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, Marfan patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> can undergo surgical treatment with a low operative risk and low morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although late <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> remains a serious problem, we believe that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is a contraindication for valve sparing procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Because of the potential for late dissection or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in other areas of the aorta, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> should have serial computed tomographic scans indefinitely </plain></SENT>
