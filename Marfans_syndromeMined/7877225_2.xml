<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During this 5-year period, 79 operations were performed including composite valve graft replacement (n = 28) and graft replacement of the thoracoabdominal aorta (n = 29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven additional operations had been performed before referral, for a total of 136 aortic operations in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients (60.9%) required multiple operations; 16 patients (23.2%) underwent three or more procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Follow-up was complete on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 30-day and long-term survival rates were 98.7% and 96.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Distal aortic replacement resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002385'>paraparesis</z:hpo> in only one (2.6%) of 38 patients; no patient had development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patient had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after the use of profound hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Aortic surgery prolongs survival in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and currently has low associated morbidity and mortality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment often requires multiple staged operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The variety and multiplicity of aortic manifestations in these patients demonstrate the necessity for lifelong cardiovascular surveillance to detect new or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
