<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Fifty consecutive patients (25 women) attending the Adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>Congenital Heart Disease</z:hpo> Clinic, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, filled out a questionnaire that tested knowledge about their heart defect and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients ranged in age from 18 to 60 years (mean 25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most frequent cardiovascular anomalies were obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract (13), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001680'>coarctation of the aorta</z:hpo> (10), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> (six), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001669'>transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo> (five) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (four) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients had been seen on average by three cardiologists (range one to six) and had made an average of seven clinic visits (range one to 22) since the age of 17 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had been followed at other clinics in the past </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN RESULTS: Fifty-four per cent of patients knew their diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-four per cent could explain the defect in lay language, and another 48% made an attempt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When given a heart diagram, 26% marked their defect correctly and 28% made an attempt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Terms '<z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>' and 'antibiotic prophylaxis' were known to 16% and 22% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight per cent could name at least one situation that carries a risk of '<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in the heart' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> have poor knowledge of their heart defects and the importance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> and antibiotic prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although time consuming, patient education should be a part of every clinic visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Repetitive and structured patient education may improve patients' knowledge and, hence, participation in their health care </plain></SENT>
