<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The author has investigated grossly and microscopically 12 cases (5 males and 7 females) of dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in individuals under 40 years of age, autopsied during the last 6 years at the Tokyo-to Medical Examiner Office </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They composed of 6 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, 3 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and one case each of pregnancy, <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp> syndrome, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000037'>male pseudohermaphroditism</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 6 cases other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> were also thought to belong to the Marfan group from the gross and microscopic examinations of the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As to the cases of dissecting <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> of the aorta, Erdheim's idiopathic cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was as a rule authentical up to date, but the author has never observed the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> which were said to be formed due to accumulation of metachromatic ground substance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, the medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> occurred always in the weakened area in where the elastic fibers were disrupted and disappeared accompanying with the diminution of metachromatic substance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The author assumed that the diminution of metachromatic substance might be the most important etiologic factor of dissecting <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> of the media and the extension of dissection might occur along such weakened foci of the media </plain></SENT>
