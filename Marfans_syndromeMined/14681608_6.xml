<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the morbidity and mortality of surgery for thoracoabdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> (TAAA) in patients with prior aortic surgery are increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The results for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing operation for TAAA at a single institution were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over a 10-year interval, 279 patients (136 women and 143 men) underwent aortic replacement for TAAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean patient age was 68 years (range, 34-90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The extent of aortic replacement was relatively evenly distributed: type I (91), type II (54), type III (78), or type IV (56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these 279 patients, 76 (27%) had undergone prior aortic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prior infrarenal AAA was the most common prior procedure (56, 20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reoperation for prior failed TAAA repair was performed in 20 (7%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> was highly associated with the need for remedial TAAA procedures (P &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall 30-day mortality was 11.4% (32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mortality was independent of prior aortic surgery (P =.98), prior AAA (P =.84), prior TAAA (P =.61), and gender (P =.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Postoperative complications were seen in 67 (24%) patients and were more likely in patients who had undergone prior AAA surgery (P =.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>TAAA repair in patients with recurrent TAAA was not associated with higher morbidity (P =.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>Paraplegia</z:hpo> (10) occurred in type I (3), type II (2), and type III (5) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> but not in type IV (0), and its development was associated with higher mortality (P =.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Prior aortic surgery was not found to be predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> (P =.90), although 30% of patients who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> had a history of prior AAA repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aortic reoperation for TAAA is required in a significant number of patients, particularly those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Therefore, ongoing surveillance of the residual aorta is mandatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Postoperative complications are more likely to occur in patients after prior infrarenal aortic replacement, but mortality is not significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Special technical considerations exist for remedial procedures after failed TAAA repair to provide protection for the spinal cord, kidneys, and viscera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Patients with failed TAAA procedures or progression of aneurysmal extent should be offered reoperation when indicated </plain></SENT>
