<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In part, these changes are caused by a loss of elasticity in the elastic fibers of the extracellular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These fibers are composed of the protein elastin associated with microfibrils of 8 to 12 nm in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microfibrils contain fibrillins as major constituents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations in fibrillin genes are considered as primary causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorder</z:e> with pathological manifestations in the cardiovascular and skeletal systems, in addition to dysfunctions in the eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin is also the major protein of the ciliary zonule fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During ageing, these fibers become more fragile, and concomitantly, an increased risk for ocular pathologies is observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have investigated structural modifications in fibrillin-rich microfibrils during ageing of human ciliary zonule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Observations using light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy after rotary shadowing allowed us to describe the organization of the zonule fibers and their insertion into the ciliary body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results emphasize qualitative differences between young and old zonules, which are likely due to modifications in the structure of microfibrils </plain></SENT>
