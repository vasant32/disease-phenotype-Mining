<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we report our experience with aortic root replacement using a composite graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between October 1978 and May 2001, 274 patients (79.6% male and 20.4% female) with a mean age of 53.5 years underwent composite graft replacement of the aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred sixty-one patients (70.8%) had annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> and 46 (16.8%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The classic Bentall technique was used in 94 patients (34.3%), the "button technique" in 172 patients (62.8%), and the Cabrol technique in 8 patients (2.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The early mortality rate was 6.9% (19 of 274 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardiopulmonary bypass time longer than 180 minutes and associated coronary artery bypass grafting were found to be independent risk factors of early mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival rate was 77.7% at 5 years and 63% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The independent risk factors for late mortality were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo>, and postoperative dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The actuarial freedom from reoperation on the remaining aorta was higher among patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (94.6% versus 79.6% at 10 years, p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Composite valve graft replacement can be performed with low hospital mortality and morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The button technique offers some advantages and should be used whenever possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> root replacement is usually not necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Marfan patients should be treated with early root replacement before dissection occurs </plain></SENT>
