<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five specialists (a genetics specialist, a pediatrician or a rheumatologist, an ophthalmologist, and a psychologist) saw <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients successively in the same clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A synthesis of the clinical files was prepared for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since the first consultation on 1 January 1995 and the study end on 30 June 1997, 494 patients (67% adults) participated in primary consultations, 143 were seen at follow-up consultations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's disease</z:e> was affirmed in 41% of the patients, disaffirmed in 48% and uncertain in 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the Marfan's patients, 75% were seen again within the framework of a multidisciplinary follow-up consultations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Annual work-up included cardiology (echocardiography with measurement of the proximal aorta diameter in search for indication for beta-blocker therapy or preventive valve replacement), ophthalmology (lens, retina) and rheumatology examinations (skeletal involvement) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis and rigorous follow-up can help prevent ocular and cardiac complications in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The multidisciplinary approach provides more precise data for diagnosis and possible phenotype-genotype correlations </plain></SENT>
