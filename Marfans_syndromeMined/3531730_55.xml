<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Between September, 1974, and December, 1985, 127 patients had replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic valve with a composite graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> was the most common indication for operation (69 patients), followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (51 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients (19%) had the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hospital mortality was 4.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Emergent operation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection was the only independent predictor of hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reoperation for postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was required in 15 patients (11.8%) and for prosthesis-related complications (pseudoaneurysm, prosthetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, technical problems, and valve <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>) in 16 patients (12.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since we adopted a technique of preclotting the prosthesis with whole blood or albumin plus autoclaving and abandoned the inclusion technique, the reoperation rate has declined substantially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 5 years, the actuarial freedom from reoperation for any reason on the ascending aorta or aortic valve for the 24 patients in whom this modification was used was 90% and for the remaining 103 patients, 73% (p = 0.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No reoperations for pseudoaneurysms or technical problems were required in these 24 patients, whereas 10 reoperations for these complications were necessary in the other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of follow-up was 54 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival rate at 7 years for the entire group was 65%; for the patients with annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath>, 70%; for those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, 61%; for the patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, 57% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Actuarial freedom from operation on the remainder of the aorta at 7 years was 89%, but it was 78% for the subgroup with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The satisfactory results with extended follow-up support the continued use of the composite graft technique as the preferred method of treatment for patients with annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> or recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the sinuses of Valsalva and for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> who require aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
