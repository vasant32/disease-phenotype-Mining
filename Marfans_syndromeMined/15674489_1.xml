<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We reviewed the outcome of aortic operations in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> to evaluate the immediate and long-term results of surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 1985 and June 2002, 22 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> underwent surgical treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic diseases</z:e> at our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had Stanford type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and ten patients had aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed aortic root replacement in 21 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequent aortic operations were done in 11 patients, 6 of whom required a third operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients underwent repeat surgery of the previously operated aortic segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A collective a total of 42 aortic operations were performed in the 22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven patients underwent total aortic replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The in-hospital mortality rate was 4.5%, and there were three late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>: two caused by rupture of the dissected aorta, 17 months and 24 months after the last surgical intervention, respectively, and one caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> 27 months after a total aortic replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall actuarial survival was 90.2% at 5 years and 74.4% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> can be accomplished with low mortality; however, new aortic lesions should be promptly explored, and appropriately timed surgical treatment can substantially improve the prognosis of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
