<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four of these patients were operated twice, making a total of 74 operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The operations were grouped according to the Stanford classification in Type A-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (53%), type A-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (11%), type B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (26%) and type B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven patients were males (81%) and 90% of the operations were performed as emergencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven percent of the patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan Syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The peroperative mortality was 23% and the perioperative mortality was 39% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 10 year survival including the perioperative mortality was 39% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of operative complications lasting for more than one month was 12% and some of these complications were caused rather by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> rather than the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further improvement depends on the referral of these patients to cardio-thoracic surgical units on near suspicion of the condition for the earliest possible treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients must be followed lifelong for recurrences in progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AD </plain></SENT>
