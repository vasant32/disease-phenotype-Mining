<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective radiological study of 58 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and related the findings in the thoracolumbar spine to the pelvic parameters, including pelvic version (tilt), pelvic incidence and sacral slope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results showed marked abnormalities in the pelvic values compared with those found in the unaffected population, with increased retroversion of the pelvis in particular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition we found a close correlation between the different patterns of pelvic parameters and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results supplement the well-established Sponseller classification, as well as stressing the importance of considering the orientation of the pelvis when planning surgery </plain></SENT>
