<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This has been demonstrated experimentally by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> subcutaneous infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi>, which consistently leads to development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> (AAAs) in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">Angiotensin II</z:chebi>-induced AAAs have highly heterogenous cellular and extracellular matrix characteristics throughout the aorta that change markedly with infusion duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mechanistic basis for the reproducible location of AAA development has not been elucidated, but many insights have been provided, especially regarding receptor and inflammatory mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A recent clinical study provided limited evidence for extrapolating these results to mechanisms of human AAAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Experimental evidence has also demonstrated that antagonism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> type 1 (AT1) receptors prevents <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> in a murine model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A clinical study is currently ongoing to demonstrate the efficacy of AT1 receptor antagonism in humans </plain></SENT>
