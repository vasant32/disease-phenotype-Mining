<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE:: To present the radiologic and surgical characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> treatment in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:: The treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> has been reported to pose unique challenges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the information on surgical outcomes is sparse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In clinical practice, surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> is reported to confer higher perioperative risks and instrumentation-related complications compared with adolescent idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> because of atypical and rigid curve patterns and the underlying desmogenic disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: Database research identified 26 MFS patients treated surgically during 7 years at a single spine center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients presented with previous failed surgeries and were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The medical records, charts, and radiographs of 23 patients were analyzed focusing on curve characteristics, surgical outcomes including complications, and curve correction using modern third-generation hybrid or pedicle screw systems, and the behavior of junctional segments and compensatory curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: The sample included 18 female and 5 male patients with an average age of 18.2±9.2 years (13-52 y) at index surgery and 21.2±9.2 years (14-53 y) at follow-up, averaging 35.8±23.5 months (6-95 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>According to the Lenke classification, 30% presented as type 1, 9% as type 2, 22% as type 3, 9% as type 4, 17% as type 5, and 13% of patients as type 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seventy-four percent of patients had a type C lumbar modifier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In total, 48% of patients underwent a posterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>spinal fusion</z:hpo> (PSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thirty percent had instrumented anterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>spinal fusion</z:hpo> (AISF), whereas 22% had a combined anterior release and staged PSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ninety-one percent of patients achieved solid fusion; there was 1 asymptomatic nonunion and 1 recalcitrant nonunion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Add-on phenomena were identified in 13% of patients (n=3) treated with AISF, indicating staged PSF once </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In total, complications were encountered in 30% of patients, indicating redo surgery in 17% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The cause for revision included nonunion (2x), liquor leakage (1x), and wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> at the iliac crest (1x) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>We judged the outcome as excellent/good if the patient had no major redo surgery and was very satisfied/satisfied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Overall, excellent/good outcome was noted in 78% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Blood loss averaged 659 mL in AISF and 1748 mL in PSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The surgical time was 193 minutes in AISF and 229 minutes in PSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Preoperative, postoperative, and follow-up Cobb T4-T12 was 13, 13, and 16 degrees, respectively; the mean thoracic curves measured 66 (23-106), 36 (0-58), and 38 degrees (0-58), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Lumbar curves measured 63 (23-110), 27 (0-80), and 24 degrees (0-68), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Coronal plumb line measured 2.2, 2.6, and 1.2 cm, respectively, indicating good trunk balance in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The flexibility rates of thoracic curves and lumbar curves were 38% and 47%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Thoracic curve correction in PSF and combined anterior release/PSF was 44%, and in AISF, it reached 57% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: The current study highlights the potential pitfalls in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> surgery for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Surgery was performed using third-generation pedicle screw-based and hook-based systems for PSF and second-generation and third-generation implants for AISF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>We illustrated that the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, taking into account the individual challenges of the underlying desmogenic disorder, can be performed with a moderately increased risk for surgical complications compared with adolescent idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
