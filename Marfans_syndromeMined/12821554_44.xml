<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Familial thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and dissections (TAAD) occur as part of known syndromes such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> but can also be inherited in families in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> manner as an isolated condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have mapped genes causing nonsyndromic familial TAAD to 5q13-15 (TAAD1) and 11q23.2-q24 (FAA1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> for the condition was evident by the presence of TAAD in some families not linked to these known loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A 4-generation family with dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> of TAAD was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Affected status was determined by <z:hpo ids='HP_0005111'>dilation of the ascending aorta</z:hpo>, surgical repair of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> or dissection, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as the result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the family members evaluated met the diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After exclusion of known loci for familial TAAD, a genome-wide scan was carried out to map the defective gene causing the disease in the family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A locus was mapped to a 25-cM region on 3p24-25 with a maximum multipoint logarithm of the odds score of 4.28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A third locus for nonsyndromic TAAD was mapped to 3p24-25 and termed the TAAD2 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This locus overlaps a previously mapped second locus for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, termed the MFS2 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future characterization of the TAAD2 gene will determine if TAAD2 is allelic to MFS2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, identification of the TAAD2 gene will improve the presymptomatic diagnosis of individuals with this life-threatening <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0567439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic syndrome</z:e> and provide information concerning the pathogenesis of the disease </plain></SENT>
