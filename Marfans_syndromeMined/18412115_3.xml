<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disorder is caused by mutations in fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The majority of these are family-specific point mutations, with a small number being predicted to cause exon-skipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To date, there have only been five reports of in-frame exon deletions in FBN1, with the largest of these spanning three exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mosaicism is rarely recorded and has only been reported in the unaffected, or mildly affected, parents of probands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we report on the clinical histories of two children with exon deletions in FBN1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both have severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> with significant signs in infancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient has a deletion of exon 33, which has not previously been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The other has the largest reported deletion, which spans 37 exons, and also represents the first reported case of mosaicism in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
