<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both the Harrington and Luque rodding systems were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 1128 wire loops were passed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This worked well for neuromuscular scolioses, but for idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> there was a disturbing loss of correction in many cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fusion to the sacrum was best accomplished with the "Galveston" technique, other methods having a high rate of pseudarthrosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The main benefits appeared to be the ability to stabilize neuromuscular patients without the use of external immbolization, and the correction of thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003307'>lordosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
