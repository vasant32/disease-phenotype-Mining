<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Endovascular stent-graft placement is replacing traditional surgery in type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Usually stent-graft implantation is performed under fluoroscopic and angiographic guidance, but this relatively new procedure is still burdened with some complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the value of a developed algorithm based on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for guiding stent-graft implantation in type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-two patients with type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> in 28 patients with aneurysmal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the false lumen, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> complicated in 14 patients) underwent endovascular stent-graft reconstruction of the descending thoracic aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TEE was always performed after angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TEE-induced variations of the procedure, based on the algorithm, were compared with initial angiography-based decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TEE was decisive for guidewire repositioning (not possible with fluoroscopy) from the false to the true lumen in 3 patients and for correct guidewire entrance in an elephant trunk prosthesis in another patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After stent-graft implantation color Doppler TEE enabled detection of proximal peri-stent leaks in 13 patients, whereas only 6 (46%) of the 13 leaks were detectable at angiography (P = .008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most leaks were subsequently eliminated with balloon dilation or further stent grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pulsed Doppler TEE was also useful for differentiating true leaks (13 patients) from Dacron porosity (7 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A pulsed-Doppler velocity cutoff value of 50 cm/s enabled differentiation of Dacron porosity (characterized by slow blood flow) from true peri-stent leak (fast flow) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After stent-graft implantation TEE demonstrated new intimal tears in the thoracic aorta in 7 patients, whereas only 2 of the 7 new tears were detectable at angiography (P = .024); in 6 of 7 patients the new distal tears were subsequently resolved with placement of additional stents, whereas in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> new proximal tears determined a type I endoleak, which could not be resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall, TEE furnished decisive information additional to angiography in determining successful procedural changes in 16 of 42 patients (38%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, and pre-discharge spiral computed tomograms showed a good outcome of stent-graft implantation in 37 of 42 patients (88%), with 5 residual type I endoleaks, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> previously detected with TEE but impossible to eliminate with either balloon molding or further stent implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but 2 patients (95%) are currently alive at mean follow-up of 30 +/- 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TEE algorithm is an easy and useful tool in the operating room to guide correct stent-graft positioning in type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
