<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: As the shortcomings of the Bentall operation and its variants in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> have become apparent, the recent cusp-sparing techniques (remodeling or reimplantation) bear promise of better mid-term and long-term outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the results of aortic root surgery in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During the period March 1994 to September 2007, 220 patients underwent aortic valve-sparing surgery; 20 were Marfan patients (group 1) who were compared with another 20 Marfan patients undergoing composite aortic root replacement (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and 26 had thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 31 males and 9 females with a mean age of 37.9 +/- 13.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In group 1, reimplantation was used in 13 patients, remodeling in 4, and aortic valve repair with sinotubular junction replacement in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In group 2, a mechanical valve conduit was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean logistic Euroscore was 12.27 +/- 14.6% for the whole group, five of whom were emergent cases RESULTS: Group 2 had more previous cardiac procedures compared to group 1 (9 vs. 2, P = 0.03) and shorter cross-clamp time (122 +/- 27.1 vs. 153.9 +/- 23.7 minutes, P = 0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall mortality was 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Early mortality was 10% in group 2 and 5% in group 1 (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up time was 25 months for group 2 and 53 months for group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three patients were reoperated; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had undergone the remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Five year freedom from reoperation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 86% and 90% in group 2 and 70% and 95% in group 1 (P = 0.6, P = 0.6), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Late survival of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> was similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Root reconstruction tends towards a higher incidence of late reoperations if the remodeling technique is used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We now prefer to use the reimplantation technique </plain></SENT>
