<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Corneal distortion in contact lens wear can be produced by epithelial wrinkles, compression rings, and anterior corneal surface mosaic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>True corneal wrinkling can also occur but is an extremely rare phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These conditions can be manifested as alterations in keratometry and corneal topography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case report is presented of a 17-year-old patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Central corneal wrinkling developed in his right eye while he was wearing low-water-content hydrogel contact lenses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No visual discomfort or distortions were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patient was refitted with a non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34288">HEMA</z:chebi> hydrogel polymer contact lens, with no further episodes of corneal wrinkling observed during subsequent care of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This case represents an example of corneal wrinkling in a patient wearing hydrogel contact lenses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is unlikely this finding is related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
