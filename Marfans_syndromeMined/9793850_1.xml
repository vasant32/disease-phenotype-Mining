<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although an aortic valve fenestration usually has no pathologic significance, its association with aortic annular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> plays an important role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rupture of a myxomatously degenerated fibrous strand loaded with high tension from annular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> reducing the coaptation area of each cusp during diastole was the suspected cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> massive regurgitation by complete retroversion of the right coronary cusp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rupture of a fibrous strand of a fenestrated aortic valve with a dilated annulus could result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, for which prompt surgical repair is mandatory </plain></SENT>
