<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since other syndromes demonstrate similar vascular manifestations, but therapy may differ significantly, diagnosis should be established using the revised Ghent nosology in combination with genotypic analysis in specialized Marfan centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The formation of aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with the subsequent risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> type A (AADA) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003496" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic rupture</z:e> limits life expectancy in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, prophylactic replacement of the aortic root needs to be performed before the catastrophic event of AADA can occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The goal of surgery is the complete resection of pathological aortic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This can be achieved with excellent results by using a (mechanically) valved conduit that replaces both the aortic valve and the aortic root (Bentall operation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the need for lifelong anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10034">Coumadin</z:chebi> can be avoided using the aortic valve sparing reimplantation technique according to David </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The long-term durability of the reconstructed valve is favourable, and further technical improvements may improve longevity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although results of prospective randomised long-term studies comparing surgical techniques are lacking, the David operation has become the surgical method of choice for aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, not only at the Heidelberg Marfan Centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Replacement of the aneurysmal dilated aortic arch is performed under moderate hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> combined with antegrade cerebral perfusion using a heart-lung machine, which we also use in thoracic or thoracoabdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Close post-operative follow-up in a Marfan centre is pivotal for the early detection of pathological changes on the diseased aorta </plain></SENT>
