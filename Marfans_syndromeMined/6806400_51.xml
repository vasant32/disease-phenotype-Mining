<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alterations were observed in the organization of the dermis and in the individual collagen and elastic fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The major alterations observed among collagen fibrils were hieroglyphic-shaped fibrils, collagen flowers, unravelled fibrils and fibrils of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> shape but abnormally large or small diameters or a mixed population of both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Elastic fibrils were sometimes fragmented, highly branched, granular, densely stained and had inclusions suggestive of cellular debris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These changes appeared to be a consequence of degradative processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other fibers were seen with a paucity of elastin matrix associated with the microfibrils or with totally separate deposition of the two elastic fiber components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such fibers were barely visible by light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Alterations were observed in tissue concurrently regardless of whether the biochemical defect was related to only one of these connective tissue structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The observations support an hypothesis that alterations in one component of the connective tissue matrix may influence the deposition and structure of others, ultimately, modifying the overall organization and mechanical properties of the tissue </plain></SENT>
