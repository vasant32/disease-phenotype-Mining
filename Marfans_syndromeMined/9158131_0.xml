<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The technique of cerebral protection during hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven patients underwent operations for type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in the past 9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e>, selective cerebral perfusion and retrograde cerebral perfusion was applied in 12 and seven patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate was 28.6% in patients without adjunctive cerebral perfusion, 25.0% in selective cerebral perfusion patients, and zero in the retrograde cerebral perfusion group (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there was no mortality by cerebral injury in cerebral perfusion groups (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age (P = 0.001), hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> time (P = 0.012), and acuity (P = 0.013) were predisposing factors for cerebral injury, but cerebral perfusion has not yet been found to be a protective factor (P = 0.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine late reoperations and three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> was the only predisposing factor for late reoperation (P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, although further studies are still required, retrograde cerebral perfusion is a possible cerebral protective factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, periodic follow-up is mandatory, especially in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
