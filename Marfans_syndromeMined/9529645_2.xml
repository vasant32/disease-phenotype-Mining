<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis and treatment are important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the etiology of idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> remains unclear, there continues to be a search for genetic markers and studies for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>modes of inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> is more clearly understood recently and is recognized as a complex three-dimensional deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prognostic indicators for juvenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgical management of idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> continues to evolve, and now a thoracoscopic endoscopic technique is available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up has demonstrated generally satisfactory results with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>spinal fusion</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most are unresponsive to bracing and most often require surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
