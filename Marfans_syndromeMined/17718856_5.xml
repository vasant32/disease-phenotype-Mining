<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> may be hampered by the existence of very mild and atypical cases as well as by marked intrafamilial variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In these instances, molecular analysis of the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) can be helpful to identify individuals at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The underlying molecular mechanism for the clinical variability is presently unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed clinical and molecular studies in 36 subjects from three unrelated families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression studies of both FBN1 alleles were performed and related to the clinical severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In family 1, an overlapping phenotype between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265313" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Weill-Marchesani syndrome</z:e> is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis necessitated molecular studies and clinical examination in first-degree relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In family 2, the young proband presented with a phenotype overlapping between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and the kyphoscoliotic type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up over time and identification of a FBN1 mutation allowed confirmation of the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mutation analysis enabled us to identify family members with mild expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Family 3 illustrates the extensive intrafamilial variability in the clinical severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Identification of a FBN1 mutation was helpful to identify subjects with mild expression and for the timely diagnosis in a neonate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In families 2 and 3, the relative expression of both FBN1 alleles was not related to clinical severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that confirmation of the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> may require detailed and repeated clinical evaluation and thorough family history taking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>FBN1 mutation analysis is supportive for the diagnosis in mild and atypical presentations </plain></SENT>
