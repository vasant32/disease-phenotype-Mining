<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A single-base mutation that results in a skipping of exon 2 of FBN1 was found in a Marfan patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By sequencing this proband's entire FBN1 gene and comparing the mutated DNA sequence with proband's unaffected family numbers, we confirmed this alteration was the causative mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The skipping of exon 2 creates a frameshift and premature termination codon, and forms a truncated fibrillin-1 composed only of 55 amino acids of N-terminus plus 45 nonsense amino acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcription levels of the mutated FBN1 allele and the deposition of fibrillin-1 into extracellular matrix in fibroblast cells culture were assessed </plain></SENT>
