<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to examine the intraoperative echocardiographic features associated with recurrent severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> (AR) after an aortic valve repair surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Surgical valve repair for AR has significant advantages over valve replacement, but little is known about the predictors and mechanisms of its failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We blindly reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinical, pre-operative, intraoperative, and follow-up transesophageal echocardiographic data of 186 consecutive patients who underwent valve repair for AR during a 10-year period and in whom intraoperative and follow-up echo data were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up duration of 18 months, 41 patients had recurrent 3+ AR, 23 patients presented with residual 1+ to 2+ AR, and 122 had no or trivial AR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with recurrent 3+ AR, the cause of recurrent AR was the rupture of a pericardial patch in 3 patients, a residual cusp <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> in 26 patients, a restrictive cusp motion in 9 patients, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in 2 patients, and an infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pre-operatively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 groups were similar for aortic root dimensions and prevalence of bicuspid valve (overall 37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with recurrent AR were more likely to display <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> or type 3 dysfunction pre-operatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the opposite end, patients with continent AR repair at follow-up were more likely to have type 2 dysfunction pre-operatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After cardiopulmonary bypass, a shorter coaptation length, the degree of cusp billowing, a lower level of coaptation (relative to the annulus), a larger diameter of the aortic annulus and the sino-tubular junction, the presence of a residual AR, and the width of its vena contracta were associated with the presence of AR at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox analysis identified a shorter coaptation length (odds ratio [OR]: 0.8, p = 0.05), a coaptation occurring below the level of the aortic annulus (OR: 7.9, p &lt; 0.01), a larger aortic annulus (OR: 1.2, p = 0.01), and residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> (OR: 5.3, p = 0.01) as risk factors of repair failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography can be used to identify patients undergoing AR repair who are at increased risk for late repair failure </plain></SENT>
