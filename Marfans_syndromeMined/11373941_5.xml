<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>With advanced diagnostic and therapeutic techniques in pediatric cardiology and cardiac surgery, pregnancy can be an option for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A low overall maternal mortality and a healthy pregnancy require interdisciplinary cooperation between the cardiologist, obstetrician and general practitioner caring for the mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment and outcome will depend on the type of cardiac malformation, on the functional impairment of the maternal heart (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000961'>cyanosis</z:hpo>) and on the status of the fetus, with evidence of a better outcome for patients treated in specialized centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, even with recent advances in treatment, for women with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo>, Eisenmenger's syndrome, left heart obstruction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, pregnancy remains associated with a high maternal mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these are conditions in which pregnancy is still absolutely contraindicated and a patient should be counselled to terminate the pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk of an inherited recurrence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> is difficult to assess in an individual case because the majority of cardiac malformations are caused by multifactored variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>But for some types of malformations (i.e., <z:hpo ids='HP_0001674'>atrioventricular canal</z:hpo>, Morbus Fallot) the incidence of cardiac malformation in the offspring of affected parents is slightly higher compared to the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consequently, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> should be offered genetic counselling and fetal echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In general, pregnancy in women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> has no significant long-term adverse effects and a second pregnancy is possible in the majority of the cases </plain></SENT>
