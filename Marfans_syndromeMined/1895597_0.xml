<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The indication for operation was annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> in 40 patients (61%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in 26 (39%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The surgical techniques employed in this series included separate graft valve replacement (separate G/V) in 18 patients whose coronary ostia were normally placed, and composite graft replacement with coronary reimplantation (composite G) in 48 patients whose coronary ostia were displaced cephalad by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
