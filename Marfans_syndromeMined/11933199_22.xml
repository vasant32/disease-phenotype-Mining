<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Knowledge about FBN1 mutations is important for early diagnosis, management, and genetic counseling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, mutation detection in FBN1 is a challenge because the gene is very large in size ( approximately 200 kb) and the approximately 350 mutations detected so far are scattered over 65 exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conventional methods for large-scale detection of mutations are expensive, technically demanding, or time consuming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recently, a high-capacity low-cost mutation detection method was introduced based on denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To assess the sensitivity and specificity of this method, we blindly screened 64 DNA samples of known FBN1 genotype exon-by-exon using exon-specific DHPLC conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of 682 PCR amplicons correctly identified 62 out of 64 known sequence variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients of unknown FBN1 genotype, we detected two mutations and eight polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, 20 mutations and two polymorphisms are described here for the first time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate 1) that DHPLC is a highly sensitive (89-99%, P = 0.05) method for FBN1 mutation detection; but 2) that chromatograms with moderate and weak pattern abnormalities also show false positive signals (in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 45-59%, P = 0.05); 3) that the difference in the chromatograms of heterozygous and homozygous amplicons is mostly independent of the type of sequence change; and 4) that DHPLC column conditions, additional base changes, and the amounts of injected PCR products influence significantly the shape of chromatograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A strategy for FBN1 mutation screening is discussed </plain></SENT>
