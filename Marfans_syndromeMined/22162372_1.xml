<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the application of the Ghent and revised Ghent nosologies in adult Korean patients for whom there is suspicion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From January 1995 to June 2010, we enrolled 106 patients older than 20 years for whom there was suspicion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, and who had undergone genetic analysis of the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 106 patients, 86 patients (81%) fulfilled the criteria of the Ghent nosology, and 84 patients (79%) met the criteria of the revised Ghent nosology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two patients who met the Ghent nosology criteria, but not the criteria of the revised Ghent nosology were diagnosed with Loeys-Dietz syndrome and MASS phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The level of agreement between both nosologies was very high (Îº = 0.94, 95% confidence interval: 0.86 to 1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Marfan-like syndromes were diagnosed in 30% (6/20 patients) with negative Ghent and revised Ghent criteria and no FBN1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that adult Korean patients who fulfill the old Ghent criteria almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fulfill the new criteria for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
