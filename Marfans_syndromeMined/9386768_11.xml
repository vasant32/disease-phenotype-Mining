<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> often have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> due to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although composite replacement of the aortic valve and ascending aorta has been the standard treatment, an aortic valve-sparing operation is feasible in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aortic valve leaflets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1988 to 1996, 208 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> were operated on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aortic valve-sparing operations were performed in 101 patients: 70 men and 31 women with a mean age of 53 years (range, 14 to 82 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients had the stigmata of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and 8 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>Coronary artery disease</z:hpo> was detected in 19 patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> in 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two types of aortic valve-sparing operations were performed: remodeling of the aortic root with preservation of the aortic valve in 73 patients and reimplantation of the aortic valve in a tubular Dacron graft in 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up from 3 to 108 months (mean, 31 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Doppler echocardiographic studies were performed annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were two operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient had to have aortic valve replacement because of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were five late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>; the actuarial survival rate at 6 years was 87% +/- 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One patient required aortic valve replacement 2 years after the initial operation; the freedom from aortic valve replacement at 6 years was 97% +/- 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There have been no thromboembolic or infective complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Only 3 patients have moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo>; the remaining patients have mild or no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The midterm results of aortic valve-sparing operations have been excellent and justify their continued use in patients with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or near-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aortic valve leaflets </plain></SENT>
