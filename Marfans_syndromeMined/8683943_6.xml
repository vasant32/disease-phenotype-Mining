<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical and metabolic labeling studies in affected cattle have demonstrated abnormalities in fibrillin metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinically identified ocular features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007453" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bovine disease</z:e>, which are similar to human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1562061" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microspherophakia</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to compare the ocular pathology of the human and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007453" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bovine diseases</z:e> and to evaluate fibrillin-1 immunoreactivity in the extracellular matrix of explanted ciliary body cells from affected cattle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eyes from affected cattle and unrelated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cattle were examined grossly, and portions of the anterior uvea and ciliary zonule were examined by light and scanning electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Portions of the ciliary zonular fibers were examined by transmission electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results were compared between affected animals and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Explanted ciliary body cells from two affected cattle and one unaffected cow were grown on chambered microscope slides, and expression of fibrillin-1 in the extracellular matrix was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eyes of affected cattle were characterized by megaloglobus, increased circumlental distance, asymmetrical ciliary processes, intact but fragile zonular fibers, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Affected animals had moderately hypoplastic ciliary bodies, compact filtration angles, and long thin irises with decreased fibrous stroma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As shown by scanning electron microscopy, the zonular fibers of affected animals were wavy and loosely arranged, with abnormal sites of insertion on the lens capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The ciliary processes of affected animals had flattened or smooth surfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Explanted ciliary body cells from affected animals demonstrated decreased fibrillin immunoreactivity when compared with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The ocular pathology observed in bovine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> is, in most respects, similar to that described for the human disease and will be a useful model for studies of in vivo evaluation of abnormal microfibrillar aggregation within ocular structures </plain></SENT>
