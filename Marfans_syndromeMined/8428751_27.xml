<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The so-called neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (nMFS) is a lethal phenotype displaying features that are not seen in classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have therefore studied the biosynthesis and extracellular deposition of Fib and decorin in fibroblasts from a patient with nMFS and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence of the patient's cell cultures showed an almost complete absence of Fib and a marked reduction of decorin in the extracellular matrix (ECM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The nMFS skin revealed Fib on subbasal microfibrillar bundles in the papillary dermis, and Fib associated with elastic fibers in the reticular dermis; the bundles and fibers were fragmented and thinner than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pulse-chase labeling of cells with [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>]Met/Cys revealed moderately reduced secretion, but a diminished deposition of Fib in the ECM; this was more apparent at a longer chase time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fib <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and synthesis appeared to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, whereas both decorin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and biosynthesis were reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We therefore assume a structural Fib defect in this patient causing reduced deposition into and/or enhanced removal from the ECM, whereas the reduced decorin biosynthesis may be a secondary regulatory phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinical relevance of this remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings imply that Fib defects may be responsible for the severe, complex phenotype of nMFS </plain></SENT>
