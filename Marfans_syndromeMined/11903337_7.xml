<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the exact nature of sleep complaints in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A representative sample of Marfan and EDS patients responded to a general sleep questionnaire, including the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESS</z:e>) and the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 (SF-36) health-related quality of life (QOL) questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen Marfan patients and 9 EDS patients were evaluated and compared to 24 healthy controls, matched for age, sex and body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Maintaining sleep was frequently disturbed in Marfan (40%, p &lt; 0.04) as well as in EDS patients (56%, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>Sleep apnea</z:hpo> was exclusively reported by Marfan patients (27%, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Periodic limb movements were much more reported in EDS (67%, p = 0.02) than in Marfan (27%, p = 0.25) compared to controls (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pain and back complaints were highly presented in both groups, but most pronounced in EDS patients (47% in Marfan versus 77% in EDS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No differences for the scores in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESS</z:e> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SF-36 questionnaire items, scores were much lower in patient groups, except for emotional problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found that sleep complaints were not rare in Marfan and EDS patients and correlated well with different QOL items </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our study calls for greater attention to the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>, pain and periodic limb movements in these patients </plain></SENT>
