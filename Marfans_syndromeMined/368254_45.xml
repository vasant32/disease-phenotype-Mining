<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These fibers consist of 2 distinct components, elastin and the elastic fiber microfibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Controlled synthesis and balanced interaction of these 2 components are essential for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fibrillogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The intracellular biosynthesis of elastin by connective tissue cells, such as smooth muscle cells, involves assembly of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16541">polypeptide chains</z:chebi> on the membrane-bound ribosomes, hydroxylation of some <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26274,32874">prolyl</z:chebi> residues to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18095">hydroxyproline</z:chebi>, and secretion of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> packaged in Golgi vacuoles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the extracellular space the elastin molecules assemble into fiber structures which are stabilized by the synthesis of complex covalent cross-links, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37628">desmosines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recently, aberrations in the structure or metabolism of elastin have been detected in a variety of heritable and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277564" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">acquired diseases</z:e> affecting skin and other connective tissues </plain></SENT>
