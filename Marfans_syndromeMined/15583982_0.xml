<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To detect novel mutations in the fibrillin-1(FBN1) gene by screening the gene from 9 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) was used to screen for FBN1 mutation exon by exon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The DNA amplification fragments of which the DHPLC elution profiles showed difference in comparison with the corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elution profile were sequenced to identify the position and nature of mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The detected mutations were further proved by allele specific PCR or restriction fragment length polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two novel FBN1 gene mutations were found and identified in two Marfan patients respectively, one of which was a small insertion in exon 34 at nucleotide 4307-4308 (4307insTCGT) and the other a missense mutation in exon 43 at nucleotide 5309 (5309G&gt;A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings suggested that the frameshift mutation (4307insTCGT) and point mutation (5309G&gt;A) caused the corresponding patients to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
