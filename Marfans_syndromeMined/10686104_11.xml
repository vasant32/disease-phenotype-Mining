<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Calcium binding (cb) epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) domains are found in a wide variety of extracellular proteins with diverse functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In several proteins, including the fibrillins (1 and 2), the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> receptor, the Notch receptor and related molecules, these domains are organised as multiple tandem repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The functional importance of calcium-binding by EGF domains has been underscored by the identification of missense mutations associated with defective calcium-binding, which have been linked to human diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we present (15)N backbone relaxation data for a pair of cbEGF domains from fibrillin-1, the defective protein in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data were best fit using a symmetric top model, confirming the extended conformation of the cbEGF domain pair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that calcium plays a key role in stabilising the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> of the domain pair on the pico- to millisecond time-scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, the most dynamically stable region of the construct is centred about the domain interface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results provide important insight into the properties of intact fibrillin-1, the consequences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> causing mutations, and the ultrastructure of fibrillins and other extracellular matrix proteins </plain></SENT>
