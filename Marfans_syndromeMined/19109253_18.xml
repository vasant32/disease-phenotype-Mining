<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin-1 mutations are believed to promote abnormal Smad2/3 signaling by impairing the sequestration of latent TGF-beta complexes into the extracellular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report that promiscuous Smad2/3 signaling is the cell-autonomous phenotype of primary cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) explanted from the thoracic aortas of Fbn1 mutant mice with either <z:hpo ids='HP_0003623'>neonatal onset</z:hpo> or progressively severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cellular phenotype</z:mp> was characterized in VSMC isolated from Fbn1-null (mgN/mgN) mice, which recapitulate the most severe form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that loss of fibrillin-1 deposition promotes the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species and abnormal accumulation of phosphorylated TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 and p38 MAPK, in addition to increasing the levels of endogenous phospho-Smad2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We showed that improper Smad2/3 signaling in Fbn1-null VSMC is in part stimulated by phospho-p38 MAPK, which is in turn activated in response to signals other than those mediated by the kinase activity of the ALK5 receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these cell culture data, in vivo analyses documented that phospho-p38 MAPK accumulates earlier than phospho-Smad2 in the aortic wall of mgN/mgN mice and that systemic inhibition of phospho-p38 MAPK activity lowers the levels of phospho-Smad2 in this tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these findings indicate that improper activation of p38 MAPK is a precursor of constitutive Smad2/3 signaling in the aortic wall of a mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003811'>neonatal lethal</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
