<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgically resected tissue was used to initiate an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002669'>osteosarcoma</z:hpo> cell line (PSU-OS-M) that exhibits attachment-independent growth and loss of contact inhibition in vitro </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A two base pair insertion that results in a novel premature termination codon (PTC) was found in exon 52 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Protein from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> allele is detectable in PSU-OS-M cell-conditioned medium, but protein from the mutant allele was not detectable </plain></SENT>
