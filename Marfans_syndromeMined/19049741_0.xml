<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1978 and 2005, 273 patients with various disorders of the aortic root underwent a composite valve graft root replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the patients was 47.5 +/- 13.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 93 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, 56 <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp>, and 63 type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine emergency operations and 55 redo operations were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the proximal anastomosis, a skirted technique was used in 157 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the coronary reconstruction, Bentall's original inclusion technique was utilized in 36 patients, a direct button technique in 159, and a graft interposition technique in 63 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 106 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The in-hospital mortality was 9.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An emergency operation emerged as a significant predictor of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival rate was 87.0% and 72.9% at 5 and 15 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The age at the operation, <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and use of a standard proximal anastomosis emerged as independent determinants of late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The actuarial reoperation free rate was 96.3% and 89.7% at 5 and 15 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the patients who underwent the skirted technique the incidence of late graft detachment was less frequent than that of the standard technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A composite valve graft root replacement is a safe and reliable procedure for various aortic root diseases with stable early- and long-term results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The skirted technique seems to be attractive to avoid late graft detachment even in cases with a fragile inflammatory pathology </plain></SENT>
