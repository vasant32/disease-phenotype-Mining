<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the etiology of aortic wall dissection, a histopathological study of the aorta in 20 cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002622'>dissecting aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>), 3 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and 3 cases with annulo-aortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> (AAE) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Controls consisted of 348 cases of normally-aging aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In cases with aortic wall dissection, the histopathological changes in the undissected media were also carefully examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and AAE, there was a marked accumulation of acid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37395">mucopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (AMPS) and its distribution in the wall was diffuse in patients under 50 years old, resulting in changes in elastic fibers including fragmentation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306863" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elastolysis</z:e> and reticulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> was histopathologically characterized by zonal <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and abnormally-dilated vessels in the aortic media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These lesions were found in 8 (40%) of the 20 <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining 12 cases also had increased vascularization and fragmentation of elastic fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This medial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and increased vascularization were particularly marked in older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the 3 diseased entities responsible for aortic wall dissection, <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> differed distinctly from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> or AAE as to the amount and site of AMPS accumulation in the media as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and hypervascularity in the outer half of the aortic media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, aortic wall dissection in younger patients may be etiologically associated with the increased AMPS accumulation in the aortic media which may always be accompanied by degeneration of elastic fibers in this study, however, in older patients zonal <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and abnormal vessels developing in the media are responsible for the dissection </plain></SENT>
