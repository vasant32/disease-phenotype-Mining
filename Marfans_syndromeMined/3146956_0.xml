<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It must be noted that 12 patients were reoperation cases, 18 were operated upon in an emergency for tamponade (stage V) on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection, and 7 had lesions that involved the aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The operative procedure was that described by Bentall; Cabrol's modification was used in only 26 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most recent improvements concerned myocardial and (in case of aortic involvement) cerebral protection with an autonomous perfusion of blood at very low temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mortality was low in patients with annulo-aortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> (1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 53 cases; 1.8 p </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of mortality by stage showed virtually no risk in stages I and II, whereas 4 of the 9 stage IV patients died within the first post-operative month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Late mortality with a mean follow-up of 4 years was 14.2 p </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No case of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath> was observed, and the authors raise the question of whether long-term <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy should be abandoned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>None of the patients who underwent Bentall's operation were reoperated upon, whereas 7 out of the 23 patients who had had supracoronary aortic replacement before 1976 had been reoperated upon within a few years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
