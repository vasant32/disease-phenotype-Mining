<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This hereditary connective tissue abnormality resembles <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> in certain respects, but is characterized by <z:mp ids='MP_0003807'>camptodactyly</z:mp> rather than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001388'>joint laxity</z:hpo>, as well as by congenital contractural deformities of the knees and elbows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, there is a peculiar, fairly characteristic deformity of the external ear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, it is transmitted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite the superficial skeletal resemblance, however, the cardiovascular and ocular complications of Marfan's do not seem to occur and therefore differentiation of the two syndromes is important </plain></SENT>
