<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> type I (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS1</z:e>, MIM #154700) is caused by mutations in FBN1 encoding fibrillin-1, which is a major microfibrillar protein of elastic system fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS1</z:e> is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000098'>tall stature</z:hpo>, aortic/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> and is occasionally accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000166'>severe periodontitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since little is known about the biological functions of elastic system fibers in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="53413">PDLs</z:chebi> and the pathogenesis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS1</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="53413">PDL</z:chebi> cells were isolated from an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS1</z:e> patient with a heterozygous missense mutation in a calcium-binding epidermal-growth-factor-like domain of FBN1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Isolated <z:chebi fb="6" ids="53413">PDL</z:chebi> cells were immortalized by transducing a retrovirus carrying genes for the human Polycomb group protein, Bmi-1, and human telomerase reverse transcriptase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immortalized <z:chebi fb="6" ids="53413">PDL</z:chebi> cells from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS1</z:e> patient (termed M-HPL1) and those of a healthy volunteer (termed HPDL2) both expressed various <z:chebi fb="6" ids="53413">PDL</z:chebi>-related genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The growth and attachment of M-HPL1 and HPDL2 to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52254">hydroxyapatite</z:chebi> particles were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, when M-HPL1 were transplanted with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52254">hydroxyapatite</z:chebi> particles into immunodeficient mice, disorganized cell alignment and irregular microfibril assembly were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The activation of the signaling of transforming grwoth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is thought to cause the pathogenesis for lung and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001626'>cardiovascular abnormalities</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS1</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, M-HPL1 shows a higher level of activated TGF-beta than HPDL2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, M-HPL1 represent a powerful tool for clarifying the biological roles of elastic system fibers in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="53413">PDL</z:chebi> and the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS1</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings also suggest that FBN1 regulates cell alignment and microfibril assembly in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="53413">PDLs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
