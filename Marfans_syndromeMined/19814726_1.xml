<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Second-order mesenteric arteries from mice at 3, 6 and 10 months of age (n= 30) heterozygous for the Fbn1 allele encoding a cysteine substitution (Fbn1(C1039G/+)) were compared with those from age-matched control littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: Stress-strain curves indicated that arterial stiffness was increased at 6 and 10 months of age in Marfan vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Isometric force measurement revealed that contraction in response to <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> (60 mM)-induced membrane depolarization was decreased by at least 28% in Marfan vessels at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> (3 microM)-induced contraction was reduced by at least 40% from 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">Acetylcholine</z:chebi>-induced relaxation in Marfan vessels was reduced to 70% and 45% of control values, respectively, at 6 and 10 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> was reduced at 6 months (pEC(50)= 5.64 +/- 0.11, control pEC(50)= 7.34 +/- 0.04) and 10 months (pEC(50)= 5.99 +/- 0.07, control pEC(50)= 6.99 +/- 0.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with N(omega)-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">Nitro</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> (200 microM) had no effect on <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>-induced relaxation in Marfan vessels, but reduced vasorelaxation in control vessels to 57% of control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> (10 microM) and catalase (1000 U.mL(-1)) further inhibited vasorelaxation in Marfan vessels to a greater degree compared with control vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in resistance-sized arteries increases stiffness and impairs vasomotor function </plain></SENT>
