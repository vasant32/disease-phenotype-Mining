<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) is an autosomal, dominantly inherited, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> usually caused by a mutation in the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As fibrillin-1 is a component of the extracellular matrix of the myocardium, mutations in FBN1 may cause impairment of ventricular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, aortic elasticity is decreased in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, which might also impair ventricular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed biventricular function and the influence of aortic elasticity in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> by means of cardiac MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Cardiac magnetic resonance was performed in 144 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> without significant valvular dysfunction, previous cardiac surgery or previous aortic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biventricular diastolic and systolic volumes were measured, and ejection fractions were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Flow wave velocity, a measurable derivative of aortic elasticity, was measured between the ascending aorta and the bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When compared to healthy controls (n = 19), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was impaired in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> (53% ± 7% vs 57% ± 4%, p &lt; 0.005), as was right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) (51% ± 7% vs 56% ± 4%, p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LVEF and RVEF were strongly correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(r = 0.7, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between patients with β-blocker treatment and those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between aortic elasticity as measured by flow wave velocity and LVEF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Biventricular ejection fraction was impaired in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, and the impairment was independent of aortic elasticity and β-blocker usage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was also a strong correlation between LVEF and RVEF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest intrinsic myocardial dysfunction in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
