<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>DESPITE THE CATASTROPHIC consequence of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>, very little is understood regarding their pathogenesis, and there are no reliable predictive markers for identifying at-risk individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given that <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> have a strong but complex genetic component and well-characterized modifiable risk factors, it seems likely that the most valuable approach to developing minimally invasive diagnostic and prognostic tools will involve a multifactorial model that includes both genetic and environmental risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, the genetic basis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> is poorly described, and reports describing the association of nonrandom <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16991">deoxyribonucleic acid</z:chebi> sequence variation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> have been limited to a handful of ad hoc studies that have focused on a variety of markers in small populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One reason for this lack of coordinated analysis of the genetic basis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> is that the molecular pathogenesis and pathobiological characteristics of the disease are poorly described, so candidate marker selection has been problematic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Few studies have addressed the molecular pathological basis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> or the possible mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this regard, candidate gene selection strategies have relied almost exclusively on limited knowledge of monogenic disorders such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> is a feature of a spectrum of syndromic phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Without exception, these approaches have not affected the clinical identification and/or management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is imperative that coordinated large-scale efforts in genetics, molecular biology, and genetic epidemiology are implemented to overcome these obstacles and drive developments in the field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this review, we summarize the current screening modalities for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>, review the current state of understanding relating to the genetic basis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>, and suggest a broader theory of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> pathogenesis to form the foundation of a coordinated molecular search for biological markers that may be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation and rupture </plain></SENT>
