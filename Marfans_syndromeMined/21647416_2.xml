<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In previous work, we showed that extracts of aortic tissues from the mgR mouse model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> showed increased chemotactic stimulatory activity related to the elastin-binding protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aortic samples were collected from 6 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and 8 with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Soluble proteins extracted from the aortic samples of the two patient groups were compared against buffer controls and against the aortic samples from controls with respect to the ability to induce macrophage chemotaxis as measured using a modified Boyden chamber, as well as the reactivity to a monoclonal antibody BA4 against bioactive elastin <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> using ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Samples from Marfan patients displayed a statistically significant increase in chemotactic inductive activity compared to control samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, reactivity to BA4 was significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar statistically significant increases were identified for the samples from patients with idiopathic thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between the chemotactic index and BA4 reactivity, and the increases in chemotactic activity of extracts from Marfan patients could be inhibited by pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="17716">lactose</z:chebi>, VGVAPG <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, or BA4, which indicates the involvement of EBP in mediating the effects </plain></SENT>
