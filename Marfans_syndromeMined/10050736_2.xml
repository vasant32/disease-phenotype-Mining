<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Revised criteria for the clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> regard skeletal involvement as a major criterion if at least four of eight typical skeletal manifestations are present, one of which is <z:hpo ids='HP_0003179'>protrusio acetabuli</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using Kulman's method to determine the presence of protrusio, we analysed the pelvic X-rays of 15 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and 15 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Protrusio was present in 47% (7/15) of Marfan patients, compared with 7% (1/15) of controls (P = 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using the revised criteria, the presence of protrusio would have affected the final diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> in only one patient out of 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we recommend that a pelvic X-ray is reserved for those cases in which the presence of protrusio will alter the final diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With regard to the radiological assessment of protrusio, in our opinion this can be performed simply and reliably using the position of the acetabular line alone </plain></SENT>
