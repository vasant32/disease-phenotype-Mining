<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The 21 women who were receiving follow-up for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> at our institution, were free of major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, and consented to the study performed isokinetic and isometric knee extension and flexion maximal strength tests and had their body composition evaluated using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The same assessments were done in 19 matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant decrease in lean leg mass with no change in total soft-tissue leg mass was noted in the patients compared with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Peak torque values for the quadriceps and hamstring muscle groups were decreased in the patients, but only quadriceps strength was significantly reduced after normalization for lean leg mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The muscle strength reduction in Marfan patients was not fully explained by a decrease in lean leg mass, suggesting qualitative skeletal-muscle alterations related to abnormal fibrillin expression in muscle connective tissue </plain></SENT>
