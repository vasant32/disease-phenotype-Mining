<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> of visceral arteries are rare, but in case of rupture, they are potentially life threatening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, there is a broad spectrum of the anatomic variability for the arterial supply of the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Based on a real but very rare clinical case, including its diagnostic management and short-term course, the extraordinary coincidence of (i) an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the gastroduodenal artery at its branching off from the hepatic artery and (ii) occurrence of hepatomesenteric trunk is described by the means of a scientific medical case report as well as an adequate and selective literature search </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION, THERAPEUTIC DECISION AND CLINICAL COURSE: A 39-year-old woman (BMI, 24 kg/m) was diagnosed (by coincidence) with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the proper hepatic artery (APHA) with overlap to the gastroduodenal artery in combination with an uncommon hepatomesenteric trunk using abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan (because of slight but recurrent episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042075" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">urinary tract diseases</z:e>) and, subsequently, systematic diagnostic comprising Duplex ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, medical history was not significant for coincidence with possibly relevant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> occlusive disease, mycotic embolization, trauma, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome</z:e> or giant cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite a moderate progression within a year to a size of actually 18 mm, we still favor watchful-waiting at this size (therapeutic [interventional] consequence, size &gt;â€‰20 mm) with short-term intervals for follow-up investigations using Duplex ultrasonography as the method of choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case in the accessible English-speaking literature to show this very infrequent coincidence especially indicating rare appearance of an APHA in combination with an also infrequent hepatomesenteric trunk (which potentiates the uncommon occurrence of such combination) based on the high anatomic variability of the arterial supply of the liver from the anatomic perspective </plain></SENT>
