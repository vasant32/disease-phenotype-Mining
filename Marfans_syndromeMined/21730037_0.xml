<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Elastin is the primary component of elastic fibres in arteries, which contribute significantly to the structural integrity of the wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin-1 is a microfibrillar <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> that appears to stabilize elastic fibres mechanically and thereby to delay a <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>-induced loss of function due to long-term repetitive loading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whereas prior studies have addressed some aspects of ageing-related changes in the overall mechanical properties of arteries in mouse models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, we sought to assess for the first time the load-carrying capability of the elastic fibres early in maturity, prior to the development of ageing-related effects, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, or dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We used elastase to degrade elastin in common carotid arteries excised, at 7-9 weeks of age, from a mouse model (mgR/mgR) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> that expresses fibrillin-1 at 15-25% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro biaxial mechanical tests performed before and after exposure to elastase suggested that the elastic fibres exhibited a nearly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> load-bearing capability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Observations from nonlinear optical microscopy suggested further that competent elastic fibres not only contribute to load-bearing, they also increase the undulation of collagen fibres, which endows the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> arterial wall with a more compliant response to pressurization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings support the hypothesis that it is an accelerated <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>-induced damage to or protease-related degradation of initially competent elastic fibres that render arteries in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> increasingly susceptible to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, dissection, and rupture </plain></SENT>
