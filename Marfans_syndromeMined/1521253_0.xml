<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our previous works we supported the presence of morphological and functional alterations of the microcirculation in patients affected by MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to characterize a possible common denominator between these pathologies we have studied the cutaneous microcirculation in a group of patients affected by MVP, divided into 2 groups: anatomic MVP (MVP) and MVP syndrome (MVPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The morphologic parameters have been investigated by nailfold capillaroscopy while digital laser-Doppler was used to study skin flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results have been compared with a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Capillaroscopic remarkers showed an architecturally disorganized microvasculature with aspects related to a reduced compactness of the microvasculature unit with a significatively higher score compared with controls (7.3 +/- 2.9 vs 3.6 +/- 1 p less than 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Laser-Doppler flowmetry showed a significatively reduced rest flow; ischemic test showed: spike time 48.9 +/- 36.9 vs 15.3 +/- 7.7 s (p less than 0.0005), hyperemic acme 6.6 +/- 2.7 vs 12.5 +/- 8.4 UP (p less than 0.002); % increase 32.1 +/- 20.2 vs 51.5 +/- 15.4 (p less than 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thermic test showed a significatively higher thermic acme 8.7 +/- 4.2 vs 12.6 +/- 9.11 UP (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results appeared to be correlated with stage pathology as it was observed a severe microvasculature disorders in MVPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore we suppose that a phenotypic continuum may exist between MS and MVP </plain></SENT>
