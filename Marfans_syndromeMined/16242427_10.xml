<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Aortic valve-sparing root replacement has become an established treatment for adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta, but there is limited experience in children, for whom the advantages of avoiding valve prostheses are particularly attractive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective clinical study was undertaken to examine results of aortic valve-sparing operations in pediatric patients at a single institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical and echocardiographic data were obtained from chart review and outpatient follow-up examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 1997 and 2004, 19 children underwent aortic valve-sparing root replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 12.2 +/- 4.4 years, and mean weight was 51.5 +/- 22.9 kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median length of clinical follow-up was 58 months (range, 5 to 91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of 19 patients (78.9%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and 1 had aortic root dilation late after the arterial switch operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean preoperative root diameter was 4.7 +/- 0.6 cm, with an average Z score of 7.7 +/- 1.9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients (73.7%) underwent root remodeling, whereas 5 (26.3%) had a reimplantation procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient required concomitant mitral valve repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no operative mortality and only 1 reoperation for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (5.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median length of hospital stay was 5 days (range, 3 to 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At latest follow-up, 3 of 19 patients (15.8%) have required late aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients have no or mild <z:mp ids='MP_0006047'>aortic valve insufficiency</z:mp>, and 1 has moderate but stable valve regurgitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No patient with a reimplantation procedure has had a reoperation or more than mild insufficiency, and no patient has suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Valve-sparing aortic root replacement is a viable alternative to root replacement with mechanical or biological prostheses in children, and can be accomplished with minimal morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Reimplantation procedures appear to have more durable results than root remodeling techniques, and should be strongly considered for pediatric patients with aortic root enlargement secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> and other forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
