<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From May 1988 to June 2000, 120 patients with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> underwent aortic valve-sparing operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 83 men and 37 women whose mean age was 46 years (range 16 to 72 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight patients had the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and 22 had either <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reconstruction of the aortic root was performed using the technique of reimplanation of the aortic valve in 64 patients and the remodeling of the aortic root in 56 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 35 months (range 2 to 145 months), and it was complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aortic valve function was assessed by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 2 operative and 5 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 10-year survival for patients with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was 88% +/- 4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients have required aortic root replacement: one on the first postoperative day because of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> and one paraplegic patient 12 years after surgery because of infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> with aortic root <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both patients survived reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 10-year freedom from aortic root reoperation was 99% +/- 1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three patients suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The 10-year freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> was 89% +/- 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> at the latest echocardiographic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The 10-year freedom from severe or moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> was 83% +/- 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Aortic valve-sparing operations have provided excellent clinical outcomes and few valve-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The function of the reconstructed aortic root remains unchanged in most patients during the first decade of follow-up </plain></SENT>
