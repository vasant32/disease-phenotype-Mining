<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The state of knowledge about <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> and reproductive changes in ageing men as well as possible age-related paternal genetic risks lags far behind </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In general serum <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> levels decrease with increasing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In ageing men testis <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and semen production can be absolutely <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in some testes degenerative forms of germ cells can be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fertility may be maintained up to a very high age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The genetic quality of sperm produced by older men may be reduced for several reasons, among which age-related increases in germ cell mutations, impairment of DNA-repair mechanisms and apoptotic processes are the most likely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of several <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> diseases, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis coli</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> or basal cell naevi is associated with advanced paternal age, whereas there is no clear evidence for a <z:mp ids='MP_0010723'>paternal effect</z:mp> on structural or numeric chromosome anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hence even if offspring of older men have a slightly increased incidence of certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic diseases</z:e>, the individual risk of such a new disease must be considered as extremely small, as the incidence of these diseases is very low </plain></SENT>
