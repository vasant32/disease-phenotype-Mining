<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Until recently the surgical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the aortic root in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> consisted of composite replacement of the aortic valve and ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the present, almost one-half of these patients can have reconstruction of the aortic root with preservation of the aortic valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mitral valve can also be frequently preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1988 to 1996, 46 patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> underwent cardiac surgery; the aortic valve was preserved in 23 and replaced in 26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mitral valve was repaired in 3 patients who had aortic valve-sparing operations, and it was repaired in 3 and replaced in 3 who had aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both groups of patients had similar clinical profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 2 operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> among patients who had aortic valve replacement but neither one was valve-related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient who had aortic valve-sparing operation needed aortic valve replacement 2 years postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no other valve-related complications in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival was 100% at 5 years for this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients needed reoperations for valve-related complications in the group who had composite replacement of the aortic valve and ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival was 88% +/- 4% at 5 years in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the number of patients in each group is small and the follow-up relatively short, aortic valve-sparing operations have given gratifying results and may prove superior to valve replacement in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
