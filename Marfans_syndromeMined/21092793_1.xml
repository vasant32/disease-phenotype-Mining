<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We suggest standardizing aortic valve repair using a physiologic approach by associating root remodeling with resuspension of the cusp effective height and external subvalvular aortic ring annuloplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 187 patients underwent remodeling associated with subvalvular aortic ring annuloplasty (14 centers, 24 surgeons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three strategies for cusp repair were evaluated: group 1, gross visual estimation (74 patients); group 2, alignment of cusp free edges (62 patients); and group 3, 2-step approach, alignment of the cusp free edges and effective height resuspension (51 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The composite outcome was defined as recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> of grade 2 or greater and/or reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The operative mortality rate was 3.2% (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of a cusp lesion was most frequently performed in group 3 (70.6% vs 20.3% in group 1 and 30.6% in group 2, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine patients required reoperation during a follow-up period of 24 months (range, 12-45), 6 patients in group 1 and 3 patients in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 1 year, no patients in group 3 presented with composite outcome events compared with 28.1% in group 1 and 15% in group 2 (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> and tricuspid <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> were independent risk factors for the composite outcome in groups 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The annulus diameter, the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and cusp repair had no effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> recurrence or reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A standardized and physiologic approach to aortic valve repair, considering both the aorta (root remodeling) and the valve (resuspension of the cusp effective height and subvalvular ring annuloplasty) improved the preliminary results and might affect their long-term durability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The ongoing Conservative Aortic Valve Surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>Aortic Insufficiency</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysm</z:hpo> of the Aortic Root (CAVIAAR) trial will compare this strategy to mechanical valve replacement </plain></SENT>
