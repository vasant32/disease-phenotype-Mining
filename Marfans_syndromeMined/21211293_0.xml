<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four affected and two unaffected individuals in the family were recruited after informed consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five ml blood samples were drawn from each family member and genomic DNA was extracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations were detected by directly sequencing to the whole coding region and exon-intron boundaries of FBN1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Polyphen program was used to predict the functional and structural changes of the mutant protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four affected individuals carried FBN1gene mutations, c.2261A &gt; G (p.Y754C), in exon18 by sequence analysis, while two unaffected family members and 100 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls did not have this mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A PSIC score of 2.6 was acquired by Polyphen program analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study supports that FBN1 gene mutation, c.2261A &gt; G (p.Y754C), is the underlying molecular pathogenesis of this family with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This mutation is identified for the first time in Chinese population </plain></SENT>
