<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histopathologic and ultrastructural abnormalities in the elastic fibers have been observed in several diseases of the skin and other tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent cloning of several genes involved in elastic fiber architecture has lead to the approach of the study of elastic fiber genodermatoses through molecular analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in genodermatoses, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033847" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PXE">pseudoxanthoma elasticum</z:e>, many of the genes encoding elastic fiber components have been excluded by genetic linkage analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In recent years, mutations in several of the genes encoding elastic fiber proteins have been demonstrated in other diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These include mutations in the fibrillin 1 gene in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and genetic linkage of congenital contractural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo> to fibrillin 2, and, most recently, demonstration of abnormalities in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022716" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MNK">Menkes syndrome</z:e> gene in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000973'>cutis laxa</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first disorders to involve mutations in the elastin gene itself are, surprisingly, cardiovascular and neurobehavioral disorders, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004381'>supravalvular aortic stenosis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175702" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Williams syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that additional, as yet undiscovered, components of the elastic fiber network in the skin may hold the key to unraveling the molecular basis of the elastin-related genodermatoses </plain></SENT>
