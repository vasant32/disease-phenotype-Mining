<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to emphasise the necessity of a widely applicable method of morpho-clinical diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was confirmed on surgical biopsies from ascending aortic wall and aortic cusps, using routine morphological techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The macroscopical examination revealed a thin ascending aortic wall, presenting a transversal intimal tear, without secondary dissecting <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, and an aortic dilated annulus, producing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microscopically, the diagnosis was supported by the identification of cystic medical <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, a specific degenerative lesion in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan Syndrome</z:e>, in patients with or without family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study defines the morpho-clinical changes of the disease, emphasising the necessity of a permanent monitorization of the patient after surgery, due to the risk of late complications </plain></SENT>
