<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their importance is underscored by fibrillin-1 mutations responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, but their respective roles are still incompletely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here on two families where children from healthy, consanguineous parents, presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000485'>megalocornea</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>impaired vision</z:hpo> associated with small, round, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>dislocated lenses</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1562061" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microspherophakia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo>, as well as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000156'>high-arched palate</z:hpo>, and, in older children, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000098'>tall stature</z:hpo> with an abnormally large arm span over body height ratio, that is, associated features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>Glaucoma</z:hpo> was not present at birth, but was diagnosed in older children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whole genome homozygosity mapping followed by candidate gene analysis identified homozygous truncating mutations of LTBP2 gene in patients from both families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fibroblast <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> analysis was consistent with nonsense-mediated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> decay, with no evidence of mutated exon skipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that biallelic null LTBP2 mutations cause the ocular phenotype in both families and could lead to Marfan-like features in older children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that intraocular pressures should be followed-up in young children with an ocular phenotype consisting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000485'>megalocornea</z:hpo>, spherophakia and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>lens dislocation</z:hpo>, and recommend LTBP2 gene analysis in these patients </plain></SENT>
