<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: distraction osteogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients(three girls and one boy) aged from 4 to 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two were with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e>, one with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> and one with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One was treated with Le Fort III external distraction, two with Le Fort III internal distraction, and the other with monobloc internal distraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distraction devices were activated on the fourth postoperative day at 1 mm per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients completed the distraction as activated on the fourth postoperative day at 1 mm per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results was planned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Successful advancement of 8 to 20 mm was obtained at the occlusal level in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients as measured by cephalograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The facial appearance was significantly improved,especially in the orbits and the upper part of the nose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follow-up from 4 months to one year demonstrated that the face was symmetrical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients obtained This study shows that although midface distraction osteogenesis needs to be satisfactory results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that although midface distraction osteogenesis needs to be improved to increase its controllability, it has obvious advantages over the traditional way of bone graft and rigid fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Midface distraction avoids bone grafts and alleviates the restriction of the soft tissue to midfacial bone advancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Midface distraction osteogenesis is an effective and practical way to correct severe syndromic midfacial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
