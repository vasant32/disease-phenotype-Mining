<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated whether ascending aortic samples from the fibrillin-1-underexpressing mgR mouse model for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> or a recombinant fibrillin-1 fragment containing an elastin-binding protein (EBP) recognition sequence can act as chemotactic stimuli for macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both the aortic extracts from the mgR/mgR mice and the fibrillin-1 fragment significantly increased macrophage chemotaxis compared with extracts from <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice or buffer controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The chemotactic response was significantly diminished by pretreatment of macrophages with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="17716">lactose</z:chebi> or with the elastin-derived <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> VGVAPG and by pretreatment of samples with a monoclonal antibody directed against an EBP recognition sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutation of the EBP recognition sequence in the fibrillin-1 fragment also abolished the chemotactic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate the involvement of EBP in mediating the effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, investigation of macrophages in aortic specimens of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients demonstrated macrophage infiltration in the tunica media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that aortic extracts from mgR/mgR mice can stimulate macrophage chemotaxis by interaction with EBP and show that a fibrillin-1 fragment possesses chemotactic stimulatory activity similar to that of elastin degradation <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They provide a plausible molecular mechanism for the inflammatory infiltrates observed in the mgR mouse model and suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> may represent a component of the complex pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
