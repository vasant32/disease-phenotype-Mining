<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>29-year-old female with AR due to AAE associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> underwent the replacement of ascending aorta by sparing an aortic valve with good result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under cardiopulmonary bypass, the proximal ascending aorta was dissected circumferentially down to the ventriculo-aortic junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aneurysmal aorta and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three sinuses of valsalva were excised, leaving 7 mm of arterial wall attached to the aortic valve and small buttons of arterial wall around the both left and right coronary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aortic valve was reimplanted inside a 28 mm Dacron graft which was calculated by aortic valve leaflet height </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The left coronary artery was reimplanted to the graft by interposing a short 10 mm Dacron graft between coronary ostia and graft and the right coronary artery was anastomosed directly to the graft (Piehler's procedure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We called these procedure "modified David's operation" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient has survived the operative procedure without any complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative aortogram showed a competent aortic valve and the peak systolic pressure gradient across the aortic valve was 20 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We believe this new procedure preserving the native aortic valve is useful for preventing from some complications associated with artificial heart valves </plain></SENT>
