<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the neurodevelopmental status and cognitive ability of 30 school-age children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found average intellectual (mean full scale IQ = 109.3) and gross motor development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent had one or more neuropsychologic deficits: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751265" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">learning disability</z:e> (LD) (13%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0007018'>attention deficit disorder</z:hpo> with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> (ADD +/- H) (17%), neuromaturational immaturity (NMI) (10%), and a performance IQ score different from their verbal score by more than 20 points (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with a large verbal-performance discrepancy, with one exception, scored lower on tests of performance, and particularly low on two subtests, object assembly and coding, compared with the rest of the patients (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The factor most highly correlated with verbal-performance discrepancy was the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001382'>joint hypermobility</z:hpo> (P = 0.02), which suggests that the depressed performance score was due, in part, to motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0002311'>incoordination</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> may be prone to neuropsychologic problems; the role of routine screening remains to be tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Those with hand-wrist hypermobility seem at particular risk for difficulties with tasks that involve writing and should receive careful evaluation in the classroom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Due to the high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> in these patients, if stimulant medications are considered for treatment of ADD +/- H, the risk of adverse <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35524">sympathomimetic</z:chebi> effect should be weighed against the potential benefit </plain></SENT>
