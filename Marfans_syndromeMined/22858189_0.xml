<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Aortic root dilation is important in the diagnosis of familial aortic syndromes, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and an important risk factor for aortic complications, such as dissection or rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transthoracic echocardiography reliably measures the absolute aortic root size; however, the degree of abnormality of the measurement requires correction for the expected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aortic root size for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> size is currently predicted according to the body surface area (BSA) and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the correlation between root size and BSA is imperfect, particularly for older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A potential exists to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e>, with an improved estimation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aortic root size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A reference size derived from within the cardiovascular system has been hypothesized to provide a more direct correlation with the aortic root size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Images from the Stanford echocardiography database were reviewed, and measurements of the aortic root and internal dimensions were performed in a control cohort (n = 150) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The measurements were repeated in adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (n = 70) on serial echocardiograms (145 total studies reviewed) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 150 control patients, excellent correlation was found between the aortic root and left ventricular outflow tract diameters, r(2) = 0.67, and r(2) = 0.34 with BSA (p &lt;0.0001, for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More importantly, using the left ventricular outflow tract to predict the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aortic root size, instead of the BSA and age, improved the diagnostic accuracy of aortic root measurements for diagnosing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, an internal cardiovascular reference, the left ventricular outflow tract diameter, can improve the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> and might provide a better reference for the degree of abnormality </plain></SENT>
