<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over the past few years, investigations of patients with the major forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heritable disorders</z:e> of connective tissue, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029434" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteogenesis imperfecta</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e> have revealed genetic mutations of collagen genes as the cause of the diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Review of the newest genetic information in these three disorders is presented </plain></SENT>
