<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A skin biopsy contains the macromolecules present in most connective tissues: collagens, elastin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The specific combination and assembly of these matrix components and their interactions with other structures (e.g., epidermal appendages, nerve and vascular networks) and cells are responsible for the distinction among specific regions of the dermis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The matrix components are interactive and interdependent and modification of one of them, by extrinsic (environmental) and/or intrinsic (systemic, genetic, age-related) factors, may have consequences on the tissue as a whole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The skin, therefore, provides a window through which it is possible to examine how mutations in one connective tissue <z:chebi fb="4" ids="33839">macromolecule</z:chebi> can change the interactions among matrix components and affect tissue structure and organization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Light and electron microscopic studies of skin from patients with inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> (e.g., <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029434" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteogenesis imperfecta</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000973'>cutis laxa</z:hpo>) have led us to the following generalizations about what components change, how individual collagen or elastic fibers are altered and how individual alterations affect overall dermal organization: 1) There is a limited change in the repertoire of collagen fibrils in the skin; 2) there appears to be a greater range of abnormal structure in dermal elastic fibers than in the collagen fibrils; 3) the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the fibroblastic cells may provide clues to the defect in matrix components; 4) similar structural abnormalities result from different molecular defect; 5) a molecular defect in one connective tissue molecule has consequences for the structural properties of other connective tissue components; and 6) although structural alterations in connective tissue fibers are rarely specific for a given disease, there are characteristic patterns of structural change in the matrix that may be used to confirm a diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These generalizations show that mutations rarely affect only a single aspect of macromolecular function and because of the interactions of matrix components in this complex organ (skin) often disturb the organization of the entire dermis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genotype-phenotype relationships are important to understand if effective therapies are to be designed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The structure of skin should provide the next level of integration in our efforts to determine how mutations produce disease </plain></SENT>
