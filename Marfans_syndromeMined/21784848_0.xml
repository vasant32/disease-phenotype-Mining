<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fibrillins form the backbone of extracellular matrix microfibrils in tissues including blood vessels, bone, and skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They are crucial for regulating elastic fiber biogenesis and growth factor bioavailability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To compare the molecular consequences of mutations causing the severe neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> with mutations causing the milder classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, we introduced representative point mutations from each group in a recombinant human fibrillin-1 fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Structural effects were analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy and analytical gel filtration chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proteolytic susceptibility was probed with non-physiological and physiological proteases, including plasmin, thrombin, matrix metalloproteinases, and cathepsins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> mutant proteins showed a similar gross secondary structure and no differences in heat stability as compared with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Proteins harboring neonatal mutations were typically more susceptible to proteolytic cleavage compared with those with classical mutations and the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Proteolytic neo-cleavage sites were found both in close proximity and distant to the mutations, indicating small but significant structural changes exposing cryptic cleavage sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also report for the first time that cathepsin K and V cleave non-mutated fibrillin-1 at several domain boundaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared with the classical mutations and the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp>, the group of neonatal mutations more severely affected the ability of fibrillin-1 to interact with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24500">heparan</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi>, which plays a role in microfibril assembly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest differential molecular pathogenetic concepts for neonatal and classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> including enhanced proteolytic susceptibility for physiologically relevant enzymes and loss of function for <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> binding </plain></SENT>
