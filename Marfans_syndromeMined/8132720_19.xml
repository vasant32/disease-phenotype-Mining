<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, fibrillin synthesis, deposition and assembly has been investigated in Marfan dermal fibroblast lines from two unrelated patients for whom distinct mutations in the fibrillin gene FBN1 have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patient NB, a point mutation has occurred which causes an amino acid substitution and the other patient (GK) has a deletion in one allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two cell lines were broadly comparable with respect to de novo fibrillin synthesis and its distribution between medium and cell layer compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electrophoresis of fibrillin immunoprecipitates confirmed the presence of fibrillin in medium and cell layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GK cells secreted an additional higher relative molecular mass fibrillin-immunoreactive component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The time-course of fibrillin secretion was similar for the two lines, but differences in fibrillin aggregation were apparent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rotary shadowing electron microscopy of extracted cell layers demonstrated the presence of abundant and extensive microfibrils in NB cell layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These were abnormal in their gross <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in comparison to microfibrils isolated from control cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No periodic microfibrillar structures were isolated from GK cell layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These studies underline the need to classify fibrillin defects in terms of biochemical and ultrastructural criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Examination of the effects of individual mutations on microfibril organization will be particularly informative in elucidating the relationship between microfibril dysfunction and the complex clinical manifestations of Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
