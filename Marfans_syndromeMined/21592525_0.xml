<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> is thought to increase with descending thoracic aortic diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, elective repair of the descending thoracic aorta is indicated for an aortic diameter of 5.5 cm or greater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to investigate the relationship between aortic diameter and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, and the utility of aortic diameter as a predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the descending aortic diameter at presentation of 613 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> who were enrolled in the International Registry of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic Dissection</z:hpo> between 1996 and 2009, and analyzed the subset of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> with an aortic diameter less than 5.5 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median aortic diameter at the level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> was 4.1 cm (range 2.1-13.0 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only 18.4% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in the International Registry of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic Dissection</z:hpo> had an aortic diameter of 5.5 cm or greater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> represented 4.3% and had a slightly larger aortic diameter than patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (4.68 vs 4.32 cm, P = .121) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> was more common among patients with an aortic diameter of 5.5 cm or greater (52.2% vs 35.6%, P &lt; .001), and the in-hospital mortality for patients with an aortic diameter less than 5.5 cm and 5.5 cm or greater was 6.6% and 23.0% (P &lt; .001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> present with a descending aortic diameter less than 5.5 cm before dissection and are not within the guidelines for elective descending thoracic aortic repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aortic diameter measurements do not seem to be a useful parameter to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, and other methods are needed to identify patients at risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
