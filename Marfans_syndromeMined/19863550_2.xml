<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although clinical and genetic analyses have been performed in various populations, there have been few studies in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics and genetic background of Korean patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 39 Korean patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> who met the Ghent criteria, the most common clinical finding was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> and/or dissection (94.9%), whereas only 35.9% of patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients had fewer than four of the skeletal findings required to fulfill the major skeletal Ghent criterion for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only 21% of Korean patients had major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>skeletal abnormalities</z:hpo> and most cases showed only minor skeletal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FBN1 gene mutations were detected in 35 out of 39 patients (89.7%), which is similar to rates presented in the previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that some clinical features in Korean patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> differed from those reported in Western <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
