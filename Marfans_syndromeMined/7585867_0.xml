<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both phenomena drew attention to the importance of control of expression of different alleles and their genetic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The causes of the two syndromes have not been elucidated unequivocally so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In case of the PWS, at least, there is the possibility of a gene of the protein carrier of a small nuclear <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33697">ribonucleic acid</z:chebi> described as SNRPN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> the responsible gene is the fibrillin gene (FNB1) with the locus on area 15q21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mentioned gene participates probably also in diseases caused by a change of the vascular wall (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>) and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> of the mitral valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the 15th chromosome are several representatives of the family of genes of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P450</z:chebi> the products of which play a part in the metabolism of exogenous substances, incl. pharmaceutical ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their activity is part of the natural sensitivity or resistance to some chemical cancerogens </plain></SENT>
