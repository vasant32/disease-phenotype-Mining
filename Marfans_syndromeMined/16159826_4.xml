<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: From July, 1993, to July, 2004, 284 patients underwent AVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 53+/-16 (range 8 to 84) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 284 patients, 184 were male (64.8%) and 54 (19%) experienced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> Stanford type A was present in 53 patients (19%) and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> was present in 17 patients (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concomitant arch replacement was necessary in 120 patients (42%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional procedures were performed in 66 patients (23.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up time was 41+/-32 (range 0 to 130) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 30-day mortality was 3.2% overall, 11.3% in emergency patients, and 1.3% in elective patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean bypass time was 174+/-48 (range 90 to 440) minutes and aortic cross clamp time was 132+/-33 (range 64 to 283) minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients undergoing arch replacement, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> was 25+/-17 (range 7 to 99) minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Rethoracotomy for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was required in 4.6% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, there were 20 (7.3%) late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Reoperation of the reconstructed valve was required in 15 patients (5.3%); underlying reasons were <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (n=4) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> (n=11) requiring aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Average grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> increased significantly from 0.23+/-0.46 postoperatively to 0.34+/-0.59 at latest evaluation (P=0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Two patients experienced a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> early postoperatively; no further thromboembolic complications were noticed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients (96%) presented with a favorable exercise tolerance at last contact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The aortic valve reimplantation technique leads to excellent clinical outcome in patients with various pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Lack of anticoagulation and favorable durability should encourage the extension of indications for this technique </plain></SENT>
