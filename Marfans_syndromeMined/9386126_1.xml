<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To ascertain if operative technique has any bearing on outcome, the surgical results after aortic root replacement using either a composite valve graft (CVG) or a separate graft and valve (GV) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Three hundred and ninety consecutive, nonrandomized patients treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic valve disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> (n=278) or type A dissection (n=112 [45 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>]) between 1965 and 1995 were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred and thirty-five patients received a CVG, and 255 had separate GV replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 52+/-16 years (+/-1 SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty-two patients (44% of the CVG group) had the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up (96% complete) totaled 2247 patient-years and extended to 27 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The operative mortality rate was 10+/-3% (+/-70% confidence limits) for patients receiving a CVG and 15+/-2% for GV replacement (P=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 15-year actuarial survival estimate was higher for the CVG group (53+/-14% [+/-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>] versus 36+/-4%, P=.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven patients in the CVG group required reoperation on the aortic valve or ascending aorta, as did 49 in the GV group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The probabilities of freedom from reoperation on the aortic rootwere 82+/-9% and 75+/-4% at 10 years for the CVG and GV group (P=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirty variables were analyzed in a multivariate model: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e>, higher New York Heart Association functional class, and longer cardiopulmonary bypass time were linked with higher operative mortality risk; older age, emergency operation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo> were independent determinants of late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Younger age and use of a bioprosthesis were predictors of late reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Type of procedure (GV versus CVG) was not a significant predictor of any outcome variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The long-term results after CVG or GV were similar, which reflects proper patient selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Use of a composite valve graft theoretically confers more protection against recurrent aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, and, unless one opts for a valve-sparing aortic root replacement procedure, is most appropriate for younger patients, those with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> (including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissections), and others with marked pathological involvement of the sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, use of a separate GV should not be abandoned; in carefully selected patients (and if properly performed, eg, excision of the sinuses), GV also provides satisfactory results </plain></SENT>
