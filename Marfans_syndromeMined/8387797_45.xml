<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nineteen collagen types containing altogether more than 30 distinct <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16541">polypeptide chains</z:chebi> have now been identified, and their genes have been found to be dispersed among at least 12 chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in collagen genes or deficiencies in the activities of specific post-translational enzymes of collagen synthesis have been characterized in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heritable disorders</z:e> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029434" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteogenesis imperfecta</z:e>, several <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodysplasias</z:mp>, several subtypes of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e>, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1567741" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Alport syndrome</z:e> and dystrophic forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">epidermolysis bullosa</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, collagen mutations have been found in certain common diseases, namely <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003560'>osteoarthrosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo>, and it is now evident that subsets of patients with these diseases have defects in types I, II or III collagen, respectively, as a predisposing factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations have so far been identified in only six of the more than 30 collagen genes, and thus research into collagen defects is only in its early stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transgenic mice have been shown to offer an excellent tool for investigating the consequences of mutations in collagen genes and identifying additional diseases caused by collagen defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Excessive collagen accumulation also poses a common problem in medicine, leading to <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> with impairment of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> functioning of the affected tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This has prompted attempts to develop drugs which inhibit collagen synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="26274,32874">Prolyl</z:chebi> 4-hydroxylase would seem a particularly suitable target for antifibrotic therapy, and several compounds are now known that inhibit this enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In particular, derivatives of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46839">pyridine 2,4-dicarboxylate</z:chebi> have been shown to inhibit hepatic collagen accumulation in rats with two models of <z:mp ids='MP_0003333'>liver fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
