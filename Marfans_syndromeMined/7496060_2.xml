<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> are divided into two main groups: those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and those with syndromes involving hereditary defects of the aortic wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The common finding in the setting of both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The biological events that may lead to dissection are a decrease in the holding power of the internal layer, an increase in blood pressure, or an increase in aortic diameter combined with a decrease in wall thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment of established <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection is still associated with a hospital mortality of greater than 10% and long-term complications from persistent blood flow in the distal false lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main therapeutic challenge is to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> by screening of aortic root diameter in patients at risk, together with life-long beta-blockade for Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with suspected dissection, the preference is for rapid noninvasive diagnosis and early surgical repair to reduce the risk of malperfusion and irreversible organ damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results of surgery have improved, with an increasingly conservative approach to repair of the aortic valve with biological glues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Repair is now routinely carried into the aortic arch using improved methods of cerebral protection such as retrograde cerebral perfusion through the superior vena cava </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, there remains scope for further innovation in the prevention and treatment of this difficult problem </plain></SENT>
