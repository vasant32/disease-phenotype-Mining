<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To assess the feasibility and outcome of the valve-sparing aortic root reimplantation technique in patients with severe preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> (AI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Within 8 years we have operated on 158 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta using the reimplantation technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified 83 patients with AI grade 3 or 4 (mean 3.1 +/- 0.4) preoperatively (study group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This cohort was compared with 71 patients with AI grade 2 or less (mean 1.3 +/- 0.9; control group) with regard to mortality, operative variables, complications, need for reoperation, postoperative AI, and clinical presentation during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patient demographics were comparable in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (32% versus 13%, p = 0.006) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (20% versus 8.4%, p = 0.059) were more frequent in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, bypass (177 +/- 60 minutes versus 160 +/- 36 minutes, p = 0.022) and cross clamp times (133 +/- 34 minutes versus 124 +/- 27 minutes, p = 0.049) were significantly longer in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mortality was low in the study group and comparable with controls (30-day, 3.6% versus 4.2%; during follow-up, 3.8% versus 5.9%; p = not significant [NS]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reoperation rate was almost identical in both groups (3.8% versus 4.4%, p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean grade of AI was significantly higher in the study group early postoperatively (0.31 +/- 0.46 versus 0.18 +/- 0.42, p = 0.049) but comparable at the last visit (0.43 +/- 0.58 versus 0.42 +/- 0.62, p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During follow-up neither thromboembolic complications nor <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> events were noted in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Clinical performance at the last visit revealed no significant difference between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> does not impair the excellent outcome seen after a mean of 3 years of follow-up in patients undergoing the reimplantation technique for valve-sparing aortic root reconstruction </plain></SENT>
