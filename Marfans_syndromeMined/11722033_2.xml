<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 65 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (mean age 41.7 +/- 10.7 years, range 15 to 76 years) undergoing ARR between 1972 and 1998 in Southampton were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the patients, 45 had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta and 20 had a type A dissection (16 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The operations were elective in 38 and nonelective in 27 cases (emergency in 22 and urgent in 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean size of the ascending aorta was 6.3 +/- 1.4 cm (3.8 to 12 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A Bentall procedure was performed in 62 and a homograft root replacement in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 8 +/- 4.1 years (0 to 22.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Operative mortality was 6.1% (4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>) (for the elective vs nonelective procedures it was 2.6% vs 11%, p = 0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 10-year freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> was 88%, 89.8%, and 98.4% (0.9%, 0.9%, and 0.2% per patient-year) and from late aortic events it was 86.3% (1.3% per patient-year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aortic root replacement for dissection was an independent predictor of occurrence of late aortic events (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five patients had a reoperation with one early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 10-year freedom from reoperation was 89.2% (1.1% per patient year) (for elective and nonelective procedures, 90.8% vs 84.6%, p = 0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 10-year survival, including operative mortality, was 72.7% (for elective and nonelective procedures, 78% vs 66.5%, p = 0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Late aortic events was an independent adverse predictor of survival (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, elective ARR, usually for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, is associated with a low mortality, low rate of aortic complications, and good late survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Nonelective ARR, mostly for dissection, has a greater operative risk and a significantly higher incidence of late catastrophic aortic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Early prophylactic surgery in these patients is therefore recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Long-term clinical and radiologic follow-up to prevent or to treat late aortic events is highly desirable </plain></SENT>
