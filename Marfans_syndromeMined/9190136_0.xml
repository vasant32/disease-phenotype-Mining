<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No published studies have described the contact lens corrections that can be used with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report describes the variety of contact lens modalities used for a subpopulation of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical records of eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (16 eyes) from two hospital-based contact lens practices were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven different contact lens modalities were used for this subpopulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean unaided visual acuities were 20/296, while mean best-corrected optimal spectacle refraction visual acuities were 20/33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Contact lenses improved the mean visual acuity to 20/27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients wore the contact lenses for an average of 12 hours per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complications of contact lens wear occurred in approximately 70% of eyes and included neovascularization, giant papillary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000509'>conjunctivitis</z:hpo>, 3 and 9 o'clock staining, and central superficial punctate staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, ocular non-contact lens-related complications occurred in 50% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A variety of contact lens designs may be used during the care of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, patients may experience an increased rate of complications associated with contact lens wear or unrelated to lens wear, and thus they deserve more intensive follow-up care than non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
