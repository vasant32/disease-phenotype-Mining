<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This article describes two patients with artificial heart valves who suffered thromboembolytic complications during circulatory assistance using a Biomedicus centrifugal pump </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first case involved a 25-year-old man who presented <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> blockage of a mechanical aortic valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Emergency surgery was performed to replace this valve with a bioprosthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively the patient developed severe left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018801" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart insufficiency</z:e> and a Biomedicus centrifugal pump was placed between the left atrium and the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 3 days of total left ventricular assistance, weaning was started and successfully completed with explanation on the 5th day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two days later the patient died of multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264686" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary embolism</z:e> with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second case involved a 30-year-old man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six months before, he underwent surgical procedure with placement of Bio-prosthesis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002622'>dissecting aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> due to annuloectasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Upon admission for terminal dilated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardiopathy</z:e>, the patient was in <z:mp ids='MP_0003606'>kidney failure</z:mp> almost requiring dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because of this patient's size (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>), no donor heart was immediately available and left circulatory assistance with a Biomedicus pump had to be initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient lived without mechanical ventilation, in good clinical condition until day 23 when he presented <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> due to extensive valvular and coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>From these two cases, several important comments can be made about anticoagulation therapy, partial unloading of left ventricle, or need for biventricular assistance, and efficiency of centrifugal devices in these clinical applications </plain></SENT>
