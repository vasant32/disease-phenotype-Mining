<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Screening of mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene in a Chinese family with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: It has been reported that FBN1 mutations account for approximately 90% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>Autosomal Dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FBN1 mutations were analyzed in a Chinese family of 36 members including 13 MFS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The genomic DNAs from blood leukocytes of the patients and their relatives were isolated and the entire coding region of FBN1 was amplified by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sequence of FBN1 was dertermined with an ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A previously unreported the missense mutation G214S (caused by a 640 Aâ†’G heterozygous change) in FBN1 was identified in the Chinese family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mutation was associated with the disease phenotype in patients, but not detected in their relatives or in the 100 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of molecular characterization of FBN1 in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> family of Chinese origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results expand the spectrum of FBN1 mutations causing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and further confirm the role of FBN1 in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing of the mutation in FBN1 may be used for diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
