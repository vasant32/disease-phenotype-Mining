<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are cysteine-rich <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> predominantly made of multiple repeats homologous to the calcium-binding epidermal growth factor module, and are translated as precursor proteins cleaved by furine/PACE-like activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fibrillins polymerize extracellularly as parallel bundles of head-to-tail monomers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Binding to calcium rigidifies the structure of the monomers and the supramolecular organization of the macroaggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin-1 mutations result in the pleiotropic manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and fibrillin-2 alterations cause the overlapping phenotype of congenital contractural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is hypothesized that fibrillin-2 guides elastogenesis, whereas fibrillin-1 provides force-bearing structural support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gene targeting work in the mouse is shedding new light on their distinct and overlapping contributions to tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is also providing an animal model in which to test therapies aimed at reducing hemodynamic stress and the collapse of the aortic matrix during dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
