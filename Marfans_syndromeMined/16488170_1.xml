<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These mutations often affect the calcium-binding domains, resulting in structural changes to the proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is hypothesized that these Ca+2 binding sites regulate the structure and mechanical properties of the microfibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mechanical properties of fresh and extracted lobster aortic rings in calcium solutions (1, 13 and 30 mM Ca+2) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Samples underwent amino acid compositional analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antibodies were produced against the material comprising extracted aortic rings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ultrastructure of strained and unstrained samples was examined using transmission electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Calcium level altered the tangent modulus of fresh vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These rings were significantly stiffer when tested at 30 mM Ca+2 compared to rings tested at 1 mM Ca+2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Amino acid comparisons between extracted samples, porcine and human fibrillin showed compositional similarity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis showed that antibodies produced against the material in extracted samples localized to the known microfibrillar elements in the lobster aorta and cross-reacted with fibrillin microfibrils of mammalian ciliary zonules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructurally, vessels incubated in low calcium solutions showed diffuse interbead regions while those incubated in physiological or high calcium solutions showed interbead regions with more defined lateral edges </plain></SENT>
