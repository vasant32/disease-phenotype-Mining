<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Calcium binding epidermal growth factor-like domains (cbEGFs) are present in many extracellular proteins, including fibrillin-1, Notch-3, protein S, factor IX and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) receptor, which perform a diverse range of functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic mutations that cause amino acid changes within these proteins have been linked to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>), CADASIL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0684275" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haemophilia</z:e> B and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020445" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">familial hypercholesterolaemia</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A number of these mutations disrupt calcium binding to cbEGFs, emphasising the critical functional role of calcium in these proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have determined the calcium binding affinity of two sites within a cbEGF pair (cbEGF12-13) from human fibrillin-1 using two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and fluorescence techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin-1 is a mosaic protein containing 43 cbEGF domains, mainly arranged as tandem repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results show that the cbEGF13 site in the cbEGF12-13 pair possesses the highest calcium affinity of any cbEGF investigated from fibrillin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A comparative analysis of these and previously reported calcium binding data from fibrillin-1 demonstrate that the affinity of cbEGF13 is enhanced more than 70-fold by the linkage of an N-terminal cbEGF domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, comparison of calcium binding by cbEGF32 in isolation relative to when linked to a transforming growth factor beta-binding protein-like domain (TB6-cbEGF32) reveals that the same enhancement is not observed for this heterologous domain pair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results indicate that fibrillin-1 cbEGF <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> affinity can be significantly modulated by the type of domain which is linked to its N terminus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cbEGF12-13 pair is located within the longest contiguous section of cbEGFs in fibrillin-1, and a number of mutations in this region are associated with the most severe neonatal form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The affinities of cbEGF domains 13 and 14 in this region are substantially higher than in the C-terminal region of fibrillin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This increased affinity may be important for fibrillin assembly into 10-12 nm connective tissue microfibrils and/or may contribute to the biomechanical properties of the microfibrillar network </plain></SENT>
