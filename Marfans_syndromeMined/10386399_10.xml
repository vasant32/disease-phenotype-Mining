<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective study to compare the respective advantages and disadvantages of retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP) and selective cerebral perfusion (SCP) in patients who underwent surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study reviewed 166 patients who underwent surgery at Nagoya University or its eight branch hospitals between January 1990 and August 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 91 patients who received SCP and 75 patients who underwent RCP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results for these two groups were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences in age, gender, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> rate, DeBakey classification, or emergency operation rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rates of various preoperative complications were similar except for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic valve regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Arch replacement was performed more often in SCP than in RCP patients (49% vs. 27%, P = 0.0028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between groups in cardiac ischemic time or visceral organ ischemic time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, RCP group showed shorter cardio-pulmonary bypass time (297+/-99 vs. 269+/-112 min, P = 0.013) and lower the lowest core temperature (21.6+/-3.1 degrees C vs. 18.7+/-2.1 degrees C, P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SCP duration was longer than RCP duration (103+/-56 vs. 54+/-24 min, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite these differences, RCP patients were not significantly different from SCP patients with regard to any postoperative complication, neurological dysfunction (16 vs. 19%), or operative mortality (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> within the hospitalization; 24 vs. 21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Regarding neurologic dysfunction, there were six cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>, six of motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo>, two of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> and one of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> among SCP patients, and eight cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>, three of motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo>, and three of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036572,C0009951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Sign or Symptom" abbrv="">convulsion</z:e> in the RCP group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The incidence of motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> was higher in the SCP group, while the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> was higher in the RCP group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RCP can be performed without clamping or cannulation of the cervical arteries, which is an advantage in reducing the chances of arterial injury or cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>RCP is comparable to SCP in terms of clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
