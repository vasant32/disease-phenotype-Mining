<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The dominant disorder can be caused by mutations in FBN1, at the milder end of the type-1 fibrillinopathies spectrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently in a consanguineous Jordanian family, recessive EL was mapped to locus 1q21 containing the ADAMTSL4 gene and a nonsense mutation was found in exon 11 (c.1785T&gt;G, p.Y595X) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, 36 consecutive probands with EL who did not fulfill the Ghent criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> were screened for mutations in FBN1 and ADAMTSL4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Causative FBN1 mutations were identified in 23/36 (64%) of probands while homozygous or compound heterozygous ADAMTSL4 mutations were identified in 6/12 (50%) of the remaining probands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Where available, familial screening of these families confirmed the mutation co-segregated with the EL phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study confirms that homozygous mutations in ADAMTSL4 are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal-recessive</z:hpo> EL in British families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore; the first compound heterozygous mutation is described resulting in a PTC and a missense mutation in the PLAC (protease and lacunin) domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The identification of a causative mutation in ADAMTSL4 may allow the exclusion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in these families and guide the clinical management, of particular relevance in young children affected by EL </plain></SENT>
