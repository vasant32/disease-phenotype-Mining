<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The best option for repair of descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> (TAAA)-whether open operation or stent grafting-is increasingly a subject of controversy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the results of open surgical repair in patients aged 60 years or younger to assess the value of conventional repair in younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From October 2002 to October 2010, 107 of 294 TAAA operations were in patients (75 men [70%]) aged a mean of 48 Â± 9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients (11%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Operations were elective in 101 (94%); previous aortic operations had been performed in 40 (37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common indication for operation was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection, in 60 (56%); 5 (4.7%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection, and rupture was present in 6 (5.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Descending repair was undertaken in 44 (41%), in 32 (73%) as an elephant trunk stage II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Deep hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> was used in 46 (42.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurologic monitoring and cerebrospinal fluid drainage were routine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median postoperative follow-up was 4.3 years (range, 2 days to 7.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall 30-day mortality was 4.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> occurred in 4 patients (3.7%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> in 1 (0.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The linearized rate for reoperation for TAAA was 0.22/100 patient-years (1 patient in 448.8 patient-years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Survival at 1, 5, and 8 years was 90.5%, 89.4% and 80.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 1 patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos</z:e> died of aortic complications at 4.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although direct comparison with stent grafting is limited by the diversity of patients and indications in published reports, our results suggest that open repair should be the modality of choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Early mortality and neurologic complication rates are similar, if not superior, to endovascular repair for descending aortic and TAAAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Open repair has proven durability and a very low rate of required reintervention, in contrast with endovascular repair </plain></SENT>
