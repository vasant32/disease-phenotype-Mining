<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present here a family with a clinical phenotype resembling <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>), and displaying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>joint contracture</z:hpo> and episodes of knee <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1253936" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">joint effusions</z:e>, but lacking the cardiovascular features of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The phenotype of this family represents a unique mixture of connective tissue symptoms, some of which are found in classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and some of which are typical of dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Linkage analyses suggested a linkage (LOD score 2.4; theta = 0) between the phenotype of the family and a polymorphic marker in the vicinity of the fibrillin locus on chromosome 15 (FBN1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a novel transition mutation was identified in the FBN1 gene in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the affected members of the family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the majority of fibrillin mutations reported so far, this mutation substitutes a cysteine for arginine, producing an extra cysteine in one of the non-calcium-binding EGF-like motifs of the fibrillin <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi>, most probably disturbing the formation of one of the three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bridges known to be essential for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conformation of this motif </plain></SENT>
