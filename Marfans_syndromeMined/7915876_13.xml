<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The major Marfan locus has been identified as the FBN1 gene on chromosome 15; this codes for the extracellular-matrix protein fibrillin, a 350-kD constituent of the 8-10-nm elastin-associated microfibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified five <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients who were heterozygous for an RsaI restriction-site dimorphism in the 3' UTR of the FBN1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This expressed variation was used to distinguish the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> output from each of the two FBN1 alleles in fibroblast cultures from these five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of the patients were shown to produce &lt; 5% of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level of FBN1 transcripts from one of their alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This null-allele phenotype was not observed in 10 nonmarfanoid fibroblast cell lines </plain></SENT>
