<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We evaluated 13 male and 6 female subjects at 14-16 years of age who had undergone ECMO as neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects had a complete physical examination including measurements for height, weight, head circumference, and pubertal assessment by Tanner staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The testicular volume and the phallic length were measured in male participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Laboratory tests included thyroid, liver, and renal function as well as measurements of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> for males, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> for females </plain></SENT>
