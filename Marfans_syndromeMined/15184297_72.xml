<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A group of relatively uncommon but important genetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> (GCVDs) are associated with increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> during exercise, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long-QT syndrome</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These conditions, characterized by diverse phenotypic expression and genetic substrates, account for a substantial proportion of unexpected and usually <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-based fatal events during adolescence and young adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Guidelines are in place governing eligibility and disqualification criteria for competitive athletes with these GCVDs (eg, Bethesda Conference No. 26 and its update as Bethesda Conference No. 36 in 2005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, similar systematic recommendations for the much larger population of patients with GCVD who are not trained athletes, but nevertheless wish to participate in any of a variety of recreational physical activities and sports, have not been available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The practicing clinician is frequently confronted with the dilemma of designing noncompetitive exercise programs for athletes with GCVD after disqualification from competition, as well as for those patients with such conditions who do not aspire to organized sports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indeed, many asymptomatic (or mildly symptomatic) patients with GCVD desire a physically active lifestyle with participation in recreational and leisure-time activities to take advantage of the many documented benefits of exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, to date, no reference document has been available for ascertaining which types of physical activity could be regarded as either prudent or inadvisable in these subgroups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, given this clear and present need, this American Heart Association consensus document was constituted, based largely on the experience and insights of the expert panel, to offer recommendations governing recreational exercise for patients with known GCVDs </plain></SENT>
