<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Here, we examined the development, composition, and structural organization of the ciliary zonule of the mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin 1, a large <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> enriched in force-bearing tissues, is a prominent constituent of the mouse zonule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In humans, mutations in the gene for fibrillin 1 (FBN1) underlie <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (MS), a disorder characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>lens dislocation</z:hpo> and other ocular symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fibrillin expression was analyzed by in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The organization of the zonule was visualized using antibodies to Fbn1, Fbn2, and microfibril-associated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-1 (Magp1) in conjunction with 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30085">ethynyl</z:chebi>-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), an S-phase marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microfibrils, enriched in Fbn2 and Magp1, were prominent components of the temporary vascular tunic of the embryonic lens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fbn2 expression by nonpigmented ciliary epithelial cells diminished postnatally and there was a concomitant increase in Fbn1 expression, especially in cells located in valleys between the ciliary folds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Zonular fibers projected from the posterior pars plicata to the lens in anterior, equatorial, and posterior groupings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The attachment point of the posterior zonular fibers consisted of a dense meshwork of radially oriented microfibrils that we termed the fibrillar girdle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The fibrillar girdle was located directly above the transition zone, a region of the lens epithelium in which cells commit to terminal differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The development and arrangement of the murine ciliary zonule are similar to those of humans, and consequently the mouse eye may be a useful model in which to study ocular complications of MS </plain></SENT>
