<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report heterozygous mutations or deletions in the gene encoding the TGF-β2 ligand for a phenotype within the LDS spectrum and show upregulation of TGF-β signaling in aortic tissue from affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, haploinsufficient Tgfb2(+/-) mice have aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and biochemical evidence of increased canonical and noncanonical TGF-β signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice that harbor both a mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) allele (Fbn1(C1039G/+)) and Tgfb2 haploinsufficiency show increased TGF-β signaling and phenotypic worsening in association with normalization of TGF-β2 expression and high expression of TGF-β1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that compensatory autocrine and/or paracrine events contribute to the pathogenesis of TGF-β-mediated vasculopathies </plain></SENT>
