<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A wide spectrum of operative techniques are applied in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most convey hospital mortality between 10% and 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this high-risk setting, we believe that a conservative approach to the aortic root and the complete resection of the primary tear are important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the results of this policy from our aortic surgery database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1988 and December 2000, 95 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection patients were operated on by one surgeon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They included 70 men and 25 women aged 37 to 81 years (mean 65 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aortic root restoration or replacement was performed during cooling, open arch repair during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e>, and hemostasis while rewarming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighty-seven patients had ascending aortic replacement with glue resuspension of the valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two others had had aortic valve replacement previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Aortic root and partial arch replacement was performed in 6 Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients had hemiarch replacement, and 6 had total arch replacement to excise the tear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five patients died in hospital (5.3% 30-day mortality) and another after early readmission for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mediastinal infection</z:e> (6.3% total mortality) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Two patients required aortic valve replacement for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> 2.5 and 3.0 years postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Two others required total arch replacement and thromboexclusion procedures, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our policy of primary tear excision and preservation of the native aortic valve has resulted in low overall mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>We still prefer to replace the aortic root in dissected Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In this high-risk condition, hospital survival is of paramount importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A conservative "pathology-oriented" approach helps to achieve this aim </plain></SENT>
