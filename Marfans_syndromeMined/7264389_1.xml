<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional echocardiography, RI angiography, CT scan and aortography were performed in 19 patients (12 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, 4 with <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp> syndrome and 3 with postoperative perivalvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight of 12 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> had dissection in the ascending aorta which was confirmed at surgery or autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following observations were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>1) Dissection of the ascending aorta was clearly demonstrated on the two-dimensional echocardiogram in 7 patients by recording the intimal tear and flap, and in these cases the short axis two-dimensional echocardiogram of the ascending aorta was more useful in identifying the site and extent of dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2) In patients with postoperative perivalvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, RI angiography proved to be a more useful and sensitive technique in differentiating a leakage into the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> from clots in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3) CT scanning proved to be an insensitive technique to detect dissection of the ascending <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and to differentiate a leakage from clots in the perivalvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From these observations, we concluded that two-dimensional echocardiography and RI angiography proved to be sensitive techniques in detecting dissection of the ascending <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and evaluating a postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in patients with annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
