<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> (AA) is primarily a disease of older age groups, younger (&lt; 51 years) patients infrequently are admitted requiring AA surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to compare the characteristics of these patients with those of a randomly selected group of older patients with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified 26 patients with AA (group I) under age 51 (mean age 44.8) treated surgically between 1977 and 1993, after excluding patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, traumatic pseudoaneurysms, and ascending or arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and compared them with 75 randomly selected patients with AA between the ages of 65 and 75 (mean age 70.3) who were surgically treated during the same time period (group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, coexisting heart, kidney, or occlusive <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> was similar between the two groups, and familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rates and sex distribution did not differ significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More patients in group I had symptoms at the time of presentation (46% vs 6.7%, p &lt; 0.001), and they also had larger AAs (6.9 cm vs 6.0 cm, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Definable causes of aneurysmal disease, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu</z:e>'s, Cogan's, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndromes</z:e>, were more common among the young patients (23% vs 0%, p = 0.01), but most (77%) young patients did not have an identifiable syndrome associated with their <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group I had a marked shift toward proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, defined as involvement of juxtarenal, suprarenal, or thoracoabdominal aorta (46% vs 18% in group II, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This difference persisted even when <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> associated with the above syndromes were excluded from consideration (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cigarette smoking was much more common among the young patients (83% vs 51% in group II, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Smoking in group II was associated with more extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> disease (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aneurysmal disease presenting in the young adult is more likely to be symptomatic and associated with more proximal aortic involvement than aneurysmal disease in older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Smoking appears to play an important role in the pathogenesis of aneurysmal disease in the young patient and was associated in our study with more proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> among older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A subgroup of patients at risk for early and aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> disease is suggested by these data </plain></SENT>
