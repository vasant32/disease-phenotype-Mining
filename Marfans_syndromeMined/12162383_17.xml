<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess, within a subgroup of a large and clearly defined population of children with disabilities, the impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011968'>feeding difficulties</z:hpo> on (1) the quality (micronutrient intake) and quantity (macronutrient intake) of their diet and (2) their growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred children with disabilities (40 females, 60 males; mean age 9 years, SD 2 years 5 months; range 4 years 6 months to 13 years 7 months) underwent a detailed dietetic analysis and a comprehensive anthropometric assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic categories of disability were: CP (n=90); <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>global developmental delay</z:hpo> (n=3); <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (n=1); <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096063" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intractable epilepsy</z:e> (n=2); <z:hpo ids='HP_0001274'>agenesis of the corpus callosum</z:hpo> (n=2); <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> malonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0012072'>aciduria</z:hpo> (n=1); and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035921" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital rubella</z:e> (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological impairment was classified according to difficulty with mobility which was graded as mild (little or no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002355'>difficulty walking</z:hpo>), moderate (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002355'>difficulty walking</z:hpo> but does not need <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> or a helper), and severe (needs <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> and/or a helper or cannot walk) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results confirmed the significant impact of neurological impairment in children on body growth and nutritional status becoming worse in those with a greater degree of motor impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The major nutritional deficit was in energy intake, with only one fifth reportedly regularly achieving over 100% estimated average requirement (EAR), whilst micronutrient intake was less markedly impaired and protein intake was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in this group (96% above EAR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Many children with neurological impairment would benefit from individual nutritional assessment and management as part of their overall care </plain></SENT>
