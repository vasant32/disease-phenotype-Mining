<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Over the past two decades elective valve-sparing aortic root replacement (V-SARR) has become more common in the treatment of patients with aortic root and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently there are little data available to predict complications in the post-operative population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study goal was to determine if altered flow patterns in the thoracic aorta, as measured by MRI, are associated with complications after V-SARR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Time-resolved three-dimensional phase-contrast MRI (4D flow) was used to image 12 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> after V-SARR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were followed up for an average of 5.8years after imaging and 8.2years after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally 5 volunteers were imaged for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Flow profiles were visualized during peak systole using streamlines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Wall shear stress estimates and normalized flow displacement were evaluated at multiple planes in the thoracic aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the follow-up period, a single patient developed a Stanford Type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At initial imaging, prior to the development of the dissection, the patient had altered flow patterns, wall shear stress estimates, and increased normalized flow displacement in the thoracic aorta in comparison to the remaining V-SARR patients and volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first follow-up study of patients after 4D flow imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> developed in one patient with altered flow patterns and hemodynamic stresses in the thoracic aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that flow and altered hemodynamics may play a role in the development of post-operative intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> and dissections </plain></SENT>
