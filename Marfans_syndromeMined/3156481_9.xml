<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we sought to determine if an inverse relation exists between MVP and LV cavity size on M-mode echocardiograms in 83 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LV end-diastolic dimensions and presence or absence of MVP were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-six patients had MVP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of patients with an LV end-diastolic dimension less than or equal to 5 cm, 90% had MVP; only 19% of the 32 patients with abnormally large (greater than 5.8 cm) end-diastolic dimension had MVP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of MVP in patients with an LV end-diastolic dimension of 5.1 to 5.8 cm was 69% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the prevalence of MVP was inversely related to LV cavity size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To determine whether appearance or disappearance of MVP was associated with decrease or increase in LV cavity size, serial echocardiograms from 67 patients (mean follow-up 42 months, range 3 to 99) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These patients were separated into 3 groups based on changes in the LV end-diastolic dimension of greater than 1 cm over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Group 1 consisted of 9 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had MVP and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LV cavity size on their initial study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With subsequent increase in LV end-diastolic dimension (mean 1.42 +/- 0.3), MVP disappeared in 6 of the 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conversely, group 2 consisted of 4 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had <z:mp ids='MP_0002753'>dilated left ventricles</z:mp> on their initial echocardiogram and no evidence of MVP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After aortic valve replacement, the LV cavity size decreased (mean 2.3 +/- 0.7) and MVP appeared on follow-up studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
