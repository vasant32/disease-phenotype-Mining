<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 29-year-old Japanese female diagnosed as having an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the sinus of Valsalva and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> with no clinical findings of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A modified Bentall's operation was performed successfully, and she was discharged with no complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A pathological examination revealed marked medial mucoid degeneration of the aneurismal wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the literature, most giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> resulting from mucoid degeneration were found in African young adult females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this case, there was much mucoid degeneration in the media with no focal destruction of elastic fibers, which was distinct from cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A careful follow-up will be required to detect any other aneurysmal formation in the future </plain></SENT>
