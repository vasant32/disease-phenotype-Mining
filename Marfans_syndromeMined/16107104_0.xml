<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Extracorporeal circulation was initiated via right subclavian artery cannulation, and the chest was entered through a clamshell incision for the best exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When the patient was cooled to 18 degrees C, the perfusion was stopped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the 1st aortic arch anastomosis to a 30-mm Dacron graft, cerebral perfusion was reestablished via the right subclavian artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aortic repair was then completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cerebral ischemic time was 18 minutes, the aortic cross-clamp time was 69 minutes, and the total extracorporeal circulation time was 334 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 10 with no neurologic impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The arch-first technique shortens the duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When combined with a clamshell incision, the technique is particularly helpful for reoperation of the aortic arch and thoracic aorta </plain></SENT>
