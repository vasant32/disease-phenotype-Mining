<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For young active patients and for patients with "systemic" <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>) who may require future operations, life-long anticoagulation with its attendant thromboembolic versus hemorrhagic risks is not ideal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several techniques have been suggested as aortic valve-sparing options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, a procedure was described that combines the freehand homograft techniques with the standard Bentall techniques (David procedure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This innovative technique replaces the ascending aorta with a Dacron cylinder, spares the aortic valve, and restores competence and thus offers an excellent alternative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The durability of this procedure that places the aortic valve inside a cylindrical conduit without sinuses of Valsalva is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In selected patients, we have used this technique to spare the aortic valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the basis of experimental data and preliminary computer modeling, with the hope of improving the durability, we have modified the conduit to create a "pseudosinus" in our most recent nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We have done the David procedure in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pseudosinus modification was done in the most recent nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients' ages ranged from 37 to 71 years (mean 49.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were five female and five male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Five patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and five patients had annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There has been no mortality and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients have had both early and late follow-up echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Five patients have zero to trace <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo>, four patients have trace to mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo>, and one patient has mild or "1+" <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>Aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> has not progressed in any patient during the 18 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The patient with 1+ <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> has no activity limits, good ventricular function, and no evidence of congestive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>One patient who had extensive thoracoabdominal aneurysmal disease has undergone subsequent replacement of the descending aorta to the level of the renal arteries and has done well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Aortic valve-sparing replacement of the aortic root is an excellent procedure for any patient with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> and an anatomically salvageable valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>We believe that by modifying the proximal conduit and creating a "pseudosinus" into which the leaflets can retract without contact of the cylindrical conduit we may increase the longevity of the native aortic valve in this procedure </plain></SENT>
