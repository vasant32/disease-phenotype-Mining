<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we hypothesized that the impaired contractile function and endothelial-dependent relaxation could be resulted from <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in the thoracic aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adrenergic contraction and cholinergic relaxation of thoracic aortae from mice (n=40; age=3, 6, 9 months) heterozygous for FBN1 allele (Fbn1(C1039G/+)), a well-defined model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, were compared with those from control (n=40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aortic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33023">8-isoprostane</z:chebi> level, an <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> marker, was 32-50% greater in the Marfan group than in the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre-incubation with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) improved the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi>-induced contraction and the sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> in Marfan aortae, but not in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi>-contraction in Marfan aortae was potentiated by 1400 W, an inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) inhibitor, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35634">xanthine oxidase inhibitor</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">Acetylcholine</z:chebi>-induced relaxation was restored by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2781">apocynin</z:chebi>, an inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> oxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Protein expression of SOD-1 and SOD-2 was decreased in Marfan aortae, whereas that of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15318,17712">xanthine</z:chebi> oxidase, iNOS, and the enzymatic subunits of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> oxidase was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The vasomotor dysfunction in Marfan thoracic aortae could be associated with accumulation of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> due to unbalanced protein expression of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi>-producing and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi>-eliminating enzymes </plain></SENT>
