<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study was undertaken to determine whether posterior-only surgery with instrumented fixation and fusion addresses the correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> and maintains curve correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> were treated between 2002 and 2007 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> by posterior segmental instrumentation using pedicle screws or hybrid thoracic-hook and lumbar-screw constructs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their preoperative Cobb angle averaged 66 ± 10° (range: 55-90°) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average operation time was 252 ± 36 min (range: 200-300 min) and the average blood loss was 690 ± 117 ml (range: 550-920 ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant complications were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were followed for a minimum of 2 years (range: 2.4-6.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average Cobb angle was corrected to 23 ± 8° (range: 13-35°) immediately after surgery and 28 ± 9° (range: 14-43°) with a correction rate of 58 ± 13% at final follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that posterior-only surgery with instrumented fixation and fusion is effective and safe for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> in selected patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
