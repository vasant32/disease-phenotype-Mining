<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients aged 13 to 55 with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003306'>rigid spine</z:hpo> deformities were treated by two-stage anterior and posterior vertebral column resection, fusion, and segmental spinal instrumentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the vertebral column resection was to eliminate pain, prevent progressive deformity, and obtain the maximum correction necessary to achieve spinal balance in the coronal and sagittal plane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The final <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> correction averaged 43% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physiologic sagittal alignment was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complications occurred in seven patients (43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is our conclusion, based on this series, that the concept of decancellation, radical vertebral column resection, spinal shortening, and segmental instrumentation posteriorly can achieve a balanced correction and significant pain relief for the select patient who presents with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003306'>rigid spine</z:hpo> deformity not adequately treatable by more established techniques </plain></SENT>
