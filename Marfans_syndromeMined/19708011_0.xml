<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most frequent deformity was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> (n = 42), the asymmetric form of which was observed in 59 % of our patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The strut was left in place for one year and then was removed via a small incision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the exception of two cases of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo>, no other postoperative complications were seen and no patient died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the follow-up 1 year after removal of the Jensen strut, no recurrent deformities were observed in 36 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these results, we consider the described technique as the method of choice in the treatment of congenital thoracic deformities in adult patients </plain></SENT>
