<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A single clinical evaluation, using a standardized protocol, of randomly selected out-patients was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001382'>Joint hypermobility</z:hpo> was measured by two scales in wide clinical use (Beighton and Contompasis), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000974'>skin hyperextensibility</z:hpo> was assessed on the dorsum of the hand, and skin thickness and light transmissibility was measured at the same site with a modified Harpenden caliper </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The setting was an out-patient medical genetics clinic at an urban teaching hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The subjects comprised 27 children and 48 adults who met strict diagnostic criteria for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients less than 18 yr old, 70% had experienced at least one locomotor syndrome, and 40% had had multiple symptoms, of which <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003326'>myalgia</z:hpo> and ligamentous injury were the most frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Symptoms were absent in children younger than 5 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, the number of symptoms increased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Considerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001382'>joint hyperextensibility</z:hpo> (&gt; 3/9 of Beighton's criteria) was present in 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While one-third had received orthopaedic attention, there had been little if any rheumatological input </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In adult patients, locomotor symptoms had occurred in 96%, with 88% having experienced more than one complaint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Spinal pain, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo>, ligament injury and fracture were the most common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most (81%) of the adults had some (&gt; 1/9), and 56% had considerable (&gt; 2/9) evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001382'>joint hypermobility</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Only 20% had received specialist attention for their locomotor symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Skin changes are documented in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> for the first time in this study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
