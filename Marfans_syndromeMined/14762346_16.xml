<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients and methods Between March 1979 and April 2002, 119 patients with clinical evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> underwent composite graft replacement with mechanical valve conduits (n = 74) or aortic valve-sparing reimplantation according to David (n = 45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The underlying causes were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> type A (43 patients) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (76 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients undergoing aortic valve reimplantation were younger compared with patients undergoing composite grafting (28 vs 35 years, P =.002) and had longer intraoperative aortic crossclamp times (125 vs 78 minutes, P &lt;.0001) and extracorporeal circulation times (162 vs 124 minutes, P &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early postoperative mortality was 6.8% (n = 5) in patients undergoing composite grafting and 0% in patients undergoing aortic valve reimplantation (P =.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 30 months for patients undergoing aortic valve reimplantation and 114 months for patients undergoing composite grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Freedom from reoperation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after 5 years postoperatively was 92% and 89% in patients undergoing composite grafting and 84% and 96% in patients undergoing aortic valve reimplantation (P =.31; P =.54), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thromboembolic complications or late postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> occurred in 17 patients undergoing composite grafting, and an early postoperative event occurred in 1 patient undergoing aortic valve reimplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of aortic valve reimplantation and composite grafting of the aortic valve and ascending aorta with mechanical valve conduits are similar with regard to early and mid-term postoperative mortality and to the incidence of late reoperations in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The low risk of thromboembolic or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications favors aortic valve reimplantation in these patients </plain></SENT>
