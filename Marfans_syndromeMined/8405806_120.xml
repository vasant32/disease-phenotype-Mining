<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The elastic properties of many tissues such as the lung, dermis, and large blood vessels are due to the presence of elastic fibers in the extracellular space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These fibers have been shown by biochemical and ultrastructural analysis to be composed of two distinct components, a more abundant amorphous component and a 10-12 nm microfibrillar component, which is located primarily around the periphery of the amorphous component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The protein elastin makes up the highly insoluble amorphous component and is responsible for the elastic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Elastin is found throughout the vertebrate kingdom and possesses an unusual chemical composition rich in glycine, proline, and hydrophobic amino acids, consonant with its characteristic physical properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 72-kDa biosynthetic precursor, tropoelastin, is secreted into the extracellular space where it becomes highly cross-linked into a rubber-like network through the activity of the copper-requiring enzyme <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32568">lysyl</z:chebi> oxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the elastin gene has demonstrated that hydrophobic and cross-linking domains are encoded in separate exons and that there is significant alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms of tropoelastin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The elastin gene promoter contains many potential binding sites for various modulating factors indicative of a complex pattern of transcriptional regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The microfibrils contain several proteins, including fibrillin, and probably act as an organizing scaffold in the formation of the elastin network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There appears to be a fibrillin gene family in which each protein contains multiple repeats of a motif previously found in epidermal growth factor and a second motif observed in transforming growth factor beta 1-binding protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the fibrillin gene located on human chromosome 15 have been strongly implicated as the cause of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
