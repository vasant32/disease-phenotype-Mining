<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The type of horizontal deviation found at the initial examinations was distributed equally between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000565'>esotropia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000577'>exotropia</z:hpo> in the unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000519'>congenital cataracts</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity results in the various groups followed perhaps the expected trends with the poorest results in the unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000519'>congenital cataract</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those patients in the acquired groups have better visual results with 56% of the traumatic and 83% of the non-traumatic eyes achieving vision of 20/70 or better </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite the high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000486'>strabismus</z:hpo> present in these patients, we feel this should in no way be a deterent to the decision to initiate therapy as it does not seem to relate to visual acuity results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall good visual results in these patients justifies the approach of early surgery, adequate correction, and vigorous occlusion </plain></SENT>
