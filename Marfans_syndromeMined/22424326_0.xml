<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the evolution of surgical management in a large population of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients fulfilling the Ghent criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, who visited the Centre de référence national pour le syndrome de Marfan et apparentés and underwent a surgical event before or during follow-up in the centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One thousand and ninety-seven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, according to international criteria, came to the clinic between 1996 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aortic surgery was performed in 249 patients (22.7%; 20 children and 229 adults), including the Bentall procedure in 140 patients (56%) and valve-sparing surgery in 88 patients (35%); a supracoronary graft was performed in 19 patients (7.6%), usually for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the past 20 years, the predominant reason for aortic surgery has switched from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo>, while age at surgery has tended to increase (from 32.4 ± 11.9 years to 35.2 ± 12.4 years; P=0.075) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mitral valve surgery was performed in 61 patients (5.6%; six children and 55 adults), including 37 valvuloplasties (60.6%) and 18 mitral valve replacements (29.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed when comparing mitral valve surgery before and after 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Surgery performed in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> has switched from emergency surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> to elective surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo>; this is associated with surgery performed at an older age despite the indication for surgery having decreased from 60mm to 50mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant evolution was observed for mitral valve surgery </plain></SENT>
