<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Even less information is available about the early treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> at age &lt; 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Purpose of this case report is to demonstrate the possibility of successful brace treatment in a patient with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: A two year old girl diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> presented with a double major <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> of 20° </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a follow-up of 6 months she showed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> to 46° (November 2008) and was braced immediately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In-brace correction in the first Chêneau brace (RSC TM) was moderate due to the stiffness mainly of the lumbar curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A new brace was made after significant growth (Gensingen braceTM in October 2009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An in-brace correction to 12° thoracic and 12° lumbar has been achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In October 2010 she also has outgrown her second brace to some extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Due to clinical overcorrection (ATR lumbar -5°) brace wearing time has been reduced to 12 hrs. / day at first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In January 2011 at the age of 4 and a half she presented again with an ATR lumbar of -6° still overcorrected clinically, so we decided to leave off the brace for 3 months time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The deformity returned and we had to make a new brace in April 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For brace construction a new x-ray has been made showing the curve meanwhile has been reduced to 24° Cobb, however still with significant wedging of the apical vertebra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: (1) Successful brace treatment in infantile / juvenile patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> is possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>(2) When treated during periods of rapid growth corrections can be achieved with high correction braces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>(3) Before early surgery is performed high quality conservative management seems indicated </plain></SENT>
