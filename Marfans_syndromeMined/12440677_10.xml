<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred eighty-nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> managed over a 36-year period were analyzed retrospectively for three outcome endpoints: survival; freedom from reoperation, and freedom from late aortic-related complications or late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were identified using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then to account for patient selection bias, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the population, and continuous evolution in techniques, propensity score analysis was used to identify risk-matched cohorts (quintiles I and II) in which the results of medical (n = 111) or surgical (n = 31) therapy were compared more comprehensively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The two main determinants of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were shock (hazard ratio [HR] = 14.5, 95% confidence level [CL] 4.7, 44.5; p &lt; 0.001) and visceral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (HR = 10.9, 95% CL 3.9, 30.3; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arch involvement, rupture, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, previous sternotomy, and coronary or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lung disease</z:e> roughly doubled the hazard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Female sex was also a significant but weaker independent predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival estimates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were 71%, 60%, 35%, and 17% at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively, and were similar for the medical and surgical patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> predicted reoperation and late aortic complications or late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a separate analysis of the 142 patients in quintiles I and II, survival, freedom from reoperation, as well as freedom from late aortic complications or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were almost identical in the medical and surgical subsets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The poor long-term prognosis of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> is determined primarily by dissection-related and patient-specific risk factors, which are not readily modifiable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Whether the outlook in the future will be improved using stent-grafts remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
