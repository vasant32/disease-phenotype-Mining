<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, 24 had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> only, and three had transverse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003496" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic rupture</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixteen had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>; 17 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>; and in eight there were other causal factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 17 the cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histological examination did not help to establish the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography failed to detect dissection of the ascending aorta in four (21%) out of 19 cases studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate in the whole series was 26% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early (operative and hospital) and late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred in 20% and 6% of patients respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The early mortality rate was 40% in the 24 emergency cases of dissection of the ascending aorta, 9% in patients operated on for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the ascending and transverse aorta without dissection, and 8% in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection of the ascending aorta who had elective operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Early and late mortality rates were no higher in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's disease</z:e> than in any of the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that contrast enhanced computer tomography should be performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with pronounced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> and in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's disease</z:e> with symptoms which suggest dissection, even if they have only slight <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Preventive replacement of the ascending aorta should be considered in more patients to reduce the number of emergency operations, in which the mortality rate is high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There is no definite limit of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> above which preventive replacement of the ascending aorta should be routinely considered </plain></SENT>
