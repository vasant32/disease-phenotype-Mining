<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the sensitivity and specificity of fibrillin protein abnormalities in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, we studied dermal fibroblasts from 57 patients with classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, 15 with equivocal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, 8 with single-organ manifestations, and 16 with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Abnormal fibrillin metabolism was identified in 70 samples that were classified into four different groups based on quantitation of fibrillin synthesis and matrix deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations were found for phenotypic features including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001065'>striae distensae</z:hpo>, cardiovascular manifestations, and fibrillin groups II and IV, which included 70% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, these two groups were associated with shortened "event-free" survival and more severe cardiovascular complications than groups I and III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latter included most of the equivocal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>/single manifestation patients with fibrillin abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that fibrillin defects at the protein level per se are not specific for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, but that the drastically reduced fibrillin deposition, caused by a dominant-negative effect of abnormal fibrillin molecules in individuals defined as groups II and IV, is of prognostic and possibly diagnostic significance </plain></SENT>
