<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study are to emphasize important medical considerations that influence the choice of surgical treatment of spinal deformity in patients with exotic congenital syndromes and point out preoperative strategies that reduce treatment morbidity and mortality of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Individual experience is limited in the treatment of spine abnormality in rare exotic syndromes and the medical aspects of these syndromes that may impact spinal treatment are seldom discussed in detail in the orthopedic literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For a successful outcome in the treatment of spinal deformity in these unique patients, a working knowledge of the unique pitfalls in their medical care is necessary in order to avoid morbidity and mortality during their treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The literature was reviewed for 6 exotic congenital syndromes with known or unreported spinal abnormalities and the author's personal 22-years experience of the treatment of thoracic insufficiency syndrome in the relevant congenital syndromes was summarized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and spinal deformity may have serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous dissection of the aortic root is a clear danger and patients should be monitored by serial echocardiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic cardiac surgery may be necessary before spinal surgery is to be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265275" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Jeune syndrome</z:e> have a high rate of proximal cervical stenosis and should undergo screening with cervical spine films at birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant stenosis or instability may require decompression and cervical-occipital fusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002804'>Arthrogryposis</z:hpo> may be associated with a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> and jaw <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contracture</z:hpo> may make intubation difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175778" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Larsen syndrome</z:e> may have early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> that is very rigid and requires early intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002947'>Cervical kyphosis</z:hpo> and subluxation may be lethal in these patients and screening radiographs are important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Upper airway abnormalities are an anesthesia concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Jarcho-Levin syndrome</z:e> is a thoracic volume <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> deformity due to shortness of the thorax, either a spondylocostal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013393" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dysostosis</z:e> variant or spondylothoracic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The former has a chaotic congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> with varied combination of missing and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000902'>fused ribs</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Although spondylocostal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013393" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dysostosis</z:e> has a benign reputation in the literature for respiratory complications, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory insufficiency</z:hpo> is nevertheless common and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is known from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Spondylothoracic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> seldom has significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, but has a mortality rate approaching 50% from respiratory complications due to thoracic insufficiency syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In spite of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002111'>restrictive respiratory disease</z:hpo>, adult survivors of spondylothoracic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> appear to do well clinically for unknown reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265342" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CCMS">Cerebrocostomandibular syndrome</z:e> has <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000347'>micrognathia</z:hpo>, and thoracic insufficiency syndrome, due to an "implosion" deformity of the thorax from congenital pseudarthrosis of the posterior ribs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: For optimal patient care, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of exotic congenital syndromes and how they may impact on both the presentation of spinal deformity and the response to treatment, as well as how they may introduce additional morbidity into standard treatment plans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>It is clear that with this understanding that preoperative strategies can be employed to enhance the safety of spinal treatment for these unique children </plain></SENT>
