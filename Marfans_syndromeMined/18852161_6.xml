<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>Aortic dilatation</z:hpo> and dissection are life threatening manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and case reports have suggested a possible association with OSA but data from cohort studies are not available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A sleep study was performed in 61 patients with Ghent criteria positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (mean age 38.3 (SD 12.9) years; 37 females) and in 26 control subjects matched for age, gender, height and weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OSA was defined using two conventional levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnoea</z:hpo>-hypopnoea index (AHI), &gt;5 and &gt;15/h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, aortic root diameter was measured by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: More patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> than controls had OSA (AHI &gt;5, 32.8% compared with 11.5%, mean difference +21.3%, 95% CI 4.2% to 38.3%, p = 0.04; AHI &gt;15, 18.0% compared with 0%, mean difference +18.0%, 95% CI 8.4% to 27.7%, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AHI was correlated with aortic root diameter (r = 0.50, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.69, p = 0.0003), and mean aortic root diameter was significantly greater in patients with OSA (4.5 (SD 0.6) cm) compared with those without OSA (3.7 (0.6) cm) (mean difference 0.8 cm, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.2 cm, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, the prevalence of OSA is considerably higher than in matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>OSA may be a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
