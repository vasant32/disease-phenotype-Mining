<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Binding to this sequence was demonstrated for full-length MAGP-1 as well as for the MAGP-1 matrix-binding domain encoded by exons 7 and 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The matrix-binding domain, but not the full-length protein, also bound to regions of fibrillin-2 defined by exons 16 and 17, exon 20, and exons 23 and 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, no binding was detected to sequences near the N or C terminus where MAGP-1 and MAGP-2, respectively, were shown to interact with fibrillin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The localization of MAGP-1 binding to the 8-Cys domain encoded by exon 24 suggests that the bead structure of microfibrils consists of exon 24 and portions of the central region of fibrillin-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exon 24 in fibrillin lies in the region of the molecule where mutations produce the most severe phenotypes associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (fibrillin-1) and congenital contractural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo> (fibrillin-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is possible that these mutations alter the ability of fibrillin to bind MAGP-1, which may contribute to the severity of the disease </plain></SENT>
