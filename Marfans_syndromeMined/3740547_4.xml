<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The serum beta-glucuronidase levels in the patients ranged from 294 to 439 micrograms (360.7 +/- 73.2, mean +/- SD) of the released P-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="39362">nitrophenol</z:chebi>/100 ml of serum/hour, whereas those of 7 healthy subjects ranged from 564 to 1445 micrograms (836.4 +/- 287.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycan</z:chebi> levels in the patients were lower than those in the healthy subjects, owing mainly to the differences in plasma high-sulfated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correlation coefficients of serum beta-glucuronidase activity with high-sulfated and total plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycans</z:chebi> were 0.794 and 0.809, respectively (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the decreased plasma high-sulfated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycan</z:chebi> levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> are due to the reduction of serum beta-glucuronidase, which leads to the decreased degradation of macromolecules and, subsequently, the accumulation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycans</z:chebi> in the tissues </plain></SENT>
