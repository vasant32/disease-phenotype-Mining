<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study reviews the surgical outcome of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who underwent extensive aortic reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Extensive reconstruction is defined as reconstruction of more than two segments of the ascending, arch, descending thoracic, or abdominal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From March 1973 to December 1997, 101 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> underwent aortic operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients (25.7%) had extensive aortic reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 26 patients suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>: 13 patients had Stanford type A and 13 had type B dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients (88.4%) had annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgical procedures included composite valve graft replacement (n = 23, 88.4%), aortic arch reconstruction (n = 15, 57.7%), graft replacement of the descending thoracic aorta (n = 6, 23.1%), and graft replacement of the thoracoabdominal aorta (n = 16, 61.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five patients (19.2%) had total thoracoabdominal aortic replacement, and three patients (11.5%) had replacement of the entire aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients (80.8%) required multiple operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Follow-up was complete in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 30-day survival rate was 88.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>None of the survivors had <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002385'>paraparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The overall long-term survival rate was 88.5 +/- 6% at 1 year, and 81.7 +/- 9% at 9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aortic surgery prolongs survival in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and currently there is a relatively low associated morbidity and mortality even for aggressive surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
