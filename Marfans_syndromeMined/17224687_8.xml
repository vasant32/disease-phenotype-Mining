<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic testing for these disorders is labor-intensive and expensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to develop a more rapid, comprehensive, and cost-effective approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Paired whole blood samples were collected into tubes with or without an <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-preserving solution, and harvested for whole blood <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> or leukocyte DNA, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Large overlapping cDNA fragments from KCNQ1 and KCNH2 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>Long QT Syndrome</z:hpo>), MYBPC3 (hypertrophic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>), or FBN1 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan Syndrome</z:e>) were amplified from <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and directly sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Variants were confirmed in leukocyte DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 4 transcripts were amplified and sequenced from whole blood <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six known and 2 novel mutations were first identified from <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> of 10 probands, and later confirmed in genomic DNA, at considerable savings in time and cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In one patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> sequencing directly identified a splicing mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results from <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and DNA were concordant for single nucleotide polymorphisms at the same loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Taking advantage of new whole blood <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> stabilization methods, we have designed a cost-effective, comprehensive method for mutation detection that should significantly facilitate clinical genetic testing in four lethal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
