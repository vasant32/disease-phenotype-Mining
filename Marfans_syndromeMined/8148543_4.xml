<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean age at presentation was 5.7 months (range 4 to 9 months) in the infant group (n = 3), and 13.3 years (range 10 to 16 years) in a group of older children (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary indications for surgery in the infant group (performed at a mean of 3 years after diagnosis) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> with valvar regurgitation in one patient, and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> with regurgitation in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the older group, surgical indications (performed at a mean of 2.8 years after diagnosis) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> with valvar regurgitation in three patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For aortic surgery, a composite valved conduit was used in four patients, and an aortic homograft in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For mitral valve surgery, mechanical prostheses were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients survived the primary operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Over a mean follow-up of 17.5 patient-years (range 1 to 9 years), two patients in the infant Marfan group went on to further successful surgery (prosthetic mitral valve replacement and aortic root repair with aortic homograft) at a mean interval of 4.3 years after the initial surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in the young, even in those diagnosed during infancy, have been favorably changed by surgery with an encouraging medium-term outlook </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The correct timing of surgery is aided by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
