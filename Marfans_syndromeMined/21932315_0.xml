<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on eight patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> presenting initially with bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> (EL) during early childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These individuals did not have systemic manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, and did not fulfill the revised Ghent diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had demonstratable, disease-causing missense mutations in the FBN1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on molecular results, cardiovascular imaging was recommended and led to the identification of mild aortic root changes in seven of the eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearing thoracic aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings presented in this paper validate the necessity of FBN1 gene testing in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals presenting with isolated EL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As we observed, these individuals are at increased risk of cardiovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we also noted that the majority of our patient cohort's mutations occurred in the 5' portion of the FBN1 gene, and were found to affect highly conserved <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32460">cysteine residues</z:chebi>, which may indicate a possible genotype-phenotype correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in patients with isolated features of EL, FBN1 mutation analysis is necessary to aid in providing prompt diagnosis, and to identify patients at risk for potentially life-threatening complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, knowledge of the type and location of an FBN1 mutation may be useful in providing further clinical correlation regarding phenotypic progression and appropriate medical management </plain></SENT>
