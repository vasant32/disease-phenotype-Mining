<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent reports have described a distinct and recurrent pattern of systemic malformation that associates <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> and neurodevelopmental abnormalities with many clinical features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>), an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> disorder of the extracellular microfibril caused by defects in the gene encoding fibrillin-1, FBN1 (ref </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additional common findings include other craniofacial anomalies, <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp>, obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001760'>foot deformity</z:hpo>, and congenital <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of the abdominal wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>So far, only 11 cases have been reported precluding the assignment of definitive diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While it remains unclear whether these cases represent a discrete clinical entity with a single aetiology, they have been pragmatically grouped under the rubric Marfanoid-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1321551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome</z:e> (SGS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because of the significant clinical overlap between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and SGS, we proposed that they may be caused by allelic mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We now report two SGS patients who harbour mutations in FBN1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While it remains unclear whether these mutations are sufficient for the clinical expression of the entire SGS phenotype, these data suggest a role for fibrillin-1 in early craniofacial and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our recent observation that FBN1 transcript is expressed as early as the 8-cell stage of human embryogenesis is consistent with this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
