<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The stability of a polymeric collagen fraction, extracted from the skin of these patients, to depolymerization, has been compared with that from thirty-one matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean polymeric collagen stability was significantly reduced (P less than 0-01) in the group of fifteen patients with idiopathic adolescent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The individual reductions in stability were greater in the younger patients and no reduction was found in two patients aged 19 years who had a mature skeleton </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean stability of polymeric skin collagen from the group of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> was not significantly abnormal, although there were individual low values </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Polymeric collagen of low stability was present in individual patients from each clinical group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Instability of collagen (from whatever cause) at a time of rapid growth may contribute to the high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> in adolescent girls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In boys, adolescent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> is less common and the maximum growth rate occurs at a time when collagen stability is less reduced </plain></SENT>
