<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: The aetiopathogenesis of spontaneous cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissection</z:e> (sCAD) is largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopic (EM) examination of skin biopsies of patients with sCAD revealed very subtle pathological changes of dermal connective tissue in about half of these patients leading to the hypothesis of an underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, connective tissue abnormalities did not allow clear discrimination between patients and controls in our hands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we sought to establish an objective basis for the assessment of connective tissue abnormalities in patients with sCAD using standardised morphometric assessment of collagen fibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study a blinded examination was performed of collagen in skin biopsies and it sought parameters which are able to discriminate between patients with sCAD and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Various morphometric parameters were compared between patients with sCAD (n = 20) and control subjects (n = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Previously described "flower-like" collagen fibrils in skin biopsies were extremely rare in patients and controls and did not discriminate between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, they were abundant in the skin biopsy of a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268337" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="EDS3">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type III</z:e> (EDSIII) used as a reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Morphometric parameters such as collagen fibril diameter, fibril density and relative fibril area did not discriminate between patients and controls on an individual basis, but the mean diameter of collagen fibrils in the skin was lower in patients with sCAD compared with controls while fibril density was higher resulting in nearly equal fibril areas per unit of area (relative fibril area) comparing both groups as well as individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Blinded pathological and morphometric analysis of collagen fibres in skin biopsies was, in our hands, unable to discriminate reliably between patients with sCAD and controls on an individual basis but did show differences in collagen fibril morphometry on a group basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, systematic and blinded pathological studies of skin biopsies in patients with sCAD and controls are needed </plain></SENT>
