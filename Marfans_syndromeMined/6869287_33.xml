<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 10 females and 5 males were diagnosed at a mean age of 18 months (range 2 days to 3.5 years); 13 were followed up for a mean of 45 months (range 8 to 109 months) and 2 were lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On first evaluation, 5 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) and none had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> (AR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> in 9 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> (MVP) in 9; only 2 patients had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> echocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At follow-up examination, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo>; the rate of increase in aortic root diameter was generally greater than predicted on the basis of body surface area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient had AR at age 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 13 patients had MVP; 9 had progressive mitral valve dysfunction and 4 had mitral valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient died immediately postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> is usually present in early childhood and serves as an objective indicator of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MVP is common and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>, which may require valve replacement, is the leading cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> in childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography is useful in the diagnosis and routine management of infants and children in whom the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is suspected </plain></SENT>
