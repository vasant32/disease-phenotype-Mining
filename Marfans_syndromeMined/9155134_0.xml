<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aortic valves were observed as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> configuration in both cases and then reimplanted within the synthetic grafts along with the David's procedure </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aortic valve preserving operation for annulo-aortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> was considered much effective in cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in order to expect the thrombolization in the pseudo lumen </plain></SENT>
