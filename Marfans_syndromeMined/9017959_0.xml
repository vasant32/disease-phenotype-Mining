<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We herein review our 17-year surgical experience for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> to clarify the risks of increased mortality and reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects consisted of 15 patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> undergone surgery for the aortic root and ascending aorta at Niigata University Hospital between July 1978 and January 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aortic valve replacement and ascending aortic wrapping were performed in 5 patients, Bentall or Cabrol operation in 6, and combined aortic arch reconstruction and Cabrol operation in 2, as the initial surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (Stanford type A) at initial surgery were assigned to group I (n = 7), while those with an aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> were assigned to group II (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In group I, 3 patients required a second operation for the remaining aortic arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, and 1 died due to a late rupture of the distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In group II, no patient needed a reoperation; however, 1 died due to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> and another due to composite valve graft failure and distal dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results thus indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> seems to affect long-term outcome, and therefore the combined repair of the aortic root and transverse arch is recommended in Marfan patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> involving the transverse aortic arch </plain></SENT>
