<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the pharmacokinetics of atenolol in 13 such patients aged 18.7 +/- 2.9 years who were receiving 1.78 +/- 0.58 mg/kg/day (70.1 +/- 20.3 mg/m2/day) of atenolol for 6 weeks or longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean +/- SD percentage change in baseline heart rate after the administration of atenolol was -18.03 +/- 16.59% and mean +/- SD percentage change in exercise heart rate after atenolol was -33.22 +/- 14.75% (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six to 8 atenolol serum concentrations were collected in each patient during a 12-hour dosing interval and were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum atenolol concentrations at 0 (123 +/- 70 micrograms/L) and 12 (116 +/- 66 micrograms/L) hours were within 20% of each other and were thus assumed to be at steady-state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A one-compartment, steady-state pharmacokinetic model with first-order absorption and elimination was fitted to the concentration-time data for each patient using nonlinear regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maximal concentration was 343 +/- 120 micrograms/L, and the mean half-life was 4.72 hours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
