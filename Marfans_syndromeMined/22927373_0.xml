<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ability to target collagens undergoing remodeling could lead to new diagnostics and therapeutics as well as applications in regenerative medicine; however, such collagens are often degraded and denatured, making them difficult to target with conventional approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we present caged collagen mimetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMPs</z:chebi>) that can be photo-triggered to fold into triple helix and bind to collagens denatured by heat or by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">Peptide</z:chebi>-binding assays indicate that the binding is primarily driven by stereo-selective triple-helical hybridization between monomeric <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMPs</z:chebi> of high triple-helical propensity and denatured collagen strands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Photo-triggered hybridization allows specific staining of collagen chains in protein gels as well as photo-patterning of collagen and gelatin substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo experiments demonstrate that systemically delivered <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMPs</z:chebi> can bind to collagens in bones, as well as prominently in articular cartilages and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> characterized by high MMP activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We further show that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi>-based probes can detect abnormal bone growth activity in a mouse model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is an entirely new way to target the microenvironment of abnormal tissues and could lead to new opportunities for management of numerous pathologic conditions associated with collagen remodeling and high MMP activity </plain></SENT>
