<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The David reimplantation procedure is the preferred method of preserving tricuspid aortic valves during aortic root replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the results of a simplified approach to the David valve-sparing root reimplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 234 patients who underwent David reimplantation or some modification thereof, 129 operated on from January 2001 to June 2008 formed a consecutive single-surgeon series for midterm evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aortic anulus-left ventricular outflow tract and proximal tube graft size were reduced over a Hegar dilator to mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diameter based on body surface area, in the process creating neo-sinuses to accommodate cusp opening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one patients (47%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean body surface area was 2.1 +/- 0.27 m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> grade was 1+ or less in 46%, 2+ in 26%, 3+ in 24%, and 4+ in 4.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Left ventricular outflow tract sizing by Hegar dilator was 17 mm in 9.5% of patients, 19 mm in 18%, 21 mm in 56%, and 23 mm in 16% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five (43%) had concomitant cusp repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> grade was 0 in 98%, and none of the remaining had greater than 2+ AR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postoperative mean aortic gradient was 9.0 +/- 3.5 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No patient had intraoperative abandonment of the repair, and there were no postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Five-year survival was 99%, and 4 patients (3%) required late valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A simple modification of the David operation, reducing anular size, and creating neo-sinuses preserves the aortic valve, eliminates <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, avoids <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo>, and has favorable midterm results </plain></SENT>
