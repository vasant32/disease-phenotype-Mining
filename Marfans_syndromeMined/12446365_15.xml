<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>), inherited as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> trait, typically affects the cardiovascular, skeletal, and ocular systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>Ectopia lentis</z:hpo> (EL) is a clinical manifestation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, with stretching or disruption of the lenticular zonular filaments, leading to displacement of the lenses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EL, with or without minor skeletal changes, exists as an independent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> phenotype linked to the same FBN1 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A consecutive series of 11 patients, affected predominantly by EL, was analysed for FBN1 mutations using PCR, SSCA, and sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six mutations were identified, of which three are novel and one is recurrent in two patients, thus establishing a mutation incidence in this group of 7/11 (63%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The FBN1 variants reported are clustered in the first 15 exons of the gene, while FBN1 mutations reported in the literature are distributed throughout the entire length of the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A different type of FBN1 mutation presents in this group of patients, compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, with arginine to cysteine substitutions appearing frequently </plain></SENT>
