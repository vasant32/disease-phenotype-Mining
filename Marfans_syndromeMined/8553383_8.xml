<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In several publications and neurological textbooks, a relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> has been assumed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The records of 135 patients classified as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who visited the Amsterdam Marfan clinic or were admitted to the departments of neurology and neurosurgery and the records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> who visited or were admitted to the departments of neurology and neurosurgery between January 1, 1982, and January 1, 1994, were retrieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The literature was reviewed regarding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No patient visiting the Marfan clinic had a symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> had been admitted with a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> at the departments of neurology or neurosurgery in this period, while during that period 826 patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> had been admitted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During follow-up of 129 of the 135 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (2850 retrospective patient observation years and 581 prospective patient observation years), none presented a symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The suggested relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> is based mainly on 10 case reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is doubtful in several of these reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Several large studies of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> did not mention a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> as a clinical manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that there is insufficient evidence to presume a relationship between symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> on the basis of currently available data </plain></SENT>
