<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Growth factors of the transforming growth factor-beta family are potent regulators of the extracellular matrix formation, in addition to their immunomodulatory and regulatory roles for cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TGF-beta s are secreted from cells as latent complexes containing TGF-beta and its propeptide, LAP (latency-associated <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In most cells LAP is covalently linked to an additional protein, latent TGF-beta binding protein (LTBP), forming the large latent complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LTBPs are required for efficient secretion and correct folding of TGF-beta s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The secreted large latent complexes associate covalently with the extracellular matrix via the N-termini of the LTBPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LTBPs belong to the fibrillin-LTBP family of extracellular matrix proteins, which have a typical repeated domain structure consisting mostly of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats and characteristic eight cysteine (8-Cys) repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Currently four different LTBPs and two fibrillins have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LTBPs contain multiple proteinase sensitive sites, providing means to solubilize the large latent complex from the extracellular matrix structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LTBPs are now known to exist both as soluble molecules and in association with the extracellular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An important consequence of this is LTBP-mediated deposition and targeting of latent, activatable TGF-beta into extracellular matrices and connective tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LTBPs have a dual function, they are required both for the secretion of the small latent TGF-beta complex as well as directing bound latent TGF-beta to extracellular matrix microfibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, it is not known at present whether LTBPs are capable of forming microfibrils independently, or whether they are a part of the fibrillin-containing fibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most LTBPs possess RGD-sequences, which may have a role in their interactions with the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At least LTBP-1 is chemotactic to smooth muscle cells, and is involved in vascular remodelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Analyses of the expressed LTBPs have revealed considerable variations throughout the molecules, generated both by alternative splicing and utilization of multiple promoter regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The significance of this structural diversity is mostly unclear at present </plain></SENT>
