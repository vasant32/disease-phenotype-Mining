<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Marked differences in amino acid analyses and susceptibilities to pancreatic elastase were observed between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathological samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incorporation of either <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-lysine or <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">glucosamine</z:chebi> into proteins of the vessel wall was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, high amounts of elastase-type activity was extractable from pathological aorta specimens which may contribute significantly to the loss of elastic tissue evidenced by ultra-structural studies and confirmed by the biochemical technics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We propose therefore that increased elastase-type protease activity in these pathological aortas does significantly contribute to the weakening of the aortic wall and also may well be the main cause of the rupture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> observed occasionally </plain></SENT>
