<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A high-capacity low-cost mutation scanning method based on denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) has been recently introduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have implemented an automated and cost-effective strategy using DHPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To facilitate the semi-automated analysis of multiple exons, two steps were taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first step was the development of a PCR protocol for the amplification of multiple exons under the same conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primer sets, which amplify each exon in the entire gene, were aliquoted to and air-dried on a 96-well format PCR plate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this way, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the exons in a gene can be simultaneously amplified on a single PCR machine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second step was the serial DHPLC analysis of multiple amplicons under conditions optimal for each amplicon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We named the 96-well plate containing the primer pairs and the corresponding computer file used to analyze each amplicon under the pre-determined optimal conditions as the "Condition-Oriented-PCR primer-Embedded-Reactor plate," or the COPPER plate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We have developed COPPER plate systems for more than 20 congenital disorders including classic congenital syndromes like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (FBN1: 65 amplicons), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1535927" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CHARGE syndrome</z:e> (CHD7: 39 amplicons), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270972" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="CDL|CDLS|BDLS|CDLS1">de Lange syndrome</z:e> (NIPBL: 46 amplicons), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175695" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Sotos syndrome</z:e> (NSD1: 30 amplicons), and Rubinstein-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265251" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Taybi syndrome</z:e> (CREBBP: 41 amplicons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using the COPPER plate system, we are functioning as a reference laboratory for the clinical molecular diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformation syndromes</z:e> and are presently analyzing more than 200 samples annually from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> over Japan </plain></SENT>
