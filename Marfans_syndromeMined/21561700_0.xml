<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent trials have indicated the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> (a transforming growth factor beta inhibitor) in these patients prevents aortic root enlargement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our clinical trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> versus atenolol in the prevention of progressive dilation of the aorta in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a phase III clinical trial conducted in two institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 150 subjects diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, aged between 5 and 60 years, of both sexes, and who meet the Ghent diagnostic criteria will be included in the study, with 75 patients per treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It will be a randomized, double blind trial with parallel assignment to atenolol versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> (50 mg per day in patients below 50 kg and 100 mg per day in patients over 50 kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both growth and distensibility of the aorta will be assessed with echocardiography and magnetic resonance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up will be 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> versus atenolol in the prevention of progressive dilation of the aorta, improved aortic distensibility, and prevention of adverse events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> or rupture, cardiovascular surgery, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) will be assessed in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It will also show the possible treatment benefits at different age ranges and with relation to the initial level of aortic root dilation </plain></SENT>
