<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the FBN1 gene cause deficient processing of fibrillin-1, the main constituent of extracellular microfibrils, affecting tissues displaying elastic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations are widespread and involve the skeletal, ocular, cardiovascular and pulmonary systems, skin and integumentum, and dura </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A highly <z:mp ids='MP_0003761'>arched palate</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000278'>retrognathia</z:hpo> have been assigned to the symptoms with minor diagnostic specificity, although epidemiological data on prevalence are lacking yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> (n = 26) were studied for craniofacial characteristics using cephalometric measurements on lateral cranial radiographs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The purposes of this study were (1) to compare cephalometric variables of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> group with age- and sex-matched population norms, and (2) to assess differences in palatal vault dimensions among adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> (n = 17) and matched controls (n = 32) by means of cephalometric measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant differences with population norms were found in the structures of the cranial base, the maxillary complex, the mandible body, and the relations of the jaws with respect to the cranial base and to each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Palatal height and palatal length were significantly larger in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, and were significantly correlated to each other and to the height of the maxillo-alveolar processus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present data disprove in part previously reported findings, possibly due to biased patient selection in these studies or demographic differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, a strong correlation was found between maxillary/mandibular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000278'>retrognathia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000276'>long face</z:hpo>, highly <z:mp ids='MP_0003761'>arched palate</z:mp>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A combination of both intrinsic genetic factors and environmental factors is suggested as a possible explanation for specific morphogenetic aspects of the craniofacial complex in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
