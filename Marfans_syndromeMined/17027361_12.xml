<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of multiple displacement amplification (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) for whole-genome amplification in the preimplantation genetic diagnosis (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi>) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Multiple displacement amplification was used to amplify the whole-genome directly from a single cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> product was used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of five different loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At this point <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> was used to develop a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Fertility and gynecology private center in Alicante, Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENT(S): A couple in which the husband is affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and carries a novel mutation in the FBN-1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION(S): The <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> of single cells and PCR tests for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Allele drop-out (ADO), amplification efficiency rates, and the ability to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> using <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULT(S): We report that isothermal whole-genome amplification from single cells allowed analysis of five different loci using standard conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The development of a <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi> protocol for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> allowed for the diagnosis of seven embryos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These were biopsied on day 3 of culture and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two healthy embryos were transferred 48 hours after culture, resulting in a singleton ongoing pregnancy and the birth of a healthy child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION(S): The <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> technique is useful for overcoming the problem of insufficient genomic DNA in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The use of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> as a universal step marks a new cycle for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi> as it allows for the diagnosis of any known gene defect by standard methods and conditions </plain></SENT>
