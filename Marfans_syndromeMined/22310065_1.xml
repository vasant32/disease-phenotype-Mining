<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The major vascular complication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> is <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>Abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> (AAA) is an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277564" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">acquired disease</z:e> of later life of unknown etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine if genetic aberrations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>-related genes FBN1 and TGFBR2 are present in patients with AAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We assessed the presence of copy number variation (CNV) in FBN1 and TGFBR2 genes in AAA biopsies from twelve patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also analyzed the expression of these genes in AAA biopsies compared to control biopsies from six organ donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition we assessed the expression of two members of the Notch signaling pathway NOTCH3 and HEY2 as well as aortic smooth muscle cell (AoSMC) differentiation marker TAGLN in AAA and control biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Loss of one copy (deletion) of the FBN1 exon 66 sequence and TGFBR2 exon 8 was identified in 7 (58%) and 11 (92%) of the 12 AAA biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No copy number amplifications (duplications) were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients carrying TGFBR2 exon 8 deletion showed marked downregulation of this gene in AAA biopsies compared to control biopsies (0.699 vs. 1.765, p = 0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Notch signaling components NOTCH3 and HEY2 were markedly downregulated in AAA, while expression of the AoSMC differentiation marker TAGLN did not differ between AAA and control biopsies (0.468 vs. 0.486, p = 0.546) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study suggests an acquired impairment in TGF-Î² signaling that along with downregulation of the Notch signaling pathway may contribute to the pathogenesis of AAA </plain></SENT>
