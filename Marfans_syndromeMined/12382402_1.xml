<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Without treatment, the life expectancy of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is reduced by the associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001626'>cardiovascular abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we reviewed our experience of the surgical treatment of this condition to identify the primary indication for surgical repair and the optimal surgical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 1986 and December 2000, 44 patients underwent surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> at Shizuoka City Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 28 male and 16 female patients, with a mean age of 40.9 +/- 15.0 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nineteen of the patients had developed type A dissection of the aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients underwent remodelling of the aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten patients required multiple repeat surgical interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were four early and five late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The survival rate at 1, 5, and at 10 years was 90.9%, 80.5%, and 74.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Freedom from postoperative events, which included cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, additional surgery, and new or repeat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> at 1, 5, and at 10 years was 93.0%, 69.1%, and 53.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among patients having type A dissection, the mean annual enlargement in the diameter at the level of the proximal descending aorta was 4.0 +/- 4.0 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Postoperative echocardiography with Doppler studies was performed in series on patients who had received remodelling of the aortic root, with subsequent mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> in 2 patients and moderate regurgitation in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Repeated postoperative studies with CT scans and earlier surgical intervention before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> are mandatory for improvement in the long-term survival rate of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A valve-sparing procedure for a deformed aortic valve is promising, although the long-term results are not yet clear </plain></SENT>
