<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A single base change resulted in substitution of arginine618 by glutamine at the Y position of a Gly-X-Y repeat, and is responsible for the decreased migration in <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gels of some pro alpha 2(I) chains of type I collagen synthesized by dermal fibroblasts from this individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Family studies suggest that this substitution was inherited from the individual's father who also produces abnormally migrating pro alpha 2(I) collagen chains and shares some of the abnormal skeletal features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This single base change creates a new Bsu36 I (Sau I, Mst II) restriction site detectable in genomic DNA by Southern blot analysis when probed with a COL1A2 fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The analysis of 52 control individuals (103 chromosomes) was negative for the new Bsu36 I site, suggesting that the substitution is not a common polymorphism </plain></SENT>
