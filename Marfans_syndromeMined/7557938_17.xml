<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this investigation was to establish whether and to what extent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in the young may be ascribable to the substrate of underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 182 young people (&lt; or = 35 years) who died of cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> and underwent postmortem examination, 58 (32%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven showed an intrapericardial rupture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, in the setting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in two, isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> in two, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> and isthmic coarctation in three; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> exhibited equally severe degeneration of the aortic wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen cases had conduction system anomalies, mostly bypass tracts; 15 coronary artery anomalies (three ostial valve-like stenosis, five origin from the wrong aortic sinus, and seven deep intramyocardial course); 12 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>; five postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> including scar following ventriculotomy, conduction system injury, and defects left unrepaired; and three congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic valve stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One third of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden deaths</z:hpo> in the young was ascribable to structural defects present since birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A large spectrum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> involves the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>, but most structural defects are usually not considered to be life threatening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some of these concealed defects are potentially detectable in life by clinical imaging techniques </plain></SENT>
