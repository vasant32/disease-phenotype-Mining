<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutation scanning of the FBN1 gene with DNA direct sequencing is time-consuming and expensive because of its large size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study analyzed the diagnostic value of high-resolution melting analysis as an alternative method for scanning of the FBN1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 75 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicons (179-301bp, average 256bp) that covered the complete coding regions and splicing sites were evaluated on the 96-well LightCycler system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Melting curves were analyzed as fluorescence derivative plots (-dF/dT vs. temperature) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine the sensitivity of this method, a total of 82 samples from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and 50 unaffected individuals were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> mutations reported in this study had been confirmed previously by direct sequencing analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Melting analysis identified 48 heterozygous variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The variant c.3093 G&gt;T (exon 25) was incorrectly identified by melting curve analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of the technique in this sample was 98.78% (81/82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated that high-resolution melting analysis is a reliable gene scanning method with greater speed than DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results support the use of this technology as an alternative method for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> as well as its suitability for high-throughput mutation scanning of other large genes </plain></SENT>
