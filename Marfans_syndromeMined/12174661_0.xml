<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She recently underwent axillo-bifemoral bypass to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of the lower extremities caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient was admitted for surgical treatment to treat a remaining dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0004954'>descending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aortography revealed that the entry was present at the takeoff of the left subclavian artery, and that the false lumen extended up the proximal anastomosis of the Y-graft to where the true lumen ended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the abdominal vessels originated from this false lumen, with the lower extremities being supplied via an axillo-bifemoral bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No re-entry was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Replacement of the descending aorta was carried out using a 28 mm woven Dacron graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>First, double-barreled distal anastomosis under single clamping was performed; then, proximal anastomosis was carried out under antegrade perfusion from the graft to shorten the ischemic time of the abdominal organs </plain></SENT>
