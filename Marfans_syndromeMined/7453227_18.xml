<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Until recently, surgical correction of Marfan defects of the aortic root has been undertaken with some hesitancy because of the high perioperative risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Division of Medical Genetics at Johns Hopkins follows about 300 patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and during the past 8 years 13 of these were referred to the senior author (V.L.G.) for aortic valve replacement and repair of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively, four of the 13 patients were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV (3/4 required emergency operation), three patients were in Class III, and six were in Class II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aortic diameter at the mid-valve level ranged from 5.3 cm to 8.2 cm on M-mode echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first two patients received a separate Bj√∂rk-Shiley prosthesis and a woven <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53251">Teflon</z:chebi> graft and the last 11 patients had a composite valve-graft with direct coronary implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up ranges from 6 months to 8.1 years and is complete for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 13 patients (mean of 23 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred 2 and 20 months postoperatively from presumed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and two late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred at 4 and 6 months from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival rate at 3 years is 61% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Some pathologists claim that the incidence of dissection of the aorta does not increase with increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> in the Marfan patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six of our 13 patients, however, had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> at the time of surgery (two DeBakey Type I, three Type II, and one Type III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With the low hospital mortality that can now be achieved in the Marfan patient, and with the relatively high incidence of clinically unrecognized dissection, we fell that strong consideration should be given to earlier prophylactic repair in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Operation may be indicated even in the asymptomatic Marfan patient with an aortic root diameter greater than 5.5 cm </plain></SENT>
