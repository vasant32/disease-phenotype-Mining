<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the location and character of many of the causal mutations in LDS intuitively imply diminished TGF-β signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data have engendered controversy regarding the specific role of TGF-β in disease pathogenesis </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified causative variation in ten individuals with SGS in the proto-oncogene SKI, a known repressor of TGF-β activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cultured dermal fibroblasts from affected individuals showed enhanced activation of TGF-β signaling cascades and higher expression of TGF-β-responsive genes relative to control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Morpholino-induced silencing of SKI paralogs in zebrafish recapitulated abnormalities seen in humans with SGS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data support the conclusions that increased TGF-β signaling is the mechanism underlying SGS and that high signaling contributes to multiple syndromic presentations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
