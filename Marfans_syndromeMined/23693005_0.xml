<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two patients, a 38-year-old male and a 45-year-old female, were asymptomatic, but were referred to a clinical geneticist because multiple family members had died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> at a young age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The third patient, a 55-year-old female, has been monitored for the past 26 years due to mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> after three brothers had died suddenly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At screening, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these patients were diagnosed with multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002758'>osteoarthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pathogenic SMAD3 mutations were identified as the cause of the vascular catastrophes in these families </plain></SENT>
