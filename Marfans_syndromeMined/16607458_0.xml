<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although linkage analysis is often required to ascertain the disease status in family members, recombination is a problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 6 families including 18 patients using 4 intragenic microsatellite markers, located in intron 1, 5, 28, and 43, respectively, of the FBN1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Haplotypes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> family members could be established, and segregation analysis showed no recombination between the markers and the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After confirming the diagnosis, intrafamilial analysis revealed clinical manifestations involving the ocular, cardiac, and skeletal systems </plain></SENT>
