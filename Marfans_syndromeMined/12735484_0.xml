<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The medical management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan Syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) mainly relies on early prevention of the aortic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic treatments try to diminish the forcefulness of cardiac contractions and to reduce blood pressure: for example long term administration of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> may significantly reduce the rate of increase in aortic ratio (aortic diameter/expected aortic diameter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Retardation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> may be most often observed by early treatment started when the baseline end-diastolic aortic root diameter is &lt; 40 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It seems better to use beta-blockers without intrinsic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35524">sympathomimetic</z:chebi> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Successful acceptance of beta-blockers may be limited by side-effects, but the efficiency of alternative hypotensive agents (calcium channel inhibitors, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitors</z:chebi>) is not yet validated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gene therapy might constitute an etiologic specific treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FBN1-RZ1 hammerhead antisense ribozyme is able to suppress expression of the mutant FBN1 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The use of ribozymes as systemic therapeutic agents will depend on efficient delivery to its target, but the various proposed vectors raise yet unsolved problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A hydrogel angioplasty balloon might be a possible vector for delivering an antisense ribozyme in the aortic wall specifically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ribozymes--as deoxyribonucleotides--may be taken up by tissue upon local application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further research should study ex vivo local application of antisense ribozyme on human aortic wall, before assessing in vivo efficiency and tolerance of this aortic local vectorisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is always necessary to maintain a balanced <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intake in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Firstly to prevent the multiple noxious effects of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> deficiency on cardiovascular targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Secondly to ensure the best efficiency and the least toxicity of the hemodynamic drugs used as long term prophylactic treatment for cardiovascular complications and of the etiologic antisense <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi>-dependent gene therapy, in the future </plain></SENT>
