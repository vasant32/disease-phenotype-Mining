<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>Mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, the most common form of this disease, is presumed to affect approximately 2% to 3% of the population and remains one of the most common causes of valvular surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the past years, important effort has been made to better understand the pathophysiological basis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>Autosomal-dominant</z:hpo> transmission is the usual <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003829'>reduced penetrance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003828'>variable expressivity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three loci have been mapped to chromosomes 16p11-p12, 11p15.4 and 13q31-32, but the underlying genetic defects are not currently known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> recessive form has been originally described by Monteleone and Fagan in 1969 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Starting from one large French family and three smaller other families in which MVP was transmitted with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> pattern, we have been able to identify three filamin A mutations p.Gly288Arg and p.Val711Asp and a 1,944-bp genomic deletion coding for exons 16 to 19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this review, we describe the genetic, echocardiographic and functional aspects of the filamin-A-related myxomatous mitral valve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
