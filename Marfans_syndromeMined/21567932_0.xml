<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To date, over 70 mutations in the TGFBR2 gene have been reported in patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> type 2 (MFS2), or other hereditary thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and dissections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of mutations analyzed thus far are predicted to disrupt the constitutively active C-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain of TGFBR2, mounting evidence suggests that the molecular mechanism underlying these diseases is more complex than simple haploinsufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using exon-targeted oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization, we identified an âˆ¼896 kb deletion of TGFBR2 in a 20-month-old female with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>global developmental delay</z:hpo>, but no stigmata of LDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FISH analysis showed no evidence of this deletion in the parental peripheral blood samples; however, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001442'>somatic mosaicism</z:hpo> was detected using PCR in the paternal DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes and lymphoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that TGFBR2 haploinsufficiency may cause a phenotype, which is distinct from LDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we propose that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001442'>somatic mosaicism</z:hpo> below the detection threshold of FISH analysis in asymptomatic parents of children with genomic disorders may be more common than previously recognized </plain></SENT>
