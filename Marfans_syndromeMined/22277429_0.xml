<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The discovery of the causative gene for hereditary cerebral small vessel disease (CARASIL: Cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>Autosomal Recessive</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Arteriopathy</z:e> with Subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>Leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo>) opens a new avenue for exploring the pathogenesis of cerebral small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The causative gene for CARASIL is HTRA1 (high-temperature requirement A1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HTRA1 is a serine protease and inhibits TGF-β signaling in their protease activity-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CARASIL-associated mutant HTRA1s lost their protease activity and increase the TGF-β family signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However the precious molecular mechanism for inhibition of TGF-β signaling by HTRA1 has not been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have found that HTRA1 aberrantly cleaved pro-TGF-β in an endoplasmic reticulum and the cleaved products were degraded by the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The result reconfirms the importance of HTRA1 for TGF-β signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The study for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, which is caused by the increasing TGF-β signaling in aortic artery, indicates that the angiotensin I receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, a drug already in clinical use for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, inhibits TGF-β signaling and ameliorates the disease progression in model mouse as well as patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In human brain, angiotensin I receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> also inhibits TGF-β signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore angiotensin I receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> warrants investigation as a therapeutic strategy for patients with CARASIL </plain></SENT>
