<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such factors include a specific syndrome the essential feature of which is that the mitral leaflets or part thereof, primarily the posterior one, are voluminous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The syndrome has stimulated widespread interest and study during the last decade and various descriptive terms, including the "billowing mitral leaflet syndrome" (BMLS), have been applied to it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A familial occurrence of the BMLS may be detected and symptoms include <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conduction defects</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> which mimic occlusive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> are important features which remain ill understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that there is a possible relationship between the so-called "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340520" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">athlete's heart</z:e>" and the BMLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also postulate that the entity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> without demonstrable occlusive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> is, in at least some instances, a complication of the BMLS-possibly on the basis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary spasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo>, infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, or, rarely, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> may supervene in the BMLS but we conclude, from published data and our own experience, that the prognosis is generally good </plain></SENT>
