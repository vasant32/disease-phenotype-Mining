<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We assess the outcome of emergency total arch replacement with a modified elephant trunk technique for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> to clarify whether our aggressive approach is justified in certain patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 2000 and 2006, 54 patients (55.1% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) underwent emergency total arch replacement for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The surgery was performed using open distal anastomosis with selective antegrade cerebral perfusion under <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total arch replacement with individual arch-vessel reconstruction was applied in the following settings: the intimal tear in the transverse arch or the proximal descending aorta, massive arch dissection, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, and atheromatous arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the distal anastomosis, a modified elephant trunk procedure was added for secure anastomosis and early thrombosed closure of the false channel in the descending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only 2 patients (3.7%) died of low cardiac output, in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> had developed preoperatively owing to rupture of the arch or to left coronary artery malperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 4 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from nonaortic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the follow-up computed tomographic scanning, a high incidence of early thrombosed closure of the false channel in the dissected descending aorta was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 2 patients, whose tear had not been resected in the first surgery, required reoperation of the descending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Total arch replacement with an elephant trunk procedure, which permits immediate survival and provides early thrombosed closure of the distal false channel, is justified in certain patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection </plain></SENT>
