<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In the late postoperative period after repair of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> or dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, reoperations may be required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The interval to reoperation, size and location of intimal tear, and results of reoperation were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 1982 and April 1997, 138 patients underwent surgery for Stanford type A (90 patients) or type B (48 patients) dissections of the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The entire aorta was evaluated in postoperative follow-up by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging for 6 months to 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reoperations were performed in 14 (10.1%) patients with changes in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> at the site of the initial repair or in the distal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Selective cerebral perfusion or retrograde cerebral perfusion with deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> was used in the repair of the ascending, arch, and distal arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reoperations included aortic root reconstruction (n=3), resection of a pseudoaneurysm (n=1), and replacement of the ascending aorta (n=1), arch (n=5), descending aorta (n=2), thoracoabdominal aorta (n=1), or abdominal aorta (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Secondary reoperations were performed in four patients (replacement of the arch [n=2], thoracoabdominal aorta and abdominal aorta) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consequently two patients had subtotal aortic replacements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were caused by an anastomotic leak, a new intimal tear following aortic cross-clamping, a second intimal tear in the distal arch or abdominal aorta, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two patients (2/18 11.1%) died of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> or low output syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients died of graft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> or prosthetic valve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> 3 months after surgery respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 1) The surgical results of reoperation for type A and B dissections were good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>2) Close postoperative follow-up of the patent false lumen in the entire aorta was necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>3) At the initial operation, total resection of the intimal tear in the aortic arch in low-risk patients reduced the risk of reoperation </plain></SENT>
