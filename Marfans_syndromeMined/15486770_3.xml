<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiology of these two syndromes is considered in relation to fibrillin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASES: Case 1 was a 5-year-old boy who showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000592'>blue sclera</z:hpo> and bilateral enlargement of optic disc cupping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case 2 was a 24-year-old man who had partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000589'>coloboma</z:hpo> of the lens, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo>, and bilateral glaucomatous disc cupping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBSERVATIONS: Beals syndrome was diagnosed in these two patients based on the initial examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In further investigations, while the patients were being observed without treatment, the intra ocular pressure of both patients remained within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Funduscopy showed that the cup-to-disc ratio was 0.8 bilaterally in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Case 1 was followed up for 6 years with no changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound biomicroscopy examination in case 2 revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0007774'>hypoplasia of the ciliary body</z:hpo>, leading to a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This patient remains under observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Two cases of Beals syndrome with ocular complications including glaucomatous optic disc cupping are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ophthalmic examinations are recommended to identify the ocular complications of Beals syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to elucidate the relation between fibrillin abnormality and ocular complications in Beals syndrome </plain></SENT>
