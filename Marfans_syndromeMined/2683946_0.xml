<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical features were caricatural </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The skin was of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000973'>cutis laxa</z:hpo> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both infants died shortly after birth as a result of severe cardiovascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histologic examination of the aortic media confirmed the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because this genetic connective tissue <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is inherited on an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> basis with strong penetrance, and because in both instances the two parents had a negative family history, a dominant mutation seems likely in our cases and prompted us to be optimistic when giving genetic counseling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We point out the characteristic features of these exceptional early forms and describe the results of a detailed histologic examination of the skin that completes data from the literature </plain></SENT>
