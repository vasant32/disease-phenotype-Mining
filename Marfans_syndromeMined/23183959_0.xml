<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this progressive disease, less is known about manifestations and progression of cardiovascular symptoms in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To define a certain decision regarding therapeutic options, knowledge concerning the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of cardiovascular findings is essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From 1998 to 2011, suspected pediatric Marfan patients were subjected to a standardized diagnostic program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular findings were analyzed in terms of age at first clinical manifestation, prevalence and gender differences, morbidity, mortality, and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> was diagnosed in 82 patients (46 boys; mean age at diagnosis, 9.0 ± 5.7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At first presentation, aortic root dilation was found in 56 % of patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> in 31 %, whereas <z:mp ids='MP_0010557'>pulmonary artery dilation</z:mp> was detected in 22 % and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001704'>tricuspid valve prolapse</z:hpo> in only 17 % of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aortic (2.5 %) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral valve regurgitations</z:hpo> (22 %) are significantly correlated with aortic root dilation (p &lt; 0.01) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05) but without relevant progression during childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic medication was initiated for 42 % of the patients (mean age, 8.0 ± 4.5 years) because of progressive aortic root dilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic dissection</z:hpo> did not appear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Aortic root surgery was needed for 4 % of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Gender-specific differences in cardiovascular findings, progression of disease, or treatment did not appear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Comparable with adults, aortic root dilation is the most frequent cardiovascular finding in children and associated with relevant morbidity, whereas aortic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral valve regurgitation</z:hpo> are of minor clinical relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Manifestation at an early age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slow progression</z:hpo> of cardiovascular findings underscore the necessity of repeated echocardiographic examinations for early diagnosis and start of prophylactic treatment </plain></SENT>
