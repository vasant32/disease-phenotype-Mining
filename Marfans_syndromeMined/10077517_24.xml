<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The modern imaging techniques of transesophageal echocardiography, CT, and MRI are reported to have up to 100% sensitivity in detecting the classic class of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>; however, anecdotal reports of patient <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from a missed diagnosis of subtle classes of variants are increasingly being noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In a series of 181 consecutive patients who had ascending or aortic arch repairs, 9 patients (5%) had subtle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> not diagnosed preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> preoperative studies in patients with missed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> were reviewed in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 9 patients (2 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, 1 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu's disease</z:e>) with undiagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> had undergone &gt;/=3 imaging techniques, with the finding of ascending <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> (4.7 to 9 cm) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 9 and significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic valve regurgitation</z:hpo> in 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 6 patients, an eccentric ascending aortic bulge was present but not diagnostic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> on aortography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At operation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> tears were limited in extent and involved the intima without extensive undermining of the intima or an intimal "flap." Eight had composite valve grafts inserted, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the larger series of 181 patients, 98% (179 of 181) were 30-day survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> not proven by modern noninvasive imaging techniques, further study should be performed, including multiple views of the ascending aorta by aortography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If patients have an ascending <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, particularly if eccentric on aortography and associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic valve regurgitation</z:hpo>, an urgent surgical repair should be considered, with excellent results expected </plain></SENT>
