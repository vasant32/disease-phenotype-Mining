<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In 1977, we proposed the use of gelatin-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="27810">resorcinol</z:chebi>-formol (GRF) biological glue during surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 1977 to March 1998, 204 patients (146 men and 58 women) aged from 15 to 79 years (mean 54 +/- 11) underwent emergency operation for type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred sixty-five patients (84%) were operated on within 48 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients (13.7%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 43 patients (23%), the aortic valve was replaced either independently (6, 3%) or by means of a composite graft (37, 18.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because of the location of the intimal tear, aortic replacement included the transverse arch in 60 patients (29.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hospital mortality was 21% (39 patients): 25% in patients with arch replacement and 19.4% in patients without arch replacement (ns) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One hundred sixty-one patients were discharged and followed from 2 months to 21 years postoperatively (mean 85 +/- 66 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During this interval, 25 patients (15.5%) required reoperation for a total of 33 reoperations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (28%) died at reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Upon univariate analysis, presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (p &lt; 0.05) and absence of arch replacement (p &lt; 0.02) were risk factors for reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Emergency operation (p &lt; 0.01) and thoracoabdominal replacement (p &lt; 0.04) were risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The actuarial freedom from reoperation (Kaplan-Meier, confidence interval 95%) is 96.1% (90.9%-98.2%) at 1 year, 87.6% (79.8%-92.7%) at 5 years, 80.9% (70.8%-88.1%) at 10 years, and 66.4% (51.1%-78.9%) at 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A total of 39 patients (24.3%) died during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (p &lt; 0.01), reoperation (p &lt; 0.02), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05) were risk factors for late mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The actuarial late survival including hospital mortality is 71.5% (64.3%-77.8%) at 1 year, 66% (58.3%-73%) at 5 years, 56.4% (47.7%-64.7%) at 10 years, and 46.3% (36.4%-56.5%) at 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The GRF glue has proven extremely useful during emergency initial surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection, making the procedure much easier and safer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>As a result of this operative improvement, the use of the GRF glue seems to have had a beneficial influence on late results, but these also depend upon the patient's basic condition </plain></SENT>
