<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: From 1983 to 1996, 250 children were screened for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serial echocardiographic aortic root measurements of 123 children (57 Marfan, 66 control) were available for evaluation of aortic root growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aortic root diameters were correlated with body surface area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on individual growth of the aortic root a discrimination formula was derived to distinguish Marfan patients from control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity of this method, which were dependent on the number of measurements, were 84% and 73%, respectively, for three serial measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The discrimination score also predicted a five year complication free survival in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In children and adolescents with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, aortic root growth differs significantly from subjects in whom <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> was definitely ruled out during screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Measurement of individual aortic root growth may serve to establish diagnosis at an early stage and is of prognostic value for occurrence of aortic complications </plain></SENT>
