<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a new growing rod technique in controlling infantile <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Infantile <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is nearly always progressive and poorly controlled by bracing, yet previous studies have shown poor results with first-generation extensible spinal rod techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> developing before 3 years of age were treated with growing rods (3 single, 7 dual) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean age at initial surgery was 5.3 years (SD, 2.7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Before surgery, the mean curve was 77.2 degrees (SD, 15.6 degrees ) and the mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0005619'>thoracolumbar kyphosis</z:hpo> was 56 degrees (SD, 21 degrees ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10034">warfarin sodium</z:chebi> were lengthened at yearly intervals; others, more frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 87 months (SD, 30.5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean curve correction was 51% (SD, 23%) overall, 31% (SD, 23%) for single rods, and 60% (SD, 19%) for dual rods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean coronal and sagittal imbalance improved from 56 to 18 mm and from 31 to 21 mm, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean length obtained was 11.5 cm (SD, 3.6 cm) overall and 11.2 cm (SD, 3.60 cm) for the 5 patients with final fusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complications included 2 rod breakages and 3 intraoperative dural leaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was 1 anchor dislodgement and no postoperative dural leak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No patient developed clinically noteworthy junctional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>One patient died of unrelated causes 3 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: As life expectancy improves for patients with neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, spinal deformity becomes an important issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Extensible spinal growing rods are an effective solution to the problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Dual rods appear to be more corrective than single rods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Substantial spinal length can be obtained to minimize trunk disproportion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Growing rods may help prevent large infantile curves from becoming severe in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, allowing definitive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>spinal fusion</z:hpo> closer to skeletal maturity </plain></SENT>
