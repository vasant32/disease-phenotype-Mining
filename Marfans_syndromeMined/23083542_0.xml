<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This systematic review examined the use of beta-blockers, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor blockers in the management of <z:mp ids='MP_0010574'>aortic dilation</z:mp> in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched four databases - Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials - two conference proceedings, references of retrieved articles, and a web-based trial registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The secondary outcomes were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, need for elective surgical repair, change in <z:mp ids='MP_0010574'>aortic dilation</z:mp>, and adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two reviewers selected studies, abstracted data, and assessed study quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Meta-analyses were not performed because of study <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 18 studies were included - 12 completed and six in progress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the completed studies, three before-and-after treatment, one prospective cohort, three retrospective cohorts, and two randomised control trials examined beta-blockers; one randomised and one non-randomised trial examined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors</z:chebi>; and one retrospective cohort study examined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor blockers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Studies in progress are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> randomised trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mortality was not impacted by drug therapy, although studies were underpowered with respect to this outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> drug classes were associated with a decrease in the rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0010574'>aortic dilation</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor blockers &gt;beta-blockers); none had an impact on other secondary outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of existing evidence, beta-blockers, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor blockers slow the progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0010574'>aortic dilation</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor blockers may have more effect than beta-blockers; however, more methodologically rigorous studies currently in progress are needed to evaluate the impact of drug therapy on clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
