<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Since the original description of composite replacement of the aortic valve and ascending aorta by Bentall in 1968, several modifications of the technique have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate the results of these different techniques, we have retrospectively reviewed our results with 140 consecutive patients who underwent Bentall operations between October 1986 and March 1994, using three different anastomotic techniques: Classic, n = 30; Button, n = 95, and Cabrol, n = 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall hospital mortality was 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection, rupture, new preoperative neurological symptoms, and the Cabrol technique were associated with a higher hospital mortality, but by multivariate analysis no independent risk factors were demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall rates of reoperation did not differ among the three techniques (Classic 4.1%/pt-yr, Button 2.7%/pt-yr, Cabrol 0%/pt-yr; p = 0.44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The actuarial freedom from reoperation was 87% at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 5-year actuarial survival for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 79% (Classic 85%, Button 82%, Cabrol 52%): the poorer results with the Cabrol modification are likely due to patient selection, complicated by a higher early mortality in this small group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of dissection was associated with a higher mortality in Marfan patients (50% vs 8%, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rate of aortic valve-related complications was 3.6%/pt per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Actuarial event-free survival was 67% at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Current indications for an elective Bentall procedure include an ascending aortic diameter of 6 cm or greater, with significant aortic valvular dysfunction, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005111'>dilatation of the ascending aorta</z:hpo> greater than 5 cm in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> or a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The routine procedure of choice is the Button Bentall technique, with the Classic Bentall and the Cabrol variation reserved for use under special circumstances </plain></SENT>
