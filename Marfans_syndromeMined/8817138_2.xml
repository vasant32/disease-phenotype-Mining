<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The original Bentall procedure for the surgery of annulo-aortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> (AAE) includes the risk of leakage and pseudo-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation in the coronary anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To avoid the complications mentioned above we have used the open technique without the graft inclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we evaluate our early and late results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients with annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> underwent surgical repair with composite graft between December 1975 and February 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases the aneurysmal tissue was radically resected and the origins of the coronary arteries were directly reimplanted to the tube prosthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No wrapping was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients met the clinical criteria of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of the patients underwent an emergency operation, because of a rupture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in 2 cases and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection in 11 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional procedures were performed in 16 patients: mitral valve replacement in 2, coronary artery bypass grafting in 12 patients and in 2 cases the tube prosthesis included aortic arch, too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall hospital mortality was 3.0% (3/100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the elective group there was one hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (1/87; 1.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the emergency group two patients died in the operation room (2/13; 16.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There have been 13 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> among the 97 hospital survivors (13.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Four of the late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were surgery related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Routine control angiography was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients 6 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Sixty patients who had lived at least 3 years after surgery were called to reangiography and 53 of them came </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>No pseudo-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> or leakage at distal anastomosis or coronary anastomosis could be seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A slight <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of one or both coronary origins was observed on 15 patients; 9 of whom had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The open technique is simple and can be used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> anatomical variations of the annulo-aortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The early and late results are at least comparable with those achieved by other techniques </plain></SENT>
