<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, the complications of aortic degeneration, including dissection, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, and rupture represent the main cause of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although contemporary management of ascending <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> requires open surgical reconstruction, endovascular repair is now available for management of descending thoracic and abdominal aortic pathology (ie, thoracic endovascular aortic repair [TEVAR], endovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> repair [EVAR]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The short- and long-term benefit of endovascular repair in Marfan patients remains largely unproven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examine our outcomes after EVAR in this patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who were treated with TEVAR/EVAR were evaluated in a retrospective review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Perioperative, procedure-specific and patient covariate data were aggregated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary endpoints were overall mortality and procedural success as divided into three categories: (1) successful therapy, (2) primary failure, or (3) secondary failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 2000 and June 2010, 16 patients were identified as having undergone 19 TEVAR/EVAR procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These included three emergent operations (two for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection/malperfusion and one for anastomotic disruption early after open repair) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 16 patients had previously undergone at least one (range, 1-5) open operation of the ascending aorta or arch at a time interval from 33 years to 1 week prior to the index endovascular repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 9.3 months (range, 0-46 months), there were four <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six patients (38%) had successful endovascular interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Despite early success, there was one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in this group at 1 month postintervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (44%) experienced primary treatment failure with five undergoing open conversion and one undergoing left subclavian coil embolization (the seventh was lost to follow-up and presented 4 months later in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> and expired without repair) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There were three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the primary treatment failure group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Two patients experienced secondary treatment failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>One underwent the index TEVAR for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection with malperfusion and required a subsequent TEVAR for more distal aortic pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>He is stable without disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The other patient underwent open conversion after a second EVAR with four-vessel "chimney" stent grafts and is stable with his entire native aorta having been replaced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Aortic disease</z:e> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is a complex clinical problem and many patients require remedial procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Endovascular therapy can provide a useful adjunct or bridge to open surgical treatment in selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, failure of endovascular therapy is common, and its use should be judicious with close follow-up to avoid delay if open surgical repair is required </plain></SENT>
