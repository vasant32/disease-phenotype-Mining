<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied the relation between coagulation activation and aortic diameter in Marfan patients (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) with various aortic diameters (n=52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We then studied patients presenting large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp>) and degenerative form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lastly, we used immunochemistry and biochemistry to investigate prothrombin/thrombin retention within the aortic wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microparticles, sGPV, tissue factor, and TAT complexes were increased in plasma from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> with large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (&gt;or=45 mm) compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> with limited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> (&lt;45 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar elevations were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with large <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo>, regardless of the etiology, the site of maximal <z:mp ids='MP_0010574'>aortic dilation</z:mp>, associated valvulopathy, risk factors, or treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>P-selectin and platelet-bound fibrinogen were also increased, demonstrating platelet activation in large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant increase in sCD146 plasma concentration suggested alteration of endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Platelet activation occurs in patients with large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta, is dependent on <z:mp ids='MP_0010574'>aortic dilation</z:mp>, and is associated with thrombin generation, part of which appears to be retained in mucoid degeneration areas </plain></SENT>
