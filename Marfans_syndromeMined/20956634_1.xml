<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) results from mutations in the TGFBR1 or TGFBR2 genes and is known to cause aggressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and dissections at an early age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, craniofacial, skeletal, and cardiovascular findings play an important role in early recognition of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While many patients do have recognizable cutaneous features of LDS, little information about associated skin findings has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBSERVATIONS: Four unrelated patients with LDS due to a mutation in the TGFBR2 gene were observed to have numerous facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001056'>milia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 4 patients reported that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001056'>milia</z:hpo> had been present since early childhood and had increased in number with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In some cases, affected relatives were reported to have similar findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, the association of LDS and facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001056'>milia</z:hpo> has not been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recognition of LDS is important because the aggressive aortic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> warrants early surgical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001056'>milia</z:hpo> and other cutaneous findings may possibly differentiate LDS from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and other related disorders, thereby facilitating early diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, each of the 4 patients with LDS and facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001056'>milia</z:hpo> had a mutation in TGFBR2 despite widespread variability in other features of the disease </plain></SENT>
