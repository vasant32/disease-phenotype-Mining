<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Unlike myxomatous degeneration in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, which has been reported to result from a mutation in the gene that codes for the extracellular structural protein fibrillin, no specific molecular abnormality has been documented to be the underlying cause of myxomatous degeneration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> syndrome (MVPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study examined the distribution of fibrillin and other extracellular matrix proteins in patients with isolated MVPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mitral valve leaflets from 7 MVPS patients and 5 rheumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> (RHD) patients were characterized immunohistochemically for fibrillin, elastin, collagen I, and collagen III distribution, and compared with five <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mitral valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mitral valve leaflets immunostaining for fibrillin, elastin, collagen I, and collagen III revealed a fibrillary and laminar pattern in the atrialis and the spongiosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, both the collagens were present in the ventricularis, and the coarse bundles in the fibrosa exhibited alternating bandlike collagen I immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The staining patterns of fibrillin, elastin, and collagens I and III revealed distinctly different distribution in MVPS relative to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and RHD leaflets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MVPS leaflets in areas of myxoid degeneration displayed a more diffuse, weaker, and nonlaminar pattern of staining for fibrillin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar, but less severe abnormality of elastin, collagen I, and collagen III was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unlike diffuse abnormality in MVPS, the disruption of extracellular proteins in RHD only occurred at the site of the inflammatory damage, but the overall architecture was preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study suggest a primary role for abnormal fibrillin and other matrix proteins in producing myxoid degeneration of mitral valve leaflets in MVPS </plain></SENT>
