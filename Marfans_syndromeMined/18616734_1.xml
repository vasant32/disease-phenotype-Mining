<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total sample of 107 included three groups of participants: parents (n = 39), adolescents (n = 37, ages 14-21 years) and young adults (n = 16, ages 22-34 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, and HCPs (n = 15), including physicians, genetic counselors, and nurses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were derived from 180 transcripts of audiotaped interviews and a sociodemographic survey </plain></SENT>
