<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The defective gene(s) behind this <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> condition has not been found despite considerable research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main targets of the research have been the genes coding for connective tissue components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several of the candidate genes suspected to be defective in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> are located on the long arm of chromosome 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These genes include a cluster of two genes coding for fibrillar collagens COL3A1 and COL5A2, and a third member of the collagen gene family: COL6A3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, genes for elastin (ELN) and fibronectin (FN) are also located in this area of chromosome 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We studied this chromosomal area using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) linkage analysis in five Finnish Marfan families with affected members in three generations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two point linkage analyses, Lod scores of -3.192 (theta = 0.1) to COL3A1, -1.683 (theta = 0) to COL6A3 and -2.664 (theta = 0.01) to FN were obtained, whereas the linkage analysis between elastin and the disease was non-informative (Lod score 0.444, theta = 0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With the multipoint linkage analysis that permits simultaneous examination of several loci and more efficient use of family data, we obtained an exclusion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these loci as the site of the mutation leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in these families </plain></SENT>
