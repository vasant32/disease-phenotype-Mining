<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The medical community has resorted to the use of pharmacologic agents based on weak data transplanted from either <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> (AAAs) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> differ significantly based on their anatomic location and etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Epidemiologic and experimental data demonstrate that different genetic and nongenetic risk factors as well as diverse physiologic processes are responsible for the development and progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi>, familial <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi>, and AAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these disease processes need to be considered as distinct entities and not hastily grouped together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The extrapolation of data from one aneurysmal disease process to another is still ill-founded and potentially harmful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> are required before medical therapies, such as Î²-blockers, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors</z:chebi>, angiotensin receptor blockers, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25105">macrolide antibiotics</z:chebi>, can be recommended </plain></SENT>
