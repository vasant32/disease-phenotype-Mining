<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Pediatric Heart Network designed a clinical trial to compare aortic root growth and other short-term cardiovascular outcomes in children and young adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> randomized to receive atenolol or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here the characteristics of the screened population and enrolled subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 2007 and 2011, 21 clinical sites randomized 608 subjects, aged 6 months to 25 years who met the original Ghent criteria and had a body surface area-adjusted aortic root diameter z-score &gt;3.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age at study entry was 11.2 years, 60% were male, and 25% were older teenagers and young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median aortic root diameter z-score was 4.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aortic root diameter z-score did not vary with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>Mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> were more common in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among those with a positive family history, 56% had a family member with aortic surgery, and 32% had a family member with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Baseline demographic, clinical, and anthropometric characteristics of the randomized cohort are representative of patients in this population with moderate to severe aortic root dilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The high percentage of young subjects with relatives who have had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> or surgery illustrates the need for more definitive therapy; we expect that the results of the study and the wealth of systematic data collected will make an important contribution to the management of individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
