<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Doppler fetal echocardiograms were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and rhythm of the fetal heart were examined sequentially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The case was referred because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001640'>cardiomegaly</z:hpo> and dilated great vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequential Doppler echocardiographic evaluation led to the diagnosis of prenatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main features are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001640'>cardiomegaly</z:hpo>, dysplastic atrioventricular valves with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005180'>tricuspid regurgitation</z:hpo> and dilated great vessels, which can be aneurysmal at their origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fetus died in utero at 39 weeks of gestation because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pathological study confirmed the Marfan habitus and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Molecular genetic study showed a de novo point mutation in exon 26 of the FBN1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We report a case of prenatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> diagnosed by sequential evaluation of the cardiac signs, which are essential for prenatal diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prognosis seems as poor as the neonatal one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The prenatal diagnosis is essential for adequate counselling </plain></SENT>
