<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heritable disorder</z:e> of connective tissue which has been associated with mutations in a gene encoding fibrillin, a 350 kD <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> found in microfibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This protein consists of approximately 60 domains, 47 of which have similarity to epidermal growth factor (EGF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first mutations to be detected were found in two <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases that had identical Arg to Pro changes within one EGF-like domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on sequence features common to 43 of the EGF-like domains, it was proposed that these domains might bind calcium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Through the synthesis and characterization of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and mutated single domain <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, we examined the structural and calcium-binding properties of an isolated EGF-like domain from fibrillin and the effects of the Arg to Pro sequence change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> corresponding to the thirteenth putative calcium-binding, EGF-like domain of fibrillin (the site of the first detected mutations) was synthesized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> could be easily oxidized and refolded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The structure of this domain was probed using NMR methods, indicating features characteristic of the known structures of EGF-like domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The domain bound to calcium with moderate affinity (Kd = 0.6 +/- 0.1 mM) with no major changes in structure induced upon calcium binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> containing the Arg to Pro mutation was found to be drastically impaired in its ability to fold in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: As predicted, a fibrillin domain forms a calcium-binding, EGF-like module </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As the putative calcium-binding sites are found at the amino-terminal end of the modules, we propose that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39124">calcium ions</z:chebi> may bind in the interfaces between domains, affecting the overall structure of the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The Arg to Pro mutation blocks domain folding in vitro, suggesting that lack of proper domain folding in vivo may contribute to the molecular defects responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
