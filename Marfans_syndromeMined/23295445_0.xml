<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Conflicting results have been reported on late aortic growth and complication rates of the descending thoracic aorta in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) after proximal aortic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 198 Marfan patients followed up regularly, 121 (43% David-I, 7% David-II, 11% supracoronary replacement, 52% mechanical conduit, 8% arch replacement) were analysed after proximal aortic surgery retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>97% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS1</z:e>, 3% MFS2 (Loeys-Dietz-Syndrome); 56% were male and the mean age was 35 ± 13 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>65% were initially operated on for root/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> and 35% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using automated computed tomography angiography and magnetic resonance angiography cross-sectional analyses, the mean diameters of the distal arch, mid-descending and distal supradiaphragmatic descending thoracic aorta were measured at early and late follow-up (mean 6.3 years for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and 4.7 years for dissections) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of clinical follow-up was 7.6 years and the cumulative clinical follow-up comprised 894 patient-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 20 years, overall freedom from distal aortic complications and/or reintervention was 76% (51-86%) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and 52% (28-71%) for dissections (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In non-dissected aortas, distal aortic growth was significant, but minimal: arches grew from 25.2 ± 0.6 to 26.3 ± 0.8 mm (P = 0.01), mid-descending aortas from 22.2 ± 0.5 to 24.9 ± 1.2 mm (P = 0.05) and distal descending aortas from 22.1 ± 0.7 to 24.2 ± 1.4 (P = 0.02, 0.58 mm/year ± 0.5 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dissected distal aortas increased by a mean of 0.3 ± 0.5 mm/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dissection (P &lt; 0.001), urgent procedure (P = 0.02) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (0.052) were associated with larger distal aortic diameters at late follow-up and more significant aortic growth over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Late distal complication rates are low for patients initially presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The risk of late distal reoperation is dictated by the initial pathology and by the presence of an initial dissection and not by faster distal aortic growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Strategies to completely restore a non-dissected <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> might improve late surgical outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
