<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: Rapid progress has been made in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Today, the treatment is relatively established and the results have also improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Even if surgery is performed, however, vascular lesions may recur late after operation and late prognosis is poor considering the age of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Issues such as whether a reoperation should be conducted or how the late results might be improved are subjects of debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on an analysis of recent late data, we have performed operations according to the new treatment policy, and here report the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 203 consecutive operations were conducted in 141 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who underwent surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> at our department between February 1973 and August 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age of patients was 39 (11 years with a male/female ratio of 95:46 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the first operation, 72 patients were diagnosed with annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> (AAE), 17 patients with AAE + <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection (DeBakey I), 14 patients with AAE + <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection (DeBakey II), 6 patients with AAE + <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection (Stanford A), 11 patients with AAE + dissection (DeBakey III), 9 patients with dissection (DeBakey III) only, 3 patients with AAE + <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> only, and 2 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cause of reoperation were a new lesion in 17 patients, dissection in 13 patients and a true <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 36 patients, an increase in the remaining lesion occurred or a scheduled stage 2 operation was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reoperation was performed following the Bentall operation in 7 patients, dehiscence of the anastomotic region of the coronary artery in 5 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the anastomotic region of the coronary artery in 1 patients, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of the artificial valve with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the anastomotic region of the coronary artery in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were reported in 8 (6%) patients who underwent composite valve graft replacement (including simultaneous arch replacement) for AAE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> also occurred in 8 (13%) patients who underwent a replacement of the aortic arch, descending thoracic or thoracoabdominal aorta, with no cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, the replacement was extensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The observed 10-year survival rate was 70% with a freedom from reoperation of 64% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although dissection did not reduce the observed survival rate, the 10-year freedom from reoperation was significantly decreased at 49% (p = 0.0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: (1) Surgery is indicated for AAE when the maximum diameter of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> prior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of dissection is 5 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In the case of aortic arch without dissection, the Bentall operation with simultaneous arch replacement should be aggressively performed in order to minimize the future risk of vascular events and to eliminate the need for extensive replacement in a reoperation, a procedure which is associated with a high level of risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>(2) Extensive replacement which is associated with poor results should be avoided where possible and, instead, scheduled staged surgery should be aggressively performed in the early stage when the maximum diameter of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in the descending aorta is 5 cm or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>(3) By paying adequate attention to patient education, outpatient follow-up using detailed diagnostic imaging, drug therapy, periodic late surveillance, expedition of scheduled surgery, and to the basic approach as well as endeavoring to improve surgical results by the use of new methods of treatment, it is anticipated that further improvement will be observed in late results </plain></SENT>
