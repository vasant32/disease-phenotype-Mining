<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We herein report 3 patients with CTD who underwent stent grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: : Case 1; A male Marfan patient was operated for thoraco-abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On computed tomography (CT), large false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> at the proximal anastomosis was documented which was excluded with a 30 mm Talent stent-graft with 10-15% oversize </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Case 2; A female with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e> had undergone resection of descending aortic thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> presented with an enlarging <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> distal to the graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three Talent stent-grafts (15% oversize) were deployed with balloon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> to exclude the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The immediate postoperative period was complicated by an extensive intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> of the descending aorta with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012151'>hemothorax</z:hpo>, managed conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Case 3; A female Marfan patient had undergone Bentall procedure and mitral repair followed with resection of the proximal descending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three months later a false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> at the distal anastomosis was treated with a 24 mm Valiant stent-graft (30% oversize) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic dissection</z:hpo> distal to stent was documented on the early postoperative CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The dissected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> enlarged significantly with a type I distal endoleak during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly, the patient presented a class III <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> owing to a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The patient underwent a successful MVR and stent-graft explantation with replacement of the descending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: : Significant complications supervened when stent-grafts were deployed in native aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We thus recommend that deploying a stent-graft in a CTD diseased aorta should be considered a relative contraindication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In cases with prohibitive or high risk surgery, use of a stent-graft with minimal radial force and minimal oversizing without balloon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> should be considered </plain></SENT>
