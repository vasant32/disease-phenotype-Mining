<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors studies 154 cases of degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> which presented macroscopically with atrophic changes of the valve and sometimes with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and calcification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histologically, the essential abnormality was the finding of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37395">mucopolysaccharide</z:chebi> deposits dissociating the corpus spongiosa from the corpus fibrosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Depending on the importance of these lesions, three degrees of severity can be defined, the most extensive (84% of our patient population) appearing to be typical of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> (5%) and medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of the aortic wall (80% of patients undergoing aortic biopsy) were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These morphological features are on the whole quite different to those of other aortic valve pathologies (rheumatic, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the border line with other pathologies with a similar anatomopathological substratum is less clearly defined: genetic abnormalities (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023931" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lobstein's disease</z:e>, etc...) or age-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1285162" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">degenerative disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis is not clearly understood but could be related to regional disturbances in collagen metabolism with collagenolysis predominating </plain></SENT>
