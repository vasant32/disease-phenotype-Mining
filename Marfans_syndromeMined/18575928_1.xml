<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>Fatigue</z:mp>, a common complaint of these patients, is also related to orthostatic intolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment with beta-blockers, to prevent aortic complications, could be a reinforcing factor of both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate (1) the relationship between symptoms of orthostatic tolerance and in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and (2) whether termination of beta-blocker therapy improves orthostatic tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptoms of <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> and orthostatic complaints were assessed in 49 subjects using questionnaires (MFI-20 and Autonomic Symptoms Profile) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Marfan patients have a high level of <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> and orthostatic complaints when compared to the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>Fatigue</z:mp> and orthostatic tolerance are significantly correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Orthostatic tolerance was assessed in 9 additional subjects by an active-standing test and head-up tilt for 5 minutes, and 24 hours blood pressure monitoring, once during beta-blocker therapy and once after ceasing beta-blockers for 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During hemodynamic testing Marfan patients frequently showed Initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>Orthostatic Hypotension</z:hpo> and an abnormally high initial heart rate response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ceasing beta-blockers did not affect the initial blood pressure response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> are fatigued and have low orthostatic tolerance, which are significantly correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients could be educated in physical counterpressure maneuvers to increase orthostatic tolerance </plain></SENT>
