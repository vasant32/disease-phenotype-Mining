<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fibrillins form the core of these multicomponent assemblies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Various human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e>, the fibrillinopathies, arise from mutations in fibrillins and are frequently associated with aberrant microfibril assembly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These disorders include <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265313" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Weill-Marchesani syndrome</z:e>, Beals syndrome, and others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although homotypic and heterotypic fibrillin self-interactions are considered to provide critical initial steps, the detailed mechanisms for microfibril assembly are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show here that the C-terminal recombinant half of fibrillin-1 assembles into <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi>-bonded multimeric globular structures with peripheral arms and a dense core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These globules are similar to the beaded structures observed in microfibrils isolated from tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only these C-terminal fibrillin-1 multimers interacted strongly with the fibrillin-1 N terminus, whereas the monomers showed very little self-interaction activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The multimers strongly inhibited microfibril formation in cell culture, providing evidence that these recombinant assemblies can also interact with endogenous fibrillin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The C-terminal self-interaction site was fine-mapped to the last three calcium-binding EGF domains in fibrillin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a new mechanism for microfibril formation where fibrillin-1 first oligomerizes via its C terminus before the partially or fully assembled bead-like structures can further interact with other beads via the fibrillin-1 N termini </plain></SENT>
