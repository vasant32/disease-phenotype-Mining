<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of fibrillin 1, which was initially thought to be mainly structural, has been shown to also be functional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The altered transforming growth factor β pathway is better understood, the importance of epigenetic factors has been demonstrated and recent data suggest that many of the observations made in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> can actually be made in thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> from diverse aetiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Besides transforming growth factor β, the role of metalloproteinase, the fibrinolytic/coagulation system, is being suggested in the progression of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A relationship between the type of fibrillin 1 (FBN1) gene mutation and the mechanism for the disease (haplo-insufficiency vs negative dominance), as well as some genotype/phenotype correlations, has been observed, although the main challenge of recognising gene modifiers has yet to explain tremendous variability despite similar mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This progress has led to new hopes for tomorrow's therapies, some of which are being tested in clinics, whereas others are still in the field of animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here we review some of the new data obtained in the understanding of the pathophysiology and genetics of this disease </plain></SENT>
