<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To simplify extensive primary repair of the thoracic aorta in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, we developed the open triple-branched stent graft placement technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The early results of this new technique are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Between June 2008 and November 2009, 30 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> Stanford type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> underwent extensive primary repair of the thoracic aorta by means of ascending aorta replacement combined with open placement of triple-branched stent graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Placement of the triple-branched stent graft into the true lumen of the descending aorta, arch, and 3 arch vessels was technically successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean cardiopulmonary bypass time, aortic cross-clamp time, and lower body arrest time were 151.8 ± 16.69, 84.1 ± 6.97, and 31.17 ± 5.34 minutes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The postoperative mechanical ventilation support period and duration of intensive care unit stay were 17.93 ± 2.35 and 62.10 ± 9.24 hours, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> implanted stent grafts were fully opened and not kinked; there was no space or blood flow surrounding the triple-branched stent graft and no sidearm graft stenosis or occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The false lumen of the descending aorta distal to the stent graft closed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in 25 of 30 patients at their first postoperative scans and in 26 of 30 at the 3-month postoperative scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Open triple-branched stent graft placement is an effective technique with satisfactory early results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With this technique, extensive primary repair of the thoracic aorta may become easier and safer for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
