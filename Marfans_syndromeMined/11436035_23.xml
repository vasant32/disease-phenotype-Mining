<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To review the late results of valve-sparing operations in patients with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From May 1988 to June 2000, 120 patients with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and 68 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> underwent aortic valve-sparing operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> were younger, were predominantly male, and had less severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> than patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo>, who were older and often had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the transverse arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight patients with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> had the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> was similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reconstruction of the aortic root was performed by reimplanation of the aortic valve in 64 patients and by remodeling of the aortic root in 56 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> were treated by replacement of the ascending aorta with reduction in the diameter of the sinotubular junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Approximately two thirds of the latter patients also required replacement of the transverse aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 35 +/- 31 months for patients with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and 26 +/- 23 months for those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 2 operative and 5 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in patients with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and 1 operative and 9 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival for patients with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was 88% +/- 4% and for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo>, 68% +/- 12% (P =.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> developed in 2 patients, and they required aortic valve reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 5-year freedom from aortic valve reoperation was 99% +/- 1% for patients with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and 97% +/- 4% for those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> at the latest echocardiographic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The 5-year freedom from severe or moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> was 90% +/- 4% in patients who had aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and 98% +/- 2% in those who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aortic valve-sparing operations have provided excellent clinical outcomes and few valve-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The function of the reconstructed aortic root remains unchanged in most patients during the first 5 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
