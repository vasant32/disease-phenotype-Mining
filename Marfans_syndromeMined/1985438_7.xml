<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical, cardiac, and echocardiographic test results of 20 children with marfanoid features are reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifteen were diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, two had "possible" <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and three had other diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On first evaluation, eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (53%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> and none had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography showed aortic root enlargement in 12 (80%) of 15 patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> in 12 (80%) of 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> echocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At follow-up examination, one patient had developed aortic root enlargement, and one patient, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, although aortic root enlargement is usually present in early childhood in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, it is not considered specific because in this study it also occurred in one child with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1567741" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Alport's syndrome</z:e> and in one with marfanoid features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients with aortic root enlargement were treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> and their echocardiograms showed no further increase in the aortic root diameter for several years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We recommend echocardiography in the diagnosis and routine management of children in whom <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is suspected </plain></SENT>
