<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Advances in treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (CHD) have resulted in most patients surviving to adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite surgical "correction," the need for reoperation(s) persists, and there are few outcome data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined early postoperative results to determine risk factors for cardiac injury and early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in adults with CHD undergoing repeat median sternotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from the most recent median sternotomy of 984 adults (49% male) with CHD were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean age at operation was 36.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses were conotruncal anomaly, 361 (37%); Ebstein/Tricuspid valve, 174 (18%); <z:hpo ids='HP_0001642'>pulmonary stenosis</z:hpo>/right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, 92 (9%); <z:hpo ids='HP_0001750'>single ventricle</z:hpo>, 71 (7%); <z:hpo ids='HP_0006695'>atrioventricular septal defect</z:hpo>, 64 (7%); <z:hpo ids='HP_0001682'>subaortic stenosis</z:hpo>, 62 (6%); <z:mp ids='MP_0004113'>aortic arch abnormalities</z:mp>, 23 (2%); anomalous pulmonary vein, 21 (2%); <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, 14 (1%); and other, 102 (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall early mortality was 3.6%: including 2%, 6%, 7%, and 0% at sternotomy 2 (n=597), 3 (n=284), 4 (n=72), and 5+ (n=31), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cardiac injury occurred in 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors of cardiac injury were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001750'>single-ventricle</z:hpo> diagnosis and increased number of prior sternotomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased time from previous sternotomy decreased the incidence of cardiac injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Independent risk factors for early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were urgent operation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001750'>single-ventricle</z:hpo> diagnosis, and longer bypass time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Increased preoperative ejection fraction decreased early mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Subsequent sternotomy showed increased early mortality, yet neither sternotomy number nor cardiac injury was an independent predictor of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two variables were protective: early mortality was reduced with increased ejection fraction and cardiac injury was less likely with increased interval from the previous sternotomy </plain></SENT>
