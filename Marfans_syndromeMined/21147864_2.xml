<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Up until now, this portion of the aorta has not been well studied but is gaining importance due to improved patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We report a retrospective cohort of 100 Marfan patients who survived an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dissection occurred in either the ascending aorta (AscAo) (n = 37), the descending aorta (DescAo) (n = 20), or both (As + DescAo, n = 43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 9.8 Â± 6.0 years (complete for 88% of the patients), 17 patients died and 52 had a clinical event (new <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, surgery, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, haemorrhage), 60% of which involved the descending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Event-free survival was similar whatever the location of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, a better event-free survival was observed when no dissected portion of the aorta remained after surgery, which was the case in 62% (23/37) of the AscAo patients (30% incurred an event vs. 86%; P = 0.008 by log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the diameter of the ascending aorta was below the surgical threshold in 60% of the patients who incurred a dissection of the descending aorta, and within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The descending aorta may dissect whatever the diameter of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The descending aorta is the location of most late clinical events after any dissection of the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rate of clinical events is much lower when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the dissected aorta has been removed in patients with AscAo dissection </plain></SENT>
