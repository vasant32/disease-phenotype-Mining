<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Real time 3D echocardiography is a simple, non-invasive method which, by a biplane mode, allows measurement of the 3 sinuses of Valsalva </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to compare the 2D and 3D echocardiographic methods for measuring the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients (average age 12 +/- 8 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> were studied prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The maximal 3D diameter was significantly greater than the 2D measurement (31.7 +/- 6.8 mm vs 29.9 +/- 6.6 mm, p&lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 4 patients, the difference was over 3 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diameter between the right coronary and left coronary sinus was greater than the two others (right coronary-non coronary and left coronary-non coronary) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The oldest 5 patients had an MRI aortic measurement very similar to that of 3D echocardiography (36.6 vs 36.7 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Real time 3D echocardiography in the biplane mode enables reliable and reproducible measurement of the aortic root in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Larger and multicenter studies are required to allow confirmation of the value of 3D echocardiography in the follow-up of these patients </plain></SENT>
