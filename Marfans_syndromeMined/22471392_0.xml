<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>Aortic dilatation</z:hpo> is the main therapeutic target in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Standard treatment with a β-blocker may not lower central pulse pressure - the major objective - because it does not do so in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, unlike <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium-channel blockers</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore performed a prospective, randomised, double-blind, crossover trial to compare the effects of these three agents on large artery function and central aortic pressure in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighteen patients had applanation tonometry, pulse wave analysis and echocardiography, before and after atenolol 75 mg, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi> 4 mg and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> 240 mg, each given for 4 weeks, in a random order, with 2 weeks between medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within-drug comparisons demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi> (-10·3 mmHg, P = 0·002), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> (-9·2 mmHg, P = 0·003) and atenolol (-7·1 mmHg, P = 0·01) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> reduced central systolic pressure and brachial pressure; central changes were least, and peripheral changes greatest with atenolol but between-drug comparisons (analysis of covariance) were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a trend for augmentation to be reduced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi> (-6·3%, P = 0·05), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> (-5·5%, P = 0·07) and atenolol (-3·2%, P = 0·09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only atenolol <z:mp ids='MP_0005333'>reduced heart rate</z:mp> (by 16%) and delayed expansion in the arch and abdominal aorta (by 8% and 11%) (P &lt; 0·001, P &lt; 0·01 and P &lt; 0·05, respectively, for between-drug comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">Perindopril</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> and atenolol <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> reduced peripheral and central systolic pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As atenolol slowed heart rate and delayed aortic wave travel, β-blockade may have a continuing role in the treatment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
