<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine predictors of long-term stability of the aortic valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 430 patients (aged 57 ± 15 years, 323 male) underwent valve-preserving aortic root surgery (remodeling in 401, reimplantation in 29) between 1995 and 2009 and were followed echocardiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Factors influencing late recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic valve regurgitation</z:hpo> grade II or greater (n = 45) or need for reoperation on the aortic valve (n = 25) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Early mortality was 2.8% (1.9% for elective cases), and actuarial survival at 10 years was 83.5% ± 2.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten-year freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic valve regurgitation</z:hpo> grade II or greater was 85.0% ± 2.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preoperative aortoventricular junction diameter greater than 28 mm and postoperative effective height of the aortic cusp less than 9 mm were identified as significant predictors for late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic valve regurgitation</z:hpo> grade II or greater in multivariate analysis (both P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten-year freedom from reoperation on the aortic valve was 89.3% ± 2.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preoperative aortoventricular junction diameter greater than 28 mm (P &lt; .001), use of pericardial patch (P = .022), and effective height of the aortic cusp less than 9 mm (P = .049) were identified as significant predictors for reoperation in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Operative technique (remodeling, reimplantation), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, bicuspid valve <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, concomitant central cusp plication, size of prosthesis used, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection were not associated with an increased risk of late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic valve regurgitation</z:hpo> grade II or greater or reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with preoperative aortoventricular junction diameter greater than 28 mm (n = 94), the addition of central cusp plication significantly improved freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic valve regurgitation</z:hpo> grade II or greater (P = .006) regardless of root procedures (remodeling, P = .011; reimplantation, P = .053) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long-term stability of valve-preserving aortic root replacement was influenced not by the technique of root repair but by the preoperative aortic root geometry and postoperative cusp configuration </plain></SENT>
