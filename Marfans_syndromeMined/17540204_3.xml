<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prior studies have identified specific clinical findings as being predictive of outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prognostic significance of specific findings on imaging studies is less well described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sought to identify the prognostic value of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in medically and surgically treated patients with AAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 522 AAD patients enrolled over 6 years in the International Registry of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic Dissection</z:hpo> who underwent TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified independent associations of inhospital mortality, first using clinical variables (model 1), after which TEE data were added to build a final model (model 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Inhospital mortality was 28.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiographic evidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> (P = .04), tamponade (P &lt; .01), periaortic <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> (P = .02), and patent false lumen (P = .08) were more frequent in nonsurvivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0010470'>Dilated ascending aorta</z:mp> (P = .03), dissection localized to the ascending aorta (P = .02), and thrombosed false lumen (P = .08) were less common in nonsurvivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Model 1 identified age &gt; or = 70 years, any pulse deficit, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>/shock as independent predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Model 2 identified dissection flap confined to ascending aorta (odds ratio 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.6) and complete <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of false lumen (odds ratio 0.15, 95% CI 0.03-0.86) as protective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the medically treated group, mortality was 31% for subjects with a partially or completely thrombosed false lumen versus 66% in the presence of a patent false lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transesophageal echocardiography provides prognostic information in AAD beyond that provided by clinical risk variables </plain></SENT>
