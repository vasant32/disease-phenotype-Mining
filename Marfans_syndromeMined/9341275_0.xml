<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 23-year-old man with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, who had annulo-aortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> of type I, was successfully treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He underwent one-stage replacement of the entire thoracic aorta using a retrograde pull-through technique with aortic valve sparing reimplantation (David procedure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The descending aorta was replaced with a Hemashield graft, and then the graft was passed through within the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004954'>descending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> in the retrograde fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, the graft was inserted inside the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004954'>descending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> without ligation of some of the intercostal arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postoperative MRI showed complete clotting of the space between the graft and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>David's reimplantation procedure which spares own aortic valve, requires no <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy in the post operative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> nor pressure gradient between the left ventricle and the aorta were observed postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the replacement of the entire thoracic aorta using a retrograde pull-through technique with an aortic valve sparing reimplantation by the single stage is useful for the selected patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the entire thoracic aorta and annulo-aortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
