<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examines the relationship between the FBN1 genotype and phenotype in families with extremely mild phenotypes and in those that show striking clinical variation among apparently affected individuals </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In another, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001442'>somatic mosaicism</z:hpo> for a mutant FBN1 allele is associated with subdiagnostic manifestations, whereas germ-line transmission of the identical mutation causes severe and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapidly progressive</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A third family cosegregates mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> syndrome with a mutation in FBN1 that can be functionally distinguished from those associated with the classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> phenotype </plain></SENT>
