<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few communications have reported the long-term results and none with a follow-up of more than 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This article reports our results in a series of 145 patients operated on for congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral valve insufficiency</z:hpo> by means of the same technique (Carpentier's technique) in a single center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1970 and 1995, 145 patients younger than 12 years old underwent surgery for congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral valve insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 5.7 +/- 3.1 years, ranging from 0.17 to 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>Mitral valve insufficiency</z:hpo> associated with atrioventricular defect, atrioventricular discordance, straddling mitral valve, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277564" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">acquired diseases</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1285162" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">degenerative disease</z:e> was excluded from this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to Carpentier classification, 31 patients had type I <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264765,C0026265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral valve disease</z:e> (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> leaflet motion), 79 patients type II (leaflet <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath>), and 35 type III (restricted leaflet motion), with 15 having <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> papillary muscles and 20 abnormal papillary muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Associated lesions were present in 51 patients (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A conservative operation was possible in 138 patients (95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among them, 70 patients required a prosthetic annuloplasty and 21 patients valve extension with a pericardial patch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Valve replacement was necessary in seven patients (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In-hospital mortality was 5% (95% CL: 2.5% to 9.9%) (seven patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was observed in the group of patients who underwent valvular replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In-hospital mortality was as follows: type I, 9.6%; type II, 2.5%; and type III, 13% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant difference was noted among patients with the different types of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 9.3 +/- 6.9 years (1 to 26 years), and cumulative follow-up was 1142 patient-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Ten late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival at 10 years was 88% in patients who underwent valve repair and 51% in patients who underwent valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Late reoperation was required in 15% (n = 21) of patients who had undergone valve repair and 28% (n = 2) in patients with valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Causes of reoperation were recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023212" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">left ventricular failure</z:e> (n = 1), residual or recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral valve insufficiency</z:hpo> (n = 17), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral valve stenosis</z:hpo> (n = 3), and calcification of the bioprosthesis (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>No failure resulting from leaflet extension was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In the repair group, actuarial freedom from reoperation was 68% (95% CL: 80.5% to 51.5%) at 15 years, and the linearized rate of exposure to reoperation was 1.9% per patient-year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>No thromboembolic event was observed in any group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral valve insufficiency</z:hpo> can be repaired in infancy with a low mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Conservative surgery with Carpentier's techniques is feasible in the majority of cases of congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral valve insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>This technique offers stable long-term results with a low rate of reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Leaflet extension associated with prosthetic ring annuloplasty could prevent reoperations in selected cases </plain></SENT>
