<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011003'>High myopia</z:hpo> in early childhood is a recognised association of ocular and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to describe the types, pattern and frequency of these associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children presenting to two ophthalmology units over 3 years who were found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0011003'>high myopia</z:hpo> were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011003'>High myopia</z:hpo> was defined as one or both eyes demonstrating 6 dioptres spherical equivalent or more of myopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">refractive error</z:e> on retinoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We limited the age to less than 10 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A retrospective case review was undertaken of the 112 consecutive children who fulfilled the criteria above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The demographic data, source and indication for referral were recorded along with the ocular and systemic findings and diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only 9 (8%) of the children had 'simple <z:hpo ids='HP_0011003'>high myopia</z:hpo>' with no associated ocular or systemic associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 54% there was an underlying systemic association with or without further ocular problems (e.g. <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e>, Marfan, Stickler, Noonan, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e>) and in the remaining 38% there were further ocular problems associated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011003'>high myopia</z:hpo> (e.g. <z:hpo ids='HP_0001132'>lens subluxation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000589'>coloboma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000556'>retinal dystrophy</z:hpo>, anisometropic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000646'>amblyopia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011003'>high myopia</z:hpo> did not preclude associated abnormality: in 4 cases the diagnosis of a systemic condition in the child led to the identification of the disease in at least one myopic relative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Asian (p &lt; 0.001) and male (p &lt; 0.05) patients were overrepresented in the series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011003'>High myopia</z:hpo> is strongly associated with systemic and ocular problems; it may be the reason for the child's initial medical referral and an important clue to an underlying systemic or ocular condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Referrals infrequently originated from community optometrists despite prior attendance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children under 10 years of age with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011003'>high myopia</z:hpo> are referred to a paediatric ophthalmology clinic for review and we propose a structured clinical evaluation in the hospital eye clinic </plain></SENT>
