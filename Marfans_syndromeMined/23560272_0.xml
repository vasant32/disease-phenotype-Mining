<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The existing criteria and recommendations on how and when to surgically approach this disease is almost exclusively confined to the root and ascending aorta, in contrast to the variability of indications on the involvement of the remaining segments of the thoracic and abdominal aorta, due to the multiplicity, <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and topography of these involvements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This case report is related to a 39 year old woman with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, with a type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection and a segmentar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the proximal descending thoracic aorta with 6,1cm of maximum diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical and imagiologic evaluation pointed out the absence of any disorder of the heart, root or ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient underwent surgical management of the dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> through a transthoracic approach to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, with fenestration of the distal aorta and exclusion of the aneurism and intercostal arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The efficacy and result of the procedure in addition to the rarity of the vascular pathology presented by the patient, even in the context of a Marfan, completely justify the presentation and disclosure of this clinical case </plain></SENT>
