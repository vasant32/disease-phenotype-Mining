<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some risk factor such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is well known in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the role of genetic factors in AD is largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e>; patients with D allele have higher serum and tissue ACE levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship between the I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene and non-syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients diagnosed with AD were included in the study (mean age: 60.1 +/- 6.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was established by clinical evaluation and imaging techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The control group consisted of 22 age-matched patients without AD (60.9 +/- 7.3 years), who suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was similar in dissection and control groups (62% vs. 59%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The I/D polymorphism was investigated in both groups by PCR analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Dissection types according to the DeBakey classification were identified as type 1 (proximal + distal) in 7 patients (43%), type 2 (proximal) in 5 patients (31%), and type 3 (distal) in 4 patients (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The D/D and D/I polymorphisms are present in 13 and 3 AD patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>None of patients with AD have the II polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of the D allele (DD + ID) are significantly higher in dissection group than control (100% vs. 68%, P &lt; 0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the D allele of ACE gene is a risk factor for AD </plain></SENT>
