<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From July 2003 to Dec 2007, 22 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> were treated by aortic valve preservation and root reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 12 male and 10 female, the age ranged from 10 to 57 years old with a mean of (28 +/- 10) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The operation procedures included reimplantation technique in 9 patients, remodeling technique in 8 patients, and patch technique in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, reimplantation technique + total aorta replacement in 1 patient, remodeling technique + "aortic arch replacement + stent-elephant trunk" in 1 patient, patch technique + "aortic arch replacement + stent-elephant trunk" in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were followed-up by 17 to 64 months with a mean of (46 +/- 16) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No in-hospital and follow-up period <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was one reexploration for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> 1 d postoperative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No valve-related complication occurred during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the end of follow-up, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> was demonstrate in 16 patients, but mild regurgitation in 4 patients, moderate regurgitation in 1 patient and severe regurgitation in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients with moderate and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> need reoperation 1 year postoperative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The early and mid-term results of aortic valve preservation and root reconstruction operations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> were favorable </plain></SENT>
