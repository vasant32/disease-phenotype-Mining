<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the molecular pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> was attributed initially to a structural <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of the fibrillin-rich microfibrils within the extracellular matrix, more recent results have documented that many of the pathogenic abnormalities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> are the result of alterations in TGFβ signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in FBN1 are therefore associated with increased activity and bioavailability of TGF-β1, which is suspected to be the basis for phenotypical similarities of FBN1 mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and mutations in the receptors for TGFβ in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan-syndrome</z:e>-related diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated that unique skeletal phenotypes observed in human embryonic stem cells carrying the monogenic FBN1 mutation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> cells) are faithfully phenocopied by cells differentiated from induced pluripotent-stem cells (MFSiPS) derived independently from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patient fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we aimed to determine further the biochemical features of transducing signaling(s) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> stem cells and MFSiPS cells highlighting a cross-talk between TGFβ and BMP signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results revealed that enhanced activation of TGFβ signaling observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> cells decreased their endogenous BMP signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, exogenous BMP antagonized the enhanced TGFβ signaling in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> stem cells and MFSiPS cells therefore, rescuing their ability to undergo osteogenic differentiation </plain></SENT>
