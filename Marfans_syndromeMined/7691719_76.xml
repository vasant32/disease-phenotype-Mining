<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is a large cysteine-rich <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> with extensive intrachain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bonds, likely contributed by multiple EGF-like repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously published 6.9 kb of FBN1 cDNA sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FBN1 cDNA clones that extend the sequence 3089 bp in the 5' direction are described in this report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The deduced primary structure suggests that fibrillin is composed of multiple domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most predominant feature is the presence of 43 calcium binding EGF-like repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate here that fibrillin molecules bind calcium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, three alternatively spliced exons at the 5' end are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of 5.8 kb of surrounding genomic sequence revealed a 1.8-kb CpG island spanning the alternatively spliced exons and the next downstream exon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since FBN1 is the gene responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, the information presented here will be useful in identifying new mutations and in understanding the function of fibrillin in the pathogenesis of the disease </plain></SENT>
