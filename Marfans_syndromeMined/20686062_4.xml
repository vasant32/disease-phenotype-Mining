<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004948'>vascular tortuosity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the musculoskeletal demographic, clinical, and imaging findings of this syndrome to aid in its diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the demographic, clinical, and imaging data of sixty-five patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome seen at one institution from May 2007 through December 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients had a mean age of twenty-one years, and thirty-six of the sixty-five patients were less than eighteen years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Previous diagnoses for these patients included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (sixteen patients) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e> (two patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spinal and foot abnormalities were the most clinically important skeletal findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001762'>talipes equinovarus</z:hpo>, and nineteen patients had cervical anomalies and instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> (mean Cobb angle [and standard deviation], 30 degrees +/- 18 degrees ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003302'>spondylolisthesis</z:hpo>, and twenty-two of thirty-three who had computed tomography scans had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo>, and eight had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000768'>pectus carinatum</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Combined thumb and wrist signs were present in approximately one-fourth of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Acetabular protrusion was present in approximately one-third of the patients and was usually mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had previous orthopaedic procedures, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> surgery, cervical stabilization, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001762'>clubfoot</z:hpo> correction, and hip arthroplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Features of Loeys-Dietz syndrome that are important clues to aid in making this diagnosis include bifid <z:hpo ids='HP_0010809'>broad uvulas</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000316'>hypertelorism</z:hpo>, substantial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001388'>joint laxity</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001201'>translucent skin</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome commonly present to the orthopaedic surgeon with cervical malformations, spinal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001760'>foot deformities</z:hpo>, and findings in the craniofacial and cutaneous systems </plain></SENT>
