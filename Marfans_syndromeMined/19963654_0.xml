<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Firstly, the dural sacs of 8 Marfan patients were segmented by applying an unsupervised Fuzzy C-Means method on T2-weighed magnetic resonance images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then, for each patient a tubular model of the dural sac was extracted by detecting and removing the existent pathological extrusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The segmented images together with the resulting tube were then rendered using a marching cubes algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proposed algorithm represents a first attempt to quantify and to morphologically characterize the pathological <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> that usually accompanies the Marfan disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The generated 3D reconstruction and the opportunity to overlap them with a physiological model provides the clinician with a tool for a panoramic view of the structures and a means for a more accurate inspection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition the extracted parameters furnish quantitative and reproducible measures that could be useful as discriminative indexes for an automatic and more objective diagnosis </plain></SENT>
