<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The preoperative pulmonary function test revealed severe obstructive and restrictive respiratory dysfunction, with forced expiratory volume in one second of 650 ml and vital capacity of 1,220 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These parameters improved after 4 months respiratory physiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A modified Bentall's procedure was performed after respiratory physiotherapy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lower limits of pulmonary function for open heart surgery have not been established clearly; however, our case will help elucidate these limits of respiratory function for open heart surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preoperative respiratory physiotherapy improved parameters of pulmonary function test and may decrease the morbidity of postoperative pulmonary complications in a patient with severe respiratory dysfunction </plain></SENT>
