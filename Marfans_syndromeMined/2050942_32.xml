<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The following formulas were used: 1) Aortic distensibility = 2(Changes in aortic diameter)/(Diastolic aortic diameter) (Pulse pressure); and 2) Aortic stiffness index = ln(Systolic blood pressure)/(Diastolic blood pressure)(Changes in aortic diameter)/Diastolic aortic diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pulse wave velocity was also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> had decreased aortic distensibility in the ascending and the abdominal aorta (2.9 +/- 1.3 vs. 5.6 +/- 1.4 cm2 dynes-1, p less than 0.001 and 4.5 +/- 2.1, vs. 7.7 +/- 2.5, cm2 dynes-1, p less than 0.001, respectively) and had an increased aortic stiffness index in the ascending and the abdominal aorta (10.9 +/- 5.6 vs. 5.9 +/- 2.2, p less than 0.005 and 7.1 +/- 3.1 vs. 3.9 +/- 1.2, p less than 0.005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aortic diameters in the ascending aorta were larger in these patients than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, but those in the abdominal aorta were similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Linear correlations for both aortic distensibility and stiffness index were found between the ascending and the abdominal aorta (r = 0.85 and 0.71, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pulse wave velocity was more rapid in the patients than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (11.6 +/- 2.5 vs. 9.5 +/- 1.4 m/s, respectively, p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, aortic elastic properties are abnormal in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> irrespective of the aortic diameter, which suggests an intrinsic abnormality of the aortic arterial wall </plain></SENT>
