<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study group included 170 patients referred to a specialist clinic, of whom 55 (age 26 +/- 12 years) were diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The remaining 115 patients (age 25 +/- 14 years) formed a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each patient underwent echocardiographic examination, with measurement of ascending aorta diameter at end-diastole and end-systole, and aortic flow velocities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The elastic properties of the aorta were indexed by calculation of aortic distensibility, wall stiffness, and systemic pulse wave velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean end-diastolic aortic diameter in the Marfan group (38 +/- 9 mm) was greater than that in the controls (26 +/- 4 mm, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Resting heart rate and aortic flow velocities were similar in the 2 groups, but systemic arterial pulse pressure was greater in the Marfan group (50 +/- 12 mm Hg) than in the controls (41 +/- 8 mm Hg, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aortic diameter increased with age in both groups, but at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages the Marfan group exhibited greater aortic diameters (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aortic distensibility was less in the Marfan group (2.6 +/- 1.3 cm2.dynes-1 x10(-6)) than in the controls (6.2 +/- 2.1 cm2.dynes-1 x 10(-6), p &lt; 0.01), and the aortic wall stiffness index was greater in the Marfan group (7.9 +/- 3.4) than in the controls (2.8 +/- 0.6, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aortic wall stiffness increased with age and aortic diameter, but at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages the Marfan group exhibited a stiffer aorta for a given diameter than did the controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
