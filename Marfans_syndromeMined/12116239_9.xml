<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a female patient who had a scalp <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo>, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000193'>cleft uvula</z:hpo>, an upper sternal defect, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001763'>pes planus</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001382'>joint hypermobility</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She had rupture of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> after minor trauma at 11 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 17 years of age, elective repair of a dilated, ectatic aorta was complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> in the proband included an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the left subclavian artery, atresia of the right carotid artery, and calcified <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We believe that the proband's physical anomalies are best described by the PHACE (posterior fossa brain malformations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo>, arterial anomalies, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001680'>coarctation of the aorta</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_92'>cardiac defects</z:mpath>, and eye abnormalities) phenotypic spectrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This spectrum of physical anomalies also includes sternal clefting and hemagiomas as part of the sternal malformation/<z:mp ids='MP_0001614'>vascular dysplasia</z:mp> (SM/VD) association, as found in our patient, and the acronym PHACES has also been used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We consider that the PHACE phenotypic spectrum is likely to be broader than previously recognized and includes orofacial clefting and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> and rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our patient also had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>skeletal anomalies</z:hpo> that lead to consideration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> as a diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It should be recognized that there is clinical overlap between PHACE syndrome and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> when <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> is present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We would also like to emphasize the minor nature of the cutaneous findings in our patient despite her severe vascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is in contrast to previous reports of large or multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo> in PHACE syndrome </plain></SENT>
