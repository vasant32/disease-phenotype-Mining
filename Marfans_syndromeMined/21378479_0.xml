<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He was diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> by clinical findings at the age of 2 years, and the diagnosis was confirmed by the detection of gene mutation in FBN1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He was referred to our hospital because of the swelling of cervical lymph nodes at the age of 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Findings on bone marrow examination demonstrated T lymphoblastic ALL </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He has remained in continuous complete remission for 34 months following diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, only three cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> were reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We speculate that increased activity of TGF-Î², which is known as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor factor, in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> may diminish the risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, although such a thesis was not proven in this case </plain></SENT>
