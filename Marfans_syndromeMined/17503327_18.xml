<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A promising strategy for identifying disease susceptibility genes for both single- and multiple-gene diseases is to search patients' autosomes for shared chromosomal segments derived from a common ancestor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such segments are characterized by the distinct identity of their haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The methods and algorithms currently available have only a limited capability for determining a high-resolution haplotype genomewide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We herein introduce the homozygosity haplotype (HH), a haplotype described by the homozygous SNPs that are easily obtained from high-density SNP genotyping data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The HH represents haplotypes of both copies of homologous autosomes, allowing for direct comparisons of the autosomes among multiple patients and enabling the identification of the shared segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The HH successfully detected the shared segments from members of a large family with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, which is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo>, single-gene disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It also detected the shared segments from patients with model multigene diseases originating with common ancestors who lived 10-25 generations ago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The HH is therefore considered to be useful for the identification of disease susceptibility genes in both single- and multiple-gene diseases </plain></SENT>
