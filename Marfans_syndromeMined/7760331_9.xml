<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rotary shadowing analysis of extracellular matrix produced by these cells revealed the presence of only a very few intact microfibrils which showed marked disorganisation within the interbeaded domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Metabolic pulse-chase studies identified intracellularly a population of truncated proFib molecules which were secreted more slowly than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> proFib derived from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Culture media contained strikingly reduced amounts of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> proFib in comparison to fibrillin (Fib) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings imply that (1) the truncated proFib is secreted and disturbs microfibril assembly; (2) the mutation is probably close to a putative cleavage site in the proFib C terminus necessary for the conversion of proFib to Fib; (3) the truncated proFib is over-N-glycosylated due to intracellular retention rather than incomplete cleavage of proFib with persistence of N-glycosylated sites; (4) not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> potential N-glycosylation sites in proFib seem to be normally used, since we could produce over-N-glycosylated proFib in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48080">brefeldin A</z:chebi> mediated intracellular captivation and subsequent appearance of over-glycosylated Fib in culture medium upon removal of the compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is conceivable that post-translational over-modification might be important for modulating the phenotype of FBN1 mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
