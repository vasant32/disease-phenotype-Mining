<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of the reported mutations are missense substitutions mainly affecting the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like protein domain structure and the calcium-binding (cb) site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to investigate the correlation between fibrillin-1 frameshift mutations and the clinical phenotype in patients affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 48 out of 66 Marfan patients a pathogenetic mutation was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We detected novel mutations causing premature termination codon in exons 19, 37, 40 and 41 of four Italian patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first mutation in exon 19 (cbEGF #8 domain) results in a clinical phenotype involving mainly the skeletal and cardiovascular systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we noticed that, while mutations in exons 37 and 41 (eight cysteine domains #4 and #5) are milder, the mutation in exon 40 (cbEGF #24 domain) is more severe and causes major cardiovascular involvement with thoracic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is noteworthy that the degree of the severity in the phenotype of one of our patients and another from the literature carrying a mutation in exon 41 could be explained with alterations in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
