<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in the literature, data on right ventricular and bi-atrial diastolic function are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate whether, in the absence of significant valvular disease, diastolic dysfunction is present not only in both ventricles but also in the atrial cavities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy-two adult unoperated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients and 73 controls without significant differences in age, sex, and body surface area from the patient group were studied using two-dimensional, pulsed, and colour-Doppler and tissue-Doppler imaging (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biventricular early filling measurements were significantly decreased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients when compared with controls (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pulsed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> early filling measurements obtained from five mitral annular regions and over the lateral tricuspid valve corner were significantly reduced in the patient group (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indices reflecting atrial function at the reservoir, conduit and contractile phases were also significantly decreased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated significant biventricular diastolic and biatrial systolic and diastolic dysfunction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> affects diastolic function independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diastolic abnormalities could be attributed to fibrillin-1 deficiency and dysregulation of transforming growth factor-beta activity in the cardiac extracellular matrix </plain></SENT>
