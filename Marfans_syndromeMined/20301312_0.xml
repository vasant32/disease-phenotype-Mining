<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LDSI and LDSII form a clinical continuum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The natural history of LDS is characterized by aggressive arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> 26.1 years) and high incidence of pregnancy-related complications including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100718'>uterine rupture</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of LDS is based on characteristic clinical findings in the proband and family members and molecular genetic testing of TGFBR1 and TGFBR2, the only two genes known to be associated with LDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Such testing is available on a clinical basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences in phenotype are observed between individuals with mutations in TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Important considerations when managing cardiovascular features of LDS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> occurs at smaller aortic diameters than observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> is not limited to the aortic root; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35530">beta-adrenergic blockers</z:chebi> or other medications are used to reduce hemodynamic stress; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are amenable to early and aggressive surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surgical fixation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010646'>cervical spine instability</z:hpo> may be necessary to prevent spinal cord damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Standard treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001762'>club feet</z:hpo> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001763'>pes planus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Standard treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>; management by a craniofacial team is preferred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prevention of secondary complications: Consider <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0006689'>bacterial endocarditis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SBE</z:e>) prophylaxis in those undergoing dental work or other procedures expected to contaminate the bloodstream with bacteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Surveillance: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> individuals with LDS require echocardiography at frequent intervals to monitor the status of the ascending aorta; the frequency of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computerized tomography angiography (CTA) evaluation depends on clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010646'>cervical spine instability</z:hpo> and severe or progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> should be followed by an orthopedist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Agents/circumstances to avoid: contact sports, competitive sports, and isometric exercise; agents that stimulate the cardiovascular system including routine use of decongestants; activities that cause joint injury or pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Testing of relatives at risk: If the causal TGFBR1 or TGFBR2 mutation is known in the proband, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify genetic status of family members at risk; if the mutation is not known, relatives at risk should be evaluated for signs of LDS, including echocardiography and extensive vascular imaging if findings suggest LDS or if findings were subtle in the index case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>GENETIC COUNSELING: LDS is inherited in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Approximately 25% of individuals diagnosed with LDS have an affected parent; approximately 75% of probands have LDS as the result of a de novo gene mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Each child of an individual with LDS has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation and the disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk for LDS is possible if the disease-causing mutation in the family is known </plain></SENT>
