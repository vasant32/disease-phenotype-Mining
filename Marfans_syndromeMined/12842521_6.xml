<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection who underwent either the remodeling (group 1, n = 21) or the reimplantation valve-sparing technique (group 2, n = 15) since October 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up clinically and echocardiographically for as long as 41.3 months (group 1) and 87 months (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hospital mortality was 19% (n = 4) for group 1 and 20% (n = 3) for group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Permanent new neurologic symptomatology occurred in 1 patient (3.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients in group 1 required reoperation owing to redissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patient had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> of more than grade 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No late neurologic or thrombembolic events occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference between both groups with respect to clinical and hemodynamic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Remodeling and reimplantation aortic valve-preserving operations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection can be performed with adequate perioperative risk and excellent midterm aortic valve function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found no evidence of one technique being superior to the other, however durability of the remodeling technique needs critical consideration especially in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and when glue is used </plain></SENT>
