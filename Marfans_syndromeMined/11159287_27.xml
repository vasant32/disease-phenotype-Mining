<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> were followed for a mean of 7.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Occurrence of adverse cardiovascular outcomes was measured clinically and by ultrasound examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>Mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> (MVP) was diagnosed in 46 patients at a mean age of 9.7 years, more than 80% of whom presented as "silent MVP" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>Mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) occurred in 25 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> in 43, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> (AR) in 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both MVP and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> developed at a constant rate during the age period 5-20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 23 patients MVP was diagnosed before <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo>, in 18 the reverse occurred, and in 11 patients the two abnormalities were diagnosed simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During follow up, 21 patients showed progression of mitral valve dysfunction; progression of aortic abnormalities occurred in 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aortic surgery was performed in 10; two died of subsequent complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mitral valve surgery was performed in six </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> female Marfan patients the age at initial diagnosis of MVP, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo>, and AR was lowest, the grade of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and AR most severe, the time lapse between the occurrence of MVP and subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> as well as between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and subsequent AR shortest, and the risk for cardiovascular associated morbidity and mortality highest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: During childhood and adolescence in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, mitral valve dysfunction as well as aortic abnormalities develop and progress gradually, often without symptoms, but may cause considerable morbidity and mortality by the end of the second decade, especially in female <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
