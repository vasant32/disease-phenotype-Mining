<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The protective effect of IF was estimated using the test of sister chromatid exchanges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Natural leucocyte alpha IF is highly effective in healthy human cells and in those of patients having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The latter are characterised by disorder in DNA repair under the action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16907">4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide</z:chebi> (4-NQO), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18358">8-methoxypsoralen</z:chebi> and gamma-rays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recombinant interferon (alpha 2) displayed no activity against gamma-rays in cells of healthy donors and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nor was it effective in the cells of patients in the experiments with 4-NQO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The absence of correlation between the ability of IF to protect the cells and their influence on the rate of cell proliferations was established </plain></SENT>
