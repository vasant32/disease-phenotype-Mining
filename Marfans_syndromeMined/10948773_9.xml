<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>With the increasing number of patients surviving after therapeutic intervention for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (CHD), accurate and frequent follow-up of their morphologic and functional cardiovascular status is required, preferably with a noninvasive imaging technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography, either transthoracic or transesophageal, has been the first choice for this purpose, and will probably keep that status, at least in a large segment of the CHD spectrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an established method for high-resolution visualization of cardiovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the past decade, newer MRI techniques have been developed that allow functional evaluation of CHD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Particularly the introduction of breath-hold imaging, contrast-enhanced MRA and user-friendly computer software for image analysis may move functional MRI of CHD from the science laboratory to clinical use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is already evident that MRI is superior to echocardiography in certain areas of limited echocardiographic access, such as the pulmonary artery branches and the aortic arch in adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>But MRI has also a unique potential for accurate volumetric analysis of ventricular function and cardiovascular blood flow, without any geometric assumptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If supported by increased cooperation between cardiologists and radiologists, MRI will grow into a useful noninvasive imaging tool that, together with echocardiography, will obviate the need for invasive catheter studies for diagnostic purposes </plain></SENT>
