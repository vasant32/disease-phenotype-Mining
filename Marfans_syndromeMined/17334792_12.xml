<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>With the advent of segmental pedicle screw fixation that enables more powerful corrective forces, it is postulated that an additional anterior procedure may be unnecessary even in severe deformities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the results of a posterior procedure alone using segmental pedicle screw fixation in severe scoliotic curves over 70 degrees  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> patients treated by pedicle screw fixation and rod derotation were retrospectively analyzed after a minimum follow-up of 2 years (range 2-10.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age of patients was 15.3 years (range 9.8-34.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses were idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> in 29, neuromuscular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> in 3 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>Scoliosis</z:hpo> consisted of single thoracic curve in 18, double thoracic in 5 and double major in 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients showed a major thoracic curve greater than 70 degrees (range 70-100), and different ten patients showed a major lumbar curve greater than 70 degrees (range 70-105), pre-operatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The deformity angle, lowest instrumented vertebral tilt (LIVT) and spinal balance were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pre-operatively there were nine patients with coronal decompensation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pre-operative thoracic curve of 80 +/- 9 degrees with the flexibility of 45 +/- 11% (45 +/- 11 degrees in side-bending film) was corrected to 27 +/- 10 degrees at the most recent follow-up, showing a correction of 66% (53 degrees) and loss of correction of 3.0% (3.7 degrees) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The pre-operative lumbar curve of 79 +/- 12 degrees with the flexibility of 62 +/- 14% (30 +/- 11 degrees in side-bending film) was corrected to 33 +/- 14 degrees at the most recent follow-up [59% (46 degrees) curve correction, 3.5% (3.0 degrees) loss of curve correction] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The pre-operative LIVT of 30 +/- 8 degrees was corrected to 11 +/- 6 degrees, showing a correction of 62% (19 degrees) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Residual coronal decompensation was observed in three patients postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Pre-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002942'>thoracic kyphosis</z:hpo> of 27 degrees (range 0-82) improved postoperatively to 31 degrees (range 14-53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, posterior segmental pedicle screw fixation without anterior release in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> had satisfactory deformity correction without significant loss of curve correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In this series a posterior procedure alone obviated the need for the anterior release and avoided complications related anterior surgery </plain></SENT>
