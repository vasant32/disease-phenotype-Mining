<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty patients (34 male, mean age 54.4 years) underwent redo thoracotomy for DTA (22 patients) or extended thoracoabdominal incision for reoperative TAAA (38 patients) from March 1988 to June 2007, after 1.7 +/- 0.9 previous cardioaortic procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-one patients were hypertensive (68%), 18 were smokers (30%), 9 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (15%), 9 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (15%), 5 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> (8%), and 3 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 45% (27 patients) had previous dissection, 30% (18) had atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, 15% had coarctation surgery (9), and 6 patients had other etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up, 100% complete, was 6.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hospital mortality for reoperative DTA/TAAA was 13.3% (8 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although 6.3 +/- 2.9 (0 to 14) segmental artery pairs were sacrificed at reoperation-and 6.2 +/- 2.3 (1 to 12) initially-for a total of 10.6 +/- 3.9 (2 to 15) segmental artery pairs sacrificed, only 1 patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> (1.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients had a 2-day procedure, with 12 to 24 hours of intensive care unit recovery after lysis of extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e>: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Respiratory complications occurred in 13 patients (21.6%), and permanent dialysis was required in 2 (3.3%), but there were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adverse outcome-1-year mortality, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, permanent dialysis, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo>-occurred in 13 patients (21.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adverse outcome was marginally associated (p &lt; 0.2) with increased age, atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (33% versus 17% other), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> incision (30% versus 9%), and greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> extent, and was significantly associated with perfusion technique (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Adverse outcome occurred in 3 of 4 patients who had clamp-and-sew technique, 6 of 21 using partial cardiopulmonary bypass (28.6%), and 3 of 17 with partial left heart bypass (17.7%), but only 1 of 18 with hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> (5.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reoperative DTA/TAAA repair was significantly safer with hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> rather than partial cardiopulmonary bypass, partial left heart bypass, or clamp-and-sew strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A 2-day procedure may be advisable for patients with extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
