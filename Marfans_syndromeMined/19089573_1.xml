<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To describe a Chinese patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who had a unique phenotype and a recurrent mutation in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE AND METHODS: A 31-year-old man who had a spontaneous bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>lens dislocation</z:hpo> into the vitreous cavity in childhood was found to have <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> and choroidal detachments in both eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pars plana vitrectomy, lensectomy, and <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> oil tamponade were performed on his right eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes of peripheral blood, and the 65 exons and flanking intronic sequences of the FBN1 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction for mutational screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A recurrent mutation, c.364C&gt;T was detected in exon 4 that resulted in p.Arg122Cys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The visual acuity of the right eye improved to 6/60 one year after the surgeries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: DNA screening helps in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> with unique phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mutation c.364C&gt;T can be considered to be a hotspot for Marfan patients with predominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
