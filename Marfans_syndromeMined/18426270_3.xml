<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To present midterm results after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e> focusing on secondary endoleak and reintervention due to disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 1997 and January 2007, 167 patients received 241 thoracic aortic stent-grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (6 men; median age 48 years, range 32-67) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e> (6 Marfan and 2 Ehlers-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Danlos</z:e> syndrome) treated with stent-graft repair were retrospectively analyzed at a median follow-up of 31 months (range 3-79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surveillance included postoperative computed tomographic angiography and/or magnetic resonance imaging exams prior to discharge, at 3, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Technical success of endovascular placement was 88% due to 1 primary type I endoleak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, and there have been no conversions to open surgery so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Perioperative complications occurred in 2 (25%) of the 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endoleaks were observed in 3 patients (primary type I, secondary type I, and type II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reintervention rate was 38% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Progression of disease resulting in de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> or aortic expansion occurred in 4 (50%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seven (88%) patients are alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no disease- or procedure-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TEVAR in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e> is feasible but still questionable regarding their young age and the rates of endoleaks and reintervention due to disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Close surveillance is mandatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Low morbidity and mortality rates may justify TEVAR in emergencies as a "bridging" method </plain></SENT>
