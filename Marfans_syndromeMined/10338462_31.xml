<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relationships between aortic PP, aortic stiffness, and aortic root dilation have not been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our main objective was to determine whether central PP, which takes into account wave reflections and aortic stiffness, is a better determinant of ascending aorta diameter than brachial PP in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty patients with confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and 20 age- and sex-matched control subjects were included in this cross-sectional, noninvasive study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elastic properties of the abdominal aorta and common carotid, common femoral, and radial arteries were calculated from the pulsatile changes in arterial diameter and pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ascending aorta diameter, measured with conventional echocardiography, was 37% larger in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> than in control subjects (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Arterial distensibility was 38% lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> than in control subjects at the site of the abdominal aorta (P&lt;0.01) but not at other sites (common carotid, common femoral, and radial arteries) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Independently of age and body surface area, ascending aorta diameter was positively correlated with carotid PP in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> (P&lt;0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>01) and negatively in control subjects (P&lt;0.01) but was not correlated with brachial PP and mean blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, local PP, estimated from carotid PP, was a major determinant of ascending aorta diameter, whereas brachial PP was not </plain></SENT>
