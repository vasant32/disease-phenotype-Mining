<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 35-year-old male with Marfan-like phenotype complained of a progressive increase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo> during the previous 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ophthalmologic exploration showed a bilateral subluxation of the lens with inferior and nasal displacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biochemical study detected a profile of increased amino acid levels (homocysteinemia) consistent with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vascular and skeletal studies ruled out <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Response to treatment demonstrated B(6)-non-responsive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Molecular study showed compound heterozygous T353 N and D444 N mutations of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17755">cystathionine</z:chebi> beta-synthase (CBS) gene, and also a C667T homozygous mutation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi>-reductase (MTHFR) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Family study showed classical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo> in his father and sister, although they did not present any systemic or ocular features of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>Homocystinuria</z:hpo> is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disease</z:e> usually presenting at an early age as vascular, skeletal and neuropsychiatric abnormalities, as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our case is atypical because of the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and the mild phenotype, in spite of being B(6)-non-responsive, and the association of a rare compound heterozygous mutation of the CBS gene and also an homozygous mutation of the MTHFR gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is necessary to rule out <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo>, even in the absence of systemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
