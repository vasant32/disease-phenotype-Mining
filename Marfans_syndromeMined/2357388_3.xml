<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between January 1970 and December 1988, 133 patients were operated upon for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the same period, 22 patients underwent 26 reoperations for recurrent or evolving dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven (50%) patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
