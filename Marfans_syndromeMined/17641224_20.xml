<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> is characterized by degradation of elastic fiber, suggesting the involvement of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9, the activation of which is regulated by TIMP (tissue inhibitor of MMP) types 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that MMP-2 and -9 were upregulated during <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> formation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, causing loss of elastic fibers and structural integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied mice, from 3 to 12 months, heterozygous for a mutant Fbn1 allele encoding a cysteine substitution in fibrillin-1 (Fbn1(C1039G/+), designated as "Marfan" mice) (n=120), the most common class of mutation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The littermates, Fbn1(+/+) served as controls (n=120) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Marfan aneurysmal thoracic aorta, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression of MMP-2 and -9 were detected at 3 months and peaked at 6 months of age, accompanied by severe elastic fiber fragmentation and degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From 3 to 9 months, the MMP-2/TIMP-2 ratio increased by 43% to 63% compared with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dilated thoracic aorta demonstrated increased elasticity but distention caused a pronounced loss of contraction, suggesting weakening of the aortic wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Breaking stress of the aneurysmal aorta was 70% of the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Contraction in response to depolarization and receptor stimulation decreased in the aneurysmal thoracic aorta by 50% to 80%, but the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin between the 2 strains was not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This report demonstrates the upregulation of MMP-2 and -9 during <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> formation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The resulting elastic fiber degeneration with deterioration of the aortic contraction and mechanical properties may explain the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
