<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two professional athletes in the US National Basketball Association required surgery for aortic root dilation in 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cases have attracted attention in sports medicine to the importance of aortic root disease in athletes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to aortic root dilation, other forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> include anomalous coronary artery, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this review, electronic database literature searches were performed using the terms "aortic root" and "athletes." The literature search produced 122 manuscripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, 22 were on aortic root dilation, 21 on anomalous coronary arteries, 12 on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valves</z:hpo>, and 8 on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aortic root dilation is a condition involving pathologic dilation of the aortic root, which can lead to life-threatening sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of the condition among athletes and higher risk athletes in particular sports needs to be better delineated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Normative parameters for aortic root diameter in the general population are proportionate to anthropomorphic variables, but this has not been validated for athletes at the extremes of anthropomorphic indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although echocardiography is the favored screening modality, computed tomography (CT) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are also used for diagnosis and surgical planning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Medical management has utilized beta-blockers, with more recent use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor blockers (ARBs), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Indications for surgery are based on comorbidities, degree of dilation, and rate of progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Management decisions for aortic root dilation in athletes are nuanced and will benefit from the development of evidence-based guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Anomalous coronary artery is another form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> with relevance in athletes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis has traditionally been through cardiac catheterization, but more recently has included evaluation with echocardiography, multislice CT, and MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Athletes with this condition should be restricted from participation in competitive sports, but can be cleared for participation 6 months after surgical repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>Bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> is another form of aortic root disease with significance in athletes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Although echocardiography has traditionally been used for diagnosis, CT and MRI have proven more sensitive and specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> consists of surveillance through echocardiography, medical therapy with beta-blockers and ARBs, and surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Guidelines for sports participation are based on the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, and aortic root dilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorder</z:e> with a number of cardiac manifestations including aortic root dilation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, and dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Medical management involves beta-blockers and ARBs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Thresholds for surgical management differ from the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>With regard to sports participation, the most important consideration is early detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Athletes with the stigmata of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> or with family history should be tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Further research should determine whether more aggressive screening is warranted in sports with taller athletes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Athletes with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> should be restricted from activities involving collision and heavy contact, avoid isometric exercise, and only participate in activities with low intensity, low dynamic, and low static components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In summary, many forms of aortic root disease afflict athletes and need to be appreciated by sports medicine practitioners because of their potential to lead to tragic but preventable <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in an otherwise healthy population </plain></SENT>
