<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LTBPs interact with fibrillins and other ECM components and thus function to localize latent TGF-β in the ECM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LAP contains an integrin-binding site (RGD), and several RGD-binding integrins are able to activate latent TGF-β through binding this site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutant mice defective in integrin-mediated activators, and humans and mice with fibrillin gene mutations, show the critical role of ECM and integrins in regulating TGF-β signaling </plain></SENT>
