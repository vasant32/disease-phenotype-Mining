<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical care is complicated by variable age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and the wide range of severity of aortic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The factors that modulate phenotypical severity, both among and within families, remain to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The availability of international FBN1 mutation Universal Mutation Database (UMD-FBN1) has allowed us to perform the largest collaborative study ever reported, to investigate the correlation between the FBN1 genotype and the nature and severity of the clinical phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A range of qualitative and quantitative clinical parameters (skeletal, cardiovascular, ophthalmologic, skin, pulmonary, and dural) was compared for different classes of mutation (types and locations) in 1,013 probands with a pathogenic FBN1 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A higher probability of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> was found for patients with a missense mutation substituting or producing a cysteine, when compared with other missense mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with an FBN1 premature termination codon had a more severe skeletal and skin phenotype than did patients with an inframe mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutations in exons 24-32 were associated with a more severe and complete phenotype, including younger age at diagnosis of type I fibrillinopathy and higher probability of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo>, ascending <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo>, aortic surgery, mitral valve abnormalities, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, and shorter survival; the majority of these results were replicated even when cases of neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These correlations, found between different mutation types and clinical manifestations, might be explained by different underlying genetic mechanisms (dominant negative versus haploinsufficiency) and by consideration of the two main physiological functions of fibrillin-1 (structural versus mediator of TGF beta signalling) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Exon 24-32 mutations define a high-risk group for cardiac manifestations associated with severe prognosis at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages </plain></SENT>
