<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A heterozygous deletion of a single base (A4704) from exon 37 of the fibrillin-1 gene was defined in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and subsequently in his previously undiagnosed father </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The deletion created a cryptic 5' splice site in exon 37 which was utilised in preference to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 5' splice site during pre-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> processing in skin fibroblasts cultured from the proband </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mutant <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> showed a 48-bp deletion from the 3' end of exon 37 which was predicted to restore the reading frame in the mutant <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and result in the deletion of a 16-amino-acid sequence from a central eight-cysteine repeat motif of the fibrillin-1 molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the cryptic 5' splice site in exon 37 and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 5' splice site had equally strong consensuses for splice-site selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The preferential utilisation of the cryptic site is discussed in relation to current theories on the mechanisms involved in pre-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> splicing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis by reverse-transcription PCR indicated that, in the patients skin fibroblasts, the steady-state level of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">mis</z:e>-spliced mutant <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was close to that from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, evidence from immunoblotting and pulse-chase biosynthetic labelling indicated that close to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> amounts of fibrillin-1 were being synthesised and secreted by the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in contrast to control cells cultured from an unaffected individual, little fibrillin-1 was detected, either biosynthetically or by immunofluorescence, in the extracellular matrix produced by the proband's fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the slightly shorter mutant fibrillin-1 molecules appeared to be exerting a powerful dominant-negative effect on the incorporation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fibrillin-1 molecules into microfibrils in this culture system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This severe inhibition of microfibril synthesis in cell culture contrasts with the 'classic' phenotype of the proband, suggesting that factors influencing microfibril formation may differ greatly between in vivo and in vitro environments </plain></SENT>
