<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aortic root was imaged using 2D echocardiography (parasternal long-axis view) and the SOV/Ann ratio calculated/analyzed in 27 Marfan patients and 45 age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> controls had a SOV/Ann ratio &lt;1.45, and 82% of Marfan's with ARD had a SOV/Ann ratio 1.45 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five of the Marfan patients with ARD had a SOV/Ann ratio &lt; 1.45 due to normalization of the SOV/Ann ratio because of pathologic annular enlargement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Determination of the SOV/Ann ratio allows rapid on-line screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> during 2D echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A SOV/Ann ratio 1.45 predicted ARD in young Marfan patients with a high degree of accuracy (sensitivity = 0.82, specificity = 1.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Screening for ARD using the SOV/Ann ratio fails when annular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> has progressed to the degree that the SOV/Ann ratio normalizes (SOV/Ann &lt; 1.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this subgroup of patients, determination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> will have to be evaluated by standard methods </plain></SENT>
