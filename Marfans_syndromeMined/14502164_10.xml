<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine how intrinsic mechanical properties of <z:mp ids='MP_0010470'>dilated ascending aorta</z:mp> influence in vivo distensibility and wall stress, potential contributing factors to the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003496" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic rupture</z:e> and dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fresh tissue from patients undergoing ascending aortic replacement for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (n = 8, age 38 +/- 14 years), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> with associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (n = 20, age 55 +/- 12 years), or idiopathic degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (n = 7, age 64 +/- 9 years) was analyzed for elastic properties and circumferential residual stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histologic specimens were graded for elastin fragmentation, cystic changes, <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Distensibility and wall stresses were predicted with a cylindrical mathematical model of the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Elastic properties of aortic tissue were nonlinear and extensibility decreased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moderate or severe elastin fragmentation was prevalent in tissue from patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and more common in tissue from younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Model-predicted mean circumferential stress did not vary significantly with age or patient group, but increased with aortic lumen diameter and systolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Model-predicted distensibility decreased with age in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> and degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Differences in distensibility were correlated with differences in elastic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The age dependence of elastic properties of <z:mp ids='MP_0010470'>dilated ascending aorta</z:mp> is consistent with that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aorta observed in previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increases in mean circumferential stress with blood pressure and diameter support the clinical importance of blood pressure control and serial evaluation of aortic diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Declining wall strength with age may increase the risk of rupture or dissection </plain></SENT>
