<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Since 1997 15 patients were operated on using this surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the patients, nine were male (60%) and six (40%) female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ages ranged from 23 to 75 years (mean 62.1+/-17.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The underlying disease was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta or root in 13 (86.6%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection in two (13.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients (26.6%) had skeletal manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional cardiac procedures were performed in two patients (13.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up time was 26.6+/-11.2 months (range 7-50 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative non-fatal complications occurred in two (13.3%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no valve-related late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurring 6 months after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival was 0.94+/-0.07 at 4 years; 4-year freedom from reoperation was 0.91+/-0.07 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The probability of needing reoperation was 8+/-0.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no instances of infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> or thromboembolic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At the end of the follow-up period, trivial or no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> was demonstrated in 57.1%, mild in 42.9% and no patient had an insufficiency graded &gt;/=moderate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography showed early postoperative reduction in left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions, which was maintained at follow-up controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Tirone David I procedure showed good early results, which encourage further use of this type of repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, further larger studies and long-term results are necessary for a definite judgment on this operative method </plain></SENT>
