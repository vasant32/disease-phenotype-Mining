<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Twenty three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and 69 healthy controls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subjects were screened for cariologic and periodontal alterations, as well as structural defects of enamel and dentin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data analysis was performed by using the t test, the chi-square test, and regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients aged 0 to 17 years were significantly at risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000670'>caries</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011351" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoplastic enamel</z:e> spots were more frequent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and could be related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000670'>caries</z:hpo> history of the deciduous dentition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Root deformity, abnormal pulp shape, and pulpal inclusions were a frequent finding in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Calculus and gingival indices were significantly higher in the study group as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the importance of early diagnosis of oral anomalies and timely treatment of dental problems in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A series of therapeutic guidelines to be integrated in treatment strategies is proposed </plain></SENT>
