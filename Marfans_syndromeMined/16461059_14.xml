<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aortic distensibility, stiffness index, and pulse-wave velocity were calculated using M-mode data in a TEE short-axis view in 31 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and 22 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Acceleration time, maximum wall expansion velocity (Vmax), and wall strain were determined from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> tracings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indexes derived from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> differed at a greater level of significance than M-mode-derived indexes in patients with dilated and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aortas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant predictors of <z:mp ids='MP_0010574'>aortic dilation</z:mp> were systolic blood pressure, aortic stiffness index, Vmax, and strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Decreased aortic strain and Vmax and increased stiffness index were predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (odds ratios 4.5, 3.3, and 2.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> assessment of aortic wall mechanics is complementary to standard M-mode measurements in discriminating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and is accurate in predicting <z:mp ids='MP_0010574'>aortic dilation</z:mp> and dissection </plain></SENT>
