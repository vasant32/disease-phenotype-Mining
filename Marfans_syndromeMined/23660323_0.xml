<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From October 2009 to September 2010, 10 patients of Fuwai Hospital received off-pump total thoracoabdominal aorta replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 5 were subjected to Standford B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, 2 were Standford A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> received total aortic arch replacement combined with transaortic stented graft implantation into the descending aorta.1 were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, and 2 were thoracoabdominal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> operations used the technique which preserved blood was transfused back by pump via the femoral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average surgery time was (7.4 ± 1.2) h and extubation time was (14.1 ± 2.5) h, the descending thoracic aorta crossclamp time was (11.5 ± 3.6) min, the intercostal artery reconstruction time was (16.4 ± 5.5) min, the required amount of blood products was fresh frozen plasma (600.5 ± 542.8) ml, platelet(1.7 ± 0.8) U, red blood cell (4.3 ± 2.4) U, autoblood salvage (465.7 ± 242.3) ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients occured <z:hpo ids='HP_0100750'>atelectasis</z:hpo> and one patient occurred seroperitoneum postoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the 10 patients were discharged from hospital without any neurologic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> management for total thoracoabdominal aortareplacement without cardiopulmonary bypass is feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It can reduce the side effects of deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> and had a good effect </plain></SENT>
