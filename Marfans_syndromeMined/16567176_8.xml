<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Anatomic and physiological parameters have not been routinely used in the preoperative and postoperative evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most symptomatic patients have had significant subjective improvement after pectus correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study is based upon the use of noninvasive upright echocardiography/electrocardiogram (echo/EKG) with exercise to both identify and provide evidence of correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> resulting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred twenty-three patients, 99 males and 24 females, ages 5 to 18 years (average, 13 years) underwent Nuss pectus repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A retrospective review of their medical records was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Symptoms related to exertion were present in 106 (86%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean Haller chest wall index (CWI) was 4.3 (2.4-10.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preoperative echo/EKG with exercise revealed cardiac compression in 117 (95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A mitral valve abnormality was present in 54 (44%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six children had no chamber compression but <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> was present in 2 and significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were asymptomatic after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Postoperative echo/EKG with exercise was performed in 107 (87%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The postoperative echo/EKG was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 100 (93% of those studied) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mild persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> existed in 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There were no postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Twelve (9.8%) patients with low CWI (&lt;3.25) were relieved of chamber compression and had no postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Patent ductus was discovered in 2 patients on their postoperative echos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>One closed spontaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>A child with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> required interventional occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Noninvasive echo/EKG with exercise is beneficial in the evaluation of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> and provides objective evidence of improvement postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>It is especially valuable as a physiological indicator of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormality</z:hpo> in patients with a CWI below 3.25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> need long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
