<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FBN1 is 237 kb in size and is located on chromosome 15q21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FBN1 mutations are known to cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and other fibrillinopathies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FBN1 is composed of 65 exons and 3 additional alternatively spliced exons at the 5' end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The absence of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> sequence from the extreme N-terminus of the fibrillin-1 protein and the presence of in-frame and alternatively spliced exons at the 5' end of the FBN1 gene create some ambiguity about the translation start site and indicate a functional role of these alternatively spliced exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate here the conservation of 5'-upstream region of the FBN1 gene among humans and non-human primates </plain></SENT>
