<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Between May 1980 and May 2000, 150 patients (123 males and 27 females) underwent surgery with the same surgeon for ascending aortic replacement with a valvular conduit and coronary reimplantation with the aid of a collar of aortic wall (button technique) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The average age was 50 +/- 16 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within this population, 114 patients had isolated annulo-ectasial disease, 36 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and 20 had dissection (5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and 15 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A carbon fibre valve with 2 leaflets was implanted in 124 patients, a mono-leaflet valve in 20 and 6 others required a heterograft due to their age or a contra-indication to anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The associated procedures were: 12 arch replacements, 5 myocardial revascularisations, 4 mitral replacements, 1 tricuspid plasty, 1 inter-atrial communication closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 30 patients (20%) there was a cardiovascular surgical re-intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The operative and first month mortality amounted to one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> on the 19th day, ie 0.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients were lost to follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average survival was 7.87 +/- 5.37 years (minimum 1, maximum 20 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival was 85% at 10 years and 60% at 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These figures are much higher than those reported in our previous statistics from 1994 when the percentage of survivors at 12 years was only 61% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the group of patients undergoing surgery before 60 years of age, the survival at 14 years was 94% and 81% at 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only four late re-interventions were attributable to the Bentall procedure, of which 2 were left coronary ostium stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and embolism was 0.42 per 100 patient-years and the rate of haemorrhagic accidents was identical, including minor accidents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This considerable improvement in long-term prognosis is explicable by the adoption of a single operative technique, considered to be the best, with the best myocardial protection thanks to coronary retro-perfusion and cold or hot cardioplegia, and also without doubt with the best medical survival </plain></SENT>
