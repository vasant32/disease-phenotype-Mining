<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-<z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eyes</z:mp> of 28 patients (16 males and 12 females, mean age 16.00 +/- 8.5) with simple (19 cases) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>-associated (9 cases) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> with different levels of subluxation underwent lens extraction with implantation of intraocular lenses (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e>) with scleral fixation (21 cases) or by lens extraction with implantation of the intraocular lenses in the capsular bag expanded by endocapsular ring (RING) (30 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Result analysis emphasized pre- and postoperative visual acuity during a six-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both techniques showed significant increase of postoperative visual acuity with and without correction, but it was better among the cases operated on by scleral fixation of the intraocular lenses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More than the used technique, the preoperative subluxation grades were crucial as to the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The two surgical techniques for correction of simple or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> are safe and effective, resulting in significant recovery of visual acuity, although surgical results are completely dependent on the preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001132'>lens subluxation</z:hpo> grades </plain></SENT>
