<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report describes the echocardiographic detection of progressive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the aortic root over an 18-month period, which led to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in a 33-year-old man with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>; however, at no time was the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> evident on chest x-ray films </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This patient illustrates the sensitivity of the echocardiogram in detecting and assessing the severity of disease of the aortic root not readily assessed by other noninvasive techniques and the value of serial measurements of aortic dimensions in patients with proven or suspected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the aortic root </plain></SENT>
