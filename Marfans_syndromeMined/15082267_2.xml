<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The incidence of late mortality and morbidity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> remained unchanged during the past 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was to analyze the risk factors of late events for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 5654 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (3871 males) were collected from the National Health Insurance Databases from 1996 to 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age, gender, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and initial treatment modality were the main factors to be investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Corrective group was defined by surgical operation with cardiopulmonary bypass and palliative group for the remaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Late aortic events were defined by late aneurysmal evolution of diseased aorta needing surgical intervention or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of aortic causes from 6 months to 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> was 43 per 1000000 population in our country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Corrective group accounted for 19.3% of them and palliative group for 80.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> accounted for 1.5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases (4.3% of corrective surgery group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of freedom from mortality at 1, 6 months, and 6 years was 80.4+/-1.3, 69.0+/-1.5, and 56.5+/-2.9% for corrective group and 89.5+/-0.5, 78.4+/-0.6, and 46.1+/-1.35% for palliative group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nearly half of the late mortalities were attributed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>-related conditions (cardiac, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or aortic causes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidence of late aortic events was 2.48% per year on an average, comparable between corrective and palliative groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This incidence increased since the fourth year after their initial episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For corrective group, young age was a risk factor of late aortic events (relative risk of 0.60-0.82 per decade, P = 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>For palliative group, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and male gender were risk factors of late aortic events (relative risk of 4.08-10.7, P &lt; 0.001 in the former; relative risk of 1.46-2.1, P = 0.002 in the latter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Late aortic events were not uncommon for both corrective and palliative groups, and its incidence increased since the fourth year after their initial episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Young age for corrective group, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and male gender for palliative group were risk factors of late aortic events </plain></SENT>
