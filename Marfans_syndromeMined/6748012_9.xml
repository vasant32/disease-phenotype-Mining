<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We suggest that these two sibs are examples of homozygosity for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> gene, based on the large number of affected members, the absence of additional consanguinity, manifestation of the syndrome in both parents, and the severity of the disease in the two sibs </plain></SENT>
