<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Repair of patients with extent I and II thoracoabdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> (TAAAs) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, whereas repair of more distal extent III and IV TAAAs has a lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we describe an approach using thoracic endovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> repair (TEVAR) as the index operation to convert extent I and II TAAAs to extent III and IV TAAAs amenable to subsequent open aortic repair to minimize patient risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between July 2007 and March 2012, 10 staged hybrid operations were performed to treat one extent I and nine extent II TAAAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>Aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> pathology included five <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type B dissections, three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type B dissections, and two penetrating aortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initially, the proximal descending thoracic aorta was repaired with TEVAR for coverage of the most proximal fenestration or penetrating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, with seven elective and three emergent repairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interval open distal aortic replacement was performed in a short-term planned setting or for progressive dilation of the distal aortic segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the open repair, the proximal end of the graft was sewn directly to the distal end of the TEVAR and outer wall of the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Average patient age was 48 years, and 60% were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Risk factors included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (80%), current tobacco use (50%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complications after TEVAR included type IA (n=1) and type II (n=3) endoleaks, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusions</z:hpo> (n=3), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute kidney injury</z:hpo> (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three patients required endovascular reinterventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients with dissection, persistent filling of the false lumen was common and associated with distal thoracic <z:mp ids='MP_0010574'>aortic dilation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Complications of open repair included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute kidney injury</z:hpo> in two patients, but no cardiac, pulmonary, or neurologic morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Median time between TEVAR and open repair was 14 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> or neurologic deficits occurred after either procedure during a median follow-up of 35 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A staged hybrid approach to extensive TAAAs combining proximal TEVAR, followed by interval open distal TAAA repair, is safe and appears to be an effective alternative to traditional open repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This approach may decrease the significant morbidity associated with single-stage open extent I and II TAAA repairs and may be applicable to multiple TAAA etiologies </plain></SENT>
