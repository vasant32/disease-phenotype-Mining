<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have studied <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>-causing mutations which affect calcium binding to cbEGF13, and demonstrate that in human fibroblast cells they cause unexpected endoplasmic reticulum retention, indicative of a folding defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biochemical and biophysical studies of in vitro refolded fragments from the TB3-cbEGF14 region indicate long-range and unidirectional effects of these substitutions on the adjacent N-terminal domain cbEGF12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only short-range effects of a pathogenic mutation affecting calcium binding to cbEGF19 are observed, and secretion of this mutant protein occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further NMR studies on <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> cbEGF12-13 and cbEGF12-14 identify a co-operative dependence of domain folding where calcium binding to cbEGF13 is required before cbEGF12 can adopt a native Ca(2+)-dependent fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that during biosynthesis of fibrillin-1, multiple tandem repeats of cbEGF domains may not necessarily fold independently and therefore missense mutations resulting in identical substitutions may have different effects on the fate of the mutant protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complex folding of modular proteins should therefore be considered when interpreting the molecular pathology of single-gene disorders </plain></SENT>
