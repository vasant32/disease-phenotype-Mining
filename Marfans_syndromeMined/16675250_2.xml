<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We study here the surgical results of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection involving the ascending aorta over the last 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with previous cardiac surgery, or proximal aortic repair, were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients survived an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection, undiagnosed as pauci- or asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aorta was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or pathological (atheromatous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in 15 cases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's disease</z:e> in 12 cases, and annuloectasic disease in 18 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 1981 and December 2001, 77 patients (mean age 48+/-15) underwent surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection of the ascending aorta; 60 patients had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, 12 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and 18 had annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only the ascending aorta was dissected in 37 patients, the ascending aorta and arch in 26, and the whole aorta in 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>Coronary artery disease</z:hpo> occurred in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed using SAS software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Different surgical procedures were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The aortic arch was repaired in 40 cases; selective antegrade cerebral perfusion and partial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Total aortic replacement was performed on four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In-hospital mortality was 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The only risk factor was the extent of the dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The rate of neurologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 2.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Late survival rate was 42+/-7.5% at 12 years for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients; it was 71+/-10% when only the ascending aorta was dissected, 44+/-11% when the ascending aorta and arch were dissected, and 33+/-15% when the whole aorta was dissected (p = 0.0329) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The extent of the dissection was the only risk factor for late mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Reoperation was required for one proximal and five distal problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, in-hospital and late mortality were related to the extent of the dissection; in-hospital mortality remained unchanged during the operative period </plain></SENT>
