<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>During the period 1968-1985, aortic valve replacement was performed in 871 patients, 617 males and 254 females aged 49.6 years in mean (15 to 75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Up to the end of 1988, 42 patients (4.8%) were reoperated on because of periprosthetic leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In primary surgery, annular calcification was found in 27 of these patients (64%), 17 patients (40%) had a bicuspid valve, and a positive culture from the excised valve was diagnosed in one of three patients with active native <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and two others postendocardial regurgitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At primary surgery, mechanical prostheses were inserted in every case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences between the prosthetic models used could not be shown as regards to the occurrence of periprosthetic leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To implant the valve, interrupted everted U-mattress sutures with pledgets appeared to be the best method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Leakage occurred in 21 patients (50%) during their hospital stay and in 18 patients (43%) during the follow-up period of four months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three others developed leakage two to four years from primary surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The main indication for reoperation was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> alone or combined with heamolytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> in 37 (88%) of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients required the reoperation due to infectious dehiscence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively, 34 patients (81%) were in NYHA (The New York Heart Association) Class III-IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A new prosthetic valve was implanted in 23 cases, a composite graft once and in 18 cases refixation was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two patients died in association with surgery, both due to the low output syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up time of 6.4 years, eight patients developed recurrent leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Four of them were found during their hospital stay and four others later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The role of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0349726" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prosthetic infection</z:e> was remarkable in these eight cases; three patients with preoperative infectious dehiscence of the prosthesis had recurrence and one patient developed prosthetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> with leakage later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Three patients required more reoperations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>At follow-up study, leakage was diagnosed in five of 28 living patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Three of them were not significant and two moderate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>24 patients (86%) were in NYHA Class I-II </plain></SENT>
