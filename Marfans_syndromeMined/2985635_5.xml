<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> condition producing a generalized abnormality in connective tissue, no consistent abnormality has been identified, although one individual has been found to have an elongated pro alpha 2(I) collagen chain [Byers et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 78:7745, 1981] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the nature of the alteration in the gene that produced this abnormality, we studied the pro alpha 2(I) gene from this individual by genomic blotting and gene cloning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genomic mapping studies detected no abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, analysis of the cloned segment of the pro alpha 2(I) collagen gene from the Marfan individual indicates that the gene contains a 38 base pair insertion in an intron near the collagenase cleavage site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the relationship of this insertion to the protein abnormality is unclear, it may be a useful marker for the diagnosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
