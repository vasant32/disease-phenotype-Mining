<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current molecular genetic testing of FBN1 may miss mutations in the promoter region or in other noncoding sequences as well as partial or complete gene deletions and duplications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested for copy number variations by successively applying multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and the Affymetrix Human Mapping 500 K Array Set, which contains probes for approximately 500,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By analyzing genomic DNA of 101 unrelated individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> or related phenotypes in whom standard genetic testing detected no mutation, we identified FBN1 deletions in two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our high-resolution approach narrowed down the deletion breakpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequent sequencing of the junctional fragments revealed the deletion sizes of 26,887 and 302,580 bp, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, both deletions affect the putative regulatory and promoter region of the FBN1 gene, strongly indicating that they abolish transcription of the deleted allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This expectation of complete loss of function of one allele, i.e. true haploinsufficiency, was confirmed by transcript analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings not only emphasize the importance of screening for large genomic rearrangements in comprehensive genetic testing of FBN1 but, importantly, also extend the molecular etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> by providing hitherto unreported evidence that true haploinsufficiency is sufficient to cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
