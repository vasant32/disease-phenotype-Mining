<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a 46-year-old female patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who presented with excruciating retrosternal pain and breathing distress after a bowel movement with stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging and multicolour sonography showed type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> extending from the aortic root to the right iliac artery, with intimal tears in the ascending aorta above the sinotubular junction, the distal arch beyond the left subclavian artery and the isthmic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We adapted the endoluminal stenting technique to this case of type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> by sealing the intimal tears in the ascending aorta using endovascular introduction of one endoluminal graft, as confirmed on angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient was discharged after 10 days </plain></SENT>
