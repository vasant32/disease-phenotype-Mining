<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Ninety-four patients (37 male, 57 female; mean age, 51.0 years) underwent reconstruction for renal artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (RAA) between 1980 and 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RAAs were present in 52 patients in the right kidney, in 29 patients in the left kidney, and in 13 patients in both kidneys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty-three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were located in the mainstem, 49 in a branch artery, and four in an accessory artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional ipsilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035067" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal artery stenoses</z:e> (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) occurred in 26 patients, bilateral <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> in 18, and contralateral <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> in six </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The causes of RAA were fibromuscular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (n = 48), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (n = 28), dissection (n = 7), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001680'>aortic coarctation</z:hpo> (n = 5), <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> (n = 3), giant cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> (n = 1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (n = 1), and trauma (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy-five patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, 14 were asymptomatic, and five had rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indications for RAA repair concerned <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with 1 cm or more diameter in combination with risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, ipsilateral and contralateral stenosis, and childbearing age in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Without risk factors, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> size eligible for reconstruction was limited to 2 cm or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Methods applied for reconstruction in 107 kidneys and 136 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> resection with tailoring (n = 37), saphenous vein graft interposition (n = 40), tailoring and saphenous vein graft interposition (n = 7), resection and reanastomosis (n = 14), saphenous vein graft interposition and resection and reanastomosis (n = 3), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> bypass (n = 5), and homologous vein graft interposition (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four reconstructions had to be performed ex situ because of multiple branch involvement in three patients and rupture in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, the concerned kidney was protected with hypothermic flush perfusion with addition of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15544">prostaglandin E1</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall morbidity rate was 17%, including one early graft occlusion, one partial <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the renal artery that necessitated fibrinolytic therapy, and a branch <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> after tailoring managed with aortorenal bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mortality in elective cases was null; one patient died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> 2 days after an emergency operation for ruptured RAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The technical primary success rate was 96.8%; the secondary success rate was 98.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>After a follow-up period from 1 to 143 months (mean, 46 months) in 83 patients (88%), 67 (81%) had patent renal arteries free of stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Among six patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, four underwent successful reoperation, five had mainstem occlusions, three had segmental <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp>, and two underwent nephrectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Concerning the patients who underwent reoperation, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was considered seriously but assessed as inappropriate because of long extension of stenosis or involvement of branch arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was cured in 19 patients (25%) and improved in 17 (22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Surgical reconstruction of RAA is a safe procedure that provides good long-term results, prevents <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture, cures or improves <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in about half of the cases, and can be achieved with autogenous reconstruction in 96% </plain></SENT>
