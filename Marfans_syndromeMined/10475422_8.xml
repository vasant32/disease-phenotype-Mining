<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The results of 100 consecutive pediatric AVRs (50 mechanical, 50 human) were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were five perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the mechanical group and one in the human group (p = 0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Late complications in the mechanical group included 4 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, 2 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, 3 thromboembolic complications, and 10 reoperations on the aortic valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the human group, there were no late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, 2 reoperations for allograft aortic valve deterioration (both in Marfan's patients), and 1 reoperation for allograft <z:hpo ids='HP_0001642'>pulmonary valve stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four-year actuarial survival was 83% in the mechanical group and 98% in the human group (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four-year actuarial survival free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> valve-related complications was 61% in the mechanical group and 88% in the human group (p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Human valves in children requiring AVR provide superior intermediate-term survival and freedom from valve-related complications compared to mechanical valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> may represent a rare remaining contraindication for human AVR in children </plain></SENT>
