<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 17 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Operative indications were increasing subluxation of the lens, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachments</z:hpo> and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The operative procedure depended on patient age and findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients were operated in both eyes and six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients in <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Stabilization or functional improvement of visual acuity could be achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in whom no disorders limiting visual acuity or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000646'>amblyopia</z:hpo> were present preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In six eyes of five patients, lens insertion was accomplished via a pars plana approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lens removal without implantation of an intraocular lens was performed in 16 eyes of 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pars plana vitrectomy was accomplished in 12 eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complications were well controlled by pars plana vitrectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Difficult preoperative situations and postoperative complications are not rare in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, they can be controlled well by means of modern vitreous surgery </plain></SENT>
