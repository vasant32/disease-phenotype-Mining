<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to evaluate relational and sexual behaviors, satisfaction, and functioning in a representative sample of patients with CHD and their partners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we aimed to evaluate the relation between sexuality parameters and quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relational and sexuality issues were assessed using a sexuality questionnaire in 133 patients (52% men, 37 Â± 13 years old) with CHD (43 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001680'>coarctation of the aorta</z:hpo>, 42 with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>transposition of great arteries</z:mp>, 36 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and 12 with Eisenmenger syndrome), and 74 partners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quality of life was assessed using the Dutch translation of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were compared to an age- and gender-matched control group (n = 3,642) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventy-one percent of patients with CHD were involved in a relationship, which was significantly less compared to controls (79%, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, patients perceived their relationship as more satisfactory compared to controls (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, sexual satisfaction was equal in patients compared to controls, although they perceived lower body esteem (p &lt; 0.001), decreased sexual esteem (p &lt; 0.05), and more distress during sex (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients reported no more erectile and lubrication problems compared to partners and to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found significant associations between most relational and sexual parameters and quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, many aspects of sexuality are affected in adult patients with CHD, whereas their partners remain relatively unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, sexuality is an important aspect of quality of life in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We advise physicians to be receptive to discuss sexuality issues and provide patients with adequate therapy </plain></SENT>
