<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Advances in the treatment of the syndrome have improved prognosis, but the long-term reoperation rate is still high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It remains unknown which factors influence the long-term prognosis, including the reoperation and mortality rates, in surgically treated Chinese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors studied 125 such patients to investigate factors influencing prognosis after aortic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A retrospective clinical investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: An academic medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: One hundred twenty-five Marfan patients who had undergone aortic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: None </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The indications for aortic surgery were <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> and/or dissection in the 125 Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most commonly performed procedure was the Bentall in 92 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients underwent total arch replacement combined with stented elephant trunk implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ten patients underwent the David procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall in-hospital and 30-day mortality rate was 1.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The survival rate was 97.5%, 91.4%, and 74.2% at 1, 5, and 10 years after surgery, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The reoperation rate was 2.5%, 12.9%, and 32.9% at 1, 5, and 10 years after surgery, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that increased systolic blood pressure (Sys BP) was the predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05), and body mass index and smoking were significant predictors of reoperation (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present findings report the factors influencing the prognosis of Chinese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> after aortic surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Managing these risk factors may enable health care professionals to improve the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients after aortic surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
