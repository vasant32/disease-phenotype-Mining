<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As diagnostic tools have improved our ability to identify aortic pathology, surgical outcomes have also improved, making intervention a life-saving option in the majority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we aim to examine the indications for surgical intervention on the dilated aorta, particularly the ascending segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studies of the natural history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> exceeding 6 cm in maximum diameter are associated with a particularly high risk of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the interest of providing some margin of safety, most surgeons would agree that intervention is indicated with an aortic diameter of 5.5 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many would intervene even earlier (at 5.0 cm) for patients at low surgical risk, or for those with known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In some cases, only the ascending aortic segment needs to be treated, while in others full root replacement is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reduction aortoplasty has been superseded largely by interposition graft replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The standard procedure involves replacement of the valve and root with a composite mechanical conduit or tissue root prosthesis, and results are excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recently developed valve-sparing root reconstructive options, however, are promising and have encouraged an even more aggressive surgical stance </plain></SENT>
