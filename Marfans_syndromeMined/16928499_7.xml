<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the midterm clinical results of valve-preserving aortic root reconstruction by means of a modified conduit incorporating sinuses of Valsalva </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During a 5-year period, 151 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the aortic root underwent a reimplantation type of valve-sparing procedure using the Gelweave Valsalva prosthesis that incorporates sinuses of Valsalva </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 121 males (80.1%), and the mean age was 56.4 +/- 14.4 years (range, 14 to 83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen percent of the patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and 8.6% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (4.6%) suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aortic replacement was extended to the arch in 14 patients (9.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (10.6%) had associated cusp repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In-hospital mortality was 3.3%, and it was significantly higher among patients operated on for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection (p = 0.001) and in symptomatic patients (III-IV New York Heart Association class; p = 0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up (mean, 18 months; range, 1 to 60) was 100% complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 2 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (6.8%) had 3 to 4+ <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, and 8 of these required late aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cusp repair was associated with a high incidence of late aortic valve replacement (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At 5 years, freedom from aortic valve replacement and freedom from grade 3 to 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> was 90.8% +/- 3.3% and 88.7% +/- 3.6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The reimplantation valve-sparing procedure with the Gelweave Valsalva prosthesis provides satisfactory results for patients with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Aortic cusp repair may lead to late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Proper leaflet evaluation is of paramount importance in preventing residual valve regurgitation </plain></SENT>
