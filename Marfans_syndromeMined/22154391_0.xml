<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging has demonstrated that the aortic root may be dilated in a dimension that two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) is not able to interrogate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the standard parasternal long-axis view, only a portion of the aortic root in the anteroposterior (AP) dimension can be visualized, as opposed to three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography (3DE), which can capture the entire root in an infinite number of planes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purposes of the present study were to compare measurements of <z:mp ids='MP_0011575'>dilated aortic roots</z:mp> between 3DE and 2DE and to evaluate interobserver variability on 3DE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-one patients (median age, 13 years) with aortic root dilation were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional echocardiographic images and full-volume electrocardiographically gated 3D echocardiographic (3DE) images were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two blinded observers measured six dimensions of the aortic root in the short-axis view: three in the AP dimension and three in the transverse dimensions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional echocardiographic measurements were made by a third blinded observer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The largest AP 3DE measurement was compared with two-dimensional echocardiographic measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interobserver 3DE measurements were also compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median aortic root Z score was +2.63 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Maximum 3DE measurement in any plane of the root size was significantly greater than on 2DE (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The largest AP dimension by 3DE was significantly greater than on 2DE (P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no significant interobserver variability for the largest dimension or those in the AP dimension, but a difference was found in the transverse dimension (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional echocardiography compares favorably with 2DE in the evaluation of aortic root dilation in patients with known histories of aortic root disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional echocardiography found that the largest diameter measured was significantly larger than on 2DE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The interobserver variability of 3DE is low, particularly in the AP dimension and in identifying the largest diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional echocardiography can be a useful technique in the periodic surveillance of patients with aortic root dilation </plain></SENT>
