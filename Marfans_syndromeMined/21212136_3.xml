<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence and phenotype of smooth muscle alpha-actin (ACTA2) mutations in non-syndromic thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and dissections (TAAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Observational study of ACTA2 mutations in TAAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Centre for Inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">Cardiovascular Diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A consecutive series of 100 patients with TAAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria included genetically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, Loeys-Dietz type 2, familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos</z:e> type IV syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Multidisciplinary clinical and imaging evaluation, genetic counselling and testing of ACTA2, and family screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of ACTA2 mutations and corresponding phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TAAD was familial in 43 cases and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> in 57 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five mutations in the familial TAAD group (12%) were identified that were absent in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The known p.Arg149Cys and the novel p.Asp82Glu, p.Glu243Lys and p.Val45Leu mutations affected evolutionarily conserved residues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The IVS4+1G&gt;A mutation was novel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of 14 affected relatives, 13 were carriers of the mutation identified in the corresponding proband while one deceased relative had no genetic test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Type A dissection was the first manifestation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> in four probands and occurred unexpectedly in five relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> was age dependent and absent in mutated children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Of nine patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection, five died following surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>At dissection, the size of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> ranged from 40 mm to 95 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Extravascular, ocular, skeletal, <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> and pulmonary traits were variably associated with TAAD, with iris flocculi being most common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Timely diagnosis of TAAD in the probands, genetic counselling and family screening identify predisposed relatives and prevent catastrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
