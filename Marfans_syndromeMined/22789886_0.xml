<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The study sought to assess the impact of pregnancy on the rate of aortic growth as well as on short- and long-term clinical outcomes in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data on peripartum and long-term clinical outcomes in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who are followed prospectively during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Echocardiographic, demographic, and surgical data review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> adult females with a confirmed diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 98 women identified, 69 (72%) experienced a total of 199 pregnancies resulting in 170 (86%) live births </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median number of pregnancies per women was 3 (interquartile range: 1 to 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Obstetrical complications occurred in 17 (10%) and adverse fetal outcomes in 22 (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No woman experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> or required cardiac surgery during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aortic growth rate increased during pregnancy and did not return to baseline following pregnancy completion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite the lack of catastrophic peripartum complications, the prevalence of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and elective aortic surgery during long-term follow-up was higher in those women who had a prior pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for adverse cardiac outcome included greater aortic diameter, greater rate of aortic growth during pregnancy, increased number of pregnancies, lack of beta-blocker use during pregnancy, and lack of prospective pregnancy follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a low incidence of aortic complications during pregnancy in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and an aortic diameter &lt;4.5 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, pregnancy does increase the risk of aortic complications in the long-term in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
