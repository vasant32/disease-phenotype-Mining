<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: This study investigates the relative influence of the regional availability of health care resources (measured by physician densities, number of health care centers) on health care quality (measured by delay in diagnosis), based on data for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disease</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan Syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Administrative data from 389 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan Syndrome</z:e> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression models were applied for a dichotomous comparison of the dependent variable 'time to diagnosis' with the classifications 'immediate' and 'late' diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physician densities of cardiologists/angiologists, ophthalmologists, orthopedists, and GPs, as well as distance to medical health care centers and sociodemographic information were entered into the models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results showed that the relationship between physician densities and probability of immediate diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan Syndrome</z:e> is negative linear, and quadratic for cardiologists/angiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This effect was significant with respect to density of cardiologists/angiologists (p=0.0097) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Distance to medical health care centers was not a predictor of an immediate diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan Syndrome</z:e> faces significant problems of quality of health care, as although the requisite quantity of health care resources is available, this does not affect delay in diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Information technology might foster valuable networking among physicians treating such cases along with holistic assessment of symptoms as they occur </plain></SENT>
