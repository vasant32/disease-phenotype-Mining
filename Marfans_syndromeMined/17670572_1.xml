<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the absence of the sinuses of Valsalva might limit valve durability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Gelweave Valsalva prosthesis, which presents pre-fashioned neo-sinuses, has been designed in order to avoid early leaflets deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report our results in 63 patients who underwent valve-sparing operations (reimplantation technique) using the Gelweave Valsalva graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main indication was ascending aorta <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> or annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath>, with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The operation was performed also in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>Bicuspid Aortic Valve</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp>), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> Type A dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In-hospital mortality was of 4.7%, and two thirds were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> Type A dissection patients (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three years freedom from grade 3-4 AI and freedom from late aortic valve replacement were 91.7+/-4.3% and 93.8+/-5.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aortic valve-sparing operations show good results in patients electively operated for aortic root <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Aortic cusps repair may lead to late failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Even if the Gelweave Valsalva prosthesis is easy to implant and it also reproduces pseudosinuses, a long-term follow up is necessary to determine if this graft may reduce leaflets deterioration </plain></SENT>
