<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data on smoking history and cardiovascular mortality were extracted from the Euro Heart Survey on adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> - a retrospective cohort study, that included patients diagnosed with 1 of 8 subgroups of ACHD (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>Atrial Septal Defects</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>Ventricular Septal Defects</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan Syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001680'>Aortic Coarctation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>Tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> (ToF), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001669'>Transposition of the Great Arteries</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>), Fontan circulation, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001575'>Cyanotic</z:mp> disease) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete data of 3375 ACHD patients (median age 28 years) were available for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At inclusion, 9.3% (n=314) were current smokers and 4.2% (n=142) of the patients had smoked in the past </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 5.1 years, 101 patients (3%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the majority of cases the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was cardiovascular (n=81; 80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier and Cox survival analysis for each of the defects separately showed a significantly increased age and sex-adjusted cardiovascular mortality associated with smoking exposure in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients (Hazard ratio 4.2 (95% CI 1.0-16.8); P=0.044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also in ToF mortality was higher amongst smokers, though not significantly (HR 3.4 (95% CI 0.6-18.5); P=0.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the remaining defects no relationship between smoking and cardiovascular mortality was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of smoking amongst ACHD patients is relatively low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Smoking exposure is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prospective long-term follow-up studies are necessary </plain></SENT>
