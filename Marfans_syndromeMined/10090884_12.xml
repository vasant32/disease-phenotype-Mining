<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the FBN1 gene cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>), a dominantly inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the identified FBN1mutations have been family specific, and the rate of new mutations is high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here a de novo FBN1mutation that was identified in two sisters with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> born to clinically unaffected parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The paternity and maternity were unequivocally confirmed by genotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although one of the parents had to be an obligatory carrier for the mutation, we could not detect the mutation in the leukocyte DNA of either parent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To identify which parent was a mosaic for the mutation we analyzed several tissues from both parents, with a quantitative and sensitive solid-phase minisequencing method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mutation was not, however, detectable in any of the analyzed tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the mutation could not be identified in a sperm sample from the father or in samples of multiple tissue from the mother, we concluded that the mother was the likely mosaic parent and that the mutation must have occurred during the early development of her germ-line cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mosaicism confined to germ-line cells has rarely been reported, and this report of mosaicism for the FBN1 mutation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> represents an important case, in light of the evaluation of the recurrence risk in genetic counseling of families with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
