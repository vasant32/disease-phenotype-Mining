<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Purpose:  To study the ocular characteristics in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods:  One hundred and two eyes of 51 participants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> were included in this descriptive study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ocular characteristics, visual acuity (VA) and biometric values were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results:  The mean patient age was 39.0 years (range, 12.7-71.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-seven eyes were phakic, five aphakic and 20 pseudophakic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-<z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eyes</z:mp> had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> (EL), 12 eyes <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo>, nine eyes <z:hpo ids='HP_0000486'>strabismus</z:hpo>, five eyes <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> and four eyes had undergone surgery for a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> (RD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ninety-four eyes (92%) had a best spectacle-corrected VA of 0.3 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) or better </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 77 phakic eyes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo> exceeding -3 D was seen in 12/31 eyes (39%) with EL, and in 12/46 eyes (26%) without EL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean axial length (AL) was 24.73 mm (range, 21.59-32.75); 39 eyes (51%) had abnormally increased AL (≥24.5 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean K(med) (mean value of K(min) and K(max) ) was 42.2 D (38.7-46.9 D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found in refraction, AL or corneal curvature between eyes with and without EL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lens-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000483'>astigmatism</z:hpo> was seen in 15 (48%) eyes with EL versus four (12%) eyes without EL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seventeen of the pseudophakic eyes underwent surgery for EL, with history of postoperative RD in <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conclusion:  Despite increased AL, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011003'>high myopia</z:hpo> is not as common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> as expected because of a flat cornea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Biometry should be considered in suspected cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> when EL is not present </plain></SENT>
