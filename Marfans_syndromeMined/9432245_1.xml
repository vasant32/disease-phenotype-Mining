<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The ideal and safe surgical method for Marfan-associated or idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001132'>lens subluxations</z:hpo> is still a matter of debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1990 and 1995, 23 eyes were operated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001132'>lens subluxations</z:hpo>, mainly because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>decreased visual acuity</z:hpo>, but also because of conservatively uncontrolled secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Marfan patients were 27.0 (5-62) years old at surgery; patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001132'>lens subluxations</z:hpo> were 38.5 (11-63) years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgical procedure depended on patient age and anatomical conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients achieved an increase in visual acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000646'>Amblyopia</z:hpo> existed in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> problems due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> were controlled postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our greatest concern was rhegmatogenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It occurred in only <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> of a non-Marfan patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prognosis for lens surgery in Martan-associated and idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001132'>lens subluxations</z:hpo> is good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The implantation of a posterior chamber lens provides a good and secure means of optical rehabilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our preferred primary transscleral suture technique guarantees high security and stability of position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Previously feared surgical risks have been reduced by modern surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
