<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Prospective radiographic and clinical analysis of a consecutive unselected population of persons with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan Syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine <z:hpo ids='HP_0003319'>cervical spine abnormalities</z:hpo> present in the Marfan population compared with that seen in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In the treatment of a large population of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan Syndrome</z:e>, three serious cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037933" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spine disorders</z:e> were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To the authors' knowledge, no report of cervical abnormalities in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan Syndrome</z:e> exists in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the cervical spine in these patients was studied in a systematic fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An unselected group of 104 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan Syndrome</z:e> seen at a medical genetics follow-up examination underwent lateral neutral and flexion-extension cervical spine radiographs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Parameters of alignment, size, and stability were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan Syndrome</z:e> aged 35-45 years and matched controls were given a pain questionnaire to complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> was 16% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A large number of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan Syndrome</z:e> (54%) had increased atlantoaxial translation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The preadolescent Marfan population has a greater range of motion than either the adolescent or adult populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The Marfan population has an increased radiographic prevalence of basilar impression (36%), and the odontoid height (3.69 +/- 0.53 cm) was larger than reported norms (2.34 +/- 0.22 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cervical stenosis was rare, with 3% having a critical Torg ratio at C3 and 2% having a critical Torg ratio at C6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Neck pain frequency did not differ significantly from that of age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Based on the increased prevalence of several cervical bony and ligamentous abnormalities, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan Syndrome</z:e> were recommended to avoid sports with risks of high-impact loading of the cervical spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Given the rarity of actual neurologic injuries in the Marfan population, however, radiographs for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan Syndrome</z:e> undergoing general anesthesia is not recommended </plain></SENT>
