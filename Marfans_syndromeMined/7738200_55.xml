<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Dermal fibroblasts from a 13-yr-old boy with isolated skeletal features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> were used to study fibrillin synthesis and processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only one half of the secreted profibrillin was proteolytically processed to fibrillin outside the cell and deposited into the extracellular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopic examination of rotary shadowed microfibrils made by the proband's fibroblasts were indistinguishable from control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of the FBN1 gene revealed a heterozygous C to T transition at nucleotide 8176 resulting in the substitution of a tryptophan for an arginine (R2726W), at a site immediately adjacent to a consensus sequence recognized by a cellular protease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six other individuals in the proband's family had the FBN1 mutation that segregated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000098'>tall stature</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the affected individuals have cardiac or ocular manifestations of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This mutation identifies a putative site for profibrillin to fibrillin processing, and is associated with isolated skeletal features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, indicating that the FBN1 gene is one of the genes that determines height in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cellular effect of the mutation may be equivalent to a "null" FBN1 allele and may define the phenotype associated with FBN1 "null" alleles </plain></SENT>
