<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>Intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> are acquired lesions (5-10% of the population), a fraction of which rupture leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> with devastating consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Until now, the exact etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> formation remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The low incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in comparison with the prevalence of unruptured IAs suggests that the vast majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> do not rupture and that identifying those at highest risk is important in defining the optimal management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most important factors predicting rupture are <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> size and site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to ambiental factors (smoking, excessive alcohol consumption and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>), epidemiological studies have demonstrated a familiar influence contributing to the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>, with increased frequency in first- and second-degree relatives of people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In comparison to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> tend to be larger, more often located at the middle cerebral artery, and more likely to be multiple </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other than familiar occurrence, there are several heritable conditions associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> formation, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000113'>polycystic kidney disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> type I, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0100568'>endocrine neoplasia</z:hpo> type I, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033847" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PXE">pseudoxanthoma elasticum</z:e>, hereditary hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="EDS2">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type II</z:e> and IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The familial occurrence and the association with heritable conditions indicate that genetic factors may play a role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide linkage studies in families and sib pairs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> have identified several loci on chromosomes showing suggestive evidence of linkage, particularly on chromosomes 1p34.3-p36.13, 7q11, 19q13.3, and Xp22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For the loci on 1p34.3-p36.13 and 7q11, a moderate positive association with positional candidate genes has been demonstrated (perlecan gene, elastin gene, collagen type 1 A2 gene) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 3 of the polymorphisms analyzed in 2 genes (endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase T786C, interleukin-6 G572C, and interleukin-6 G174C) were found to be significantly associated with ruptured/unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>: the endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase gene single-nucleotide polymorphisms increased the risk, while IL-6 G174C seemed protective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>More recently, two genomic loci (endothelin receptor A and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2BAS) have been found to be significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> in the Japanese population; endothelin-1 is a potent vasoconstrictor produced by the endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Until now, there are no diagnostic tests for specific genetic risk factors to identify patients who are at a high risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of the genetic determinants may be useful in order to allow clues on stopping <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation and obtain diagnostic tools for identifying individuals at increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further multicenter studies have to be carried out </plain></SENT>
