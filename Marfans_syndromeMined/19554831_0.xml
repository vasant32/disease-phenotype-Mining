<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The defect in the connective tissue protein can lead to several organ dysfunctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the life expectancy, the cardiovascular aspect is of paramount importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> may develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and valvular heart defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> consists in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> or rupture with their fatal consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Besides the cardiovascular manifestation, the skeletal and ocular system can also be affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The skeletal manifestation is often characterised by <z:mp ids='MP_0000548'>long limbs</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo>, and abnormal joint flexibility along with other signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients may also have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>dislocated lenses</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> of the dural sac, stretch marks, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002108'>spontaneous pneumothorax</z:hpo>, recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo>, or a family history suspicious for Marfan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the past years, other related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> with analogous organ manifestation have been described (e.g., Loeys-Dietz syndrome) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this article we present the basic knowledge about these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e>, and we mention new insights in the recently explored pathophysiology of the disorder which is a possible target for future medical treatment options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, recent new concepts for the prophylactic treatment of the aortic manifestation are explained </plain></SENT>
