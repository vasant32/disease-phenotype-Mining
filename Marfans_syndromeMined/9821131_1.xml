<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the single-leg-stance footprint of 124 feet in 63 patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> by using pressure-sensitive film and a Harris mat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty feet in 21 people with no history of foot problems were evaluated as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The medial and lateral aspects of the fore-, mid-, and hindfoot were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The midfoot was further analyzed by dividing the medial midfoot force by the total midfoot force </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean medial midfoot force/total midfoot force (MM/TM) in the control population was 11.1% (SD, 6.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001763'>Pes planus</z:hpo> was defined as the MM/TM force &gt; 24.0% (mean + 2 SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean MM/TM force in the Marfan group was not statistically different (16.0%) from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The distribution, however, revealed two distinct types of weight-bearing patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the Marfan group, 74.8% had medial forces within the standard distribution of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only 25.2% of the Marfan patients had forces that were outside the range of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> midfoot forces and were defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001763'>pes planus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001380'>ligamentous laxity</z:hpo> and the foot function in the Marfan population revealed no statistically significant correlation to the type of weight-bearing pattern of the foot </plain></SENT>
