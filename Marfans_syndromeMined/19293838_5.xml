<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of each single feature in the Ghent criteria in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate this, a cross-sectional study of 105 adults with presumed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were examined by the same group of investigators with standardized and complete assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> features in the Ghent criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighty-seven (83%) fulfilled the criteria in 56 different variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most prevalent major criterion in Ghent-positive persons was <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> (91%), followed by major genetic criterion (89%) and ectopic lenses (62 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 14 persons (16%), the diagnosis was dependent on the dural findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 79% fulfilled both major dural and major genetic (positive family history and/or FBN1 mutation) criteria, suggesting that most patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> might be identified by investigating these criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A history or finding of ascending <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> was present in 46 patients (53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This low prevalence might partly reflect a high number of diagnosed patients encompassing the whole spectrum of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The study confirms the need to examine for the complete set of features in the Ghent criteria to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The majority of persons with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> might be identified by the combined assessment of dura mater and family history, supplemented with DNA analysis in family-negative cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The low prevalence of ascending <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> might indicate better future prospects in an adult population than those traditionally considered </plain></SENT>
