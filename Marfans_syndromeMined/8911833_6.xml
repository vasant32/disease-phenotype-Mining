<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of ischemic cord injury, we have retrospectively studied the 115 patients who underwent a replacement of the thoracic descending or thoraco-abdominal aorta between January 1980 and December 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 72 patients the aortic lesion was located above the diaphragm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aortic replacement was performed with the aid of extracorporeal circulation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 2 patients (97.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only two cases of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> were observed (2.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 43 patients (10 females and 33 males aged from 26 to 69 years), the occurrence of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> was considered as a major risk, because of the extension of the aortic lesions (Crawford types I, II and III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients (60.4%) suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection and 17 patients had atheromatous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (37.2%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients (27.9%) had already undergone aortic replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A preoperative study of the spinal cord vascularization was carried out in 36 patients (83.6%) and the Adamkiewicz artery was visualized in 28 patients (77.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 17 patients (39.5%, group I), the surgical procedure was performed without the aid of extracorporeal circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 26 patients (60.5%, group II), the surgical procedure was carried out with the aid of cardiopulmonary bypass and profound hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sequential unclamping of the aorta was used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The cord vascularization was surgically restored in 32 patients (74.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>When the Adamkiewicz artery was identified, the critical intercostal artery was reimplanted together with the two pairs of adjacent intercostal arteries (25 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>When the origin of the Adamkiewicz artery remained unknown, the two or three most important patent pairs of intercostal arteries were reimplanted (7 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In 8 patients (18.6%) there were no patent intercostal arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hospital mortality accounted for 37.2% (16 patients, including 5 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, extension of the aortic lesions, emergency and redo surgery were the only significant risk factors of mortality (P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Cord <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was observed in 9 patients (21%): permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> in 7 patients (16.2%) and transient medullar disturbance in 2 patients (4.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> was reduced, though not significantly, in group II (16%) vs group I (29%) and in patients with preoperative assessment of the cord vascularization (18% vs 38%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our experience: 1) The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> is related to the extension and the type of the aortic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>2) The preoperative study of the medullar vascularization and the use of extracorporeal circulation with deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> and sequential aortic unclamping, reduce the risk of severe cord <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and 3) Occurrence of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> depends on several factors and cannot be totally prevented by the surgical technique </plain></SENT>
