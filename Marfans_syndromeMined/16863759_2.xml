<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The goal of total aortic resection surgery is to correct the extensive or multiple sites of aortic pathology, which involves the entire length of the vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study describes our experience in this operation at Fuwai Cardiovascular Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From February 2004 to October 2005, thirteen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> underwent one-stage total or subtotal aortic replacement for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four patients received subtotal aortic replacement (ascending aorta to the abdominal aorta) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine patients underwent total aortic replacement (ascending aorta to the aortic bifurcation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Operations were performed under <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> with profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were opened with a mid-sternotomy and a thoracoabdominal incision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Extracorporeal circulation was instituted with two arterial cannulae and a single venous cannula in the right atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During cooling, the ascending aorta or aortic root was replaced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the nasopharyngeal temperature of 20 degrees C, the aortic arch was replaced with selective antegrade cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After brain reperfusion, staged aortic occlusions allowed for replacement of descending thoracic and abdominal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Intercostal, visceral, and renal arteries were anastomosed to the graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no operative or early postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One case of postoperative complication was noted for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> secondary to embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Spinal neurologic deficits did not occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>At the last follow-up, ranging from 4 to 24 months postoperatively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 13 patients were alive and had good functional status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: One-stage total or subtotal aortic replacement for treatment of extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> is feasible with acceptable surgical risks and satisfactory results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It can eliminate the risk of remnant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture in staged total aortic replacement </plain></SENT>
