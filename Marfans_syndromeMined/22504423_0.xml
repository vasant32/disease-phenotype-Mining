<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The nature and cause of President Abraham Lincoln's unusual physical features have long been debated, with the greatest attention directed at two monogenic disorders of the transforming growth factor β system: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0100568'>endocrine neoplasia</z:hpo> type 2B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present report examines newly discovered phenotypic information about Lincoln's biological mother, Nancy Hanks Lincoln, and concludes that (a) Lincoln's mother was skeletally marfanoid, (b) the President and his mother were highly concordant for the presence of numerous facial features found in various transforming growth factor β disorders, and (c) Lincoln's mother, like her son, had hypotonic skeletal muscles, resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002058'>myopathic facies</z:hpo> and 'pseudodepression' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These conclusions establish that mother and son had the same monogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> marfanoid disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A description of Nancy Hanks Lincoln as coarse-featured, and a little-known statement that a <z:mp ids='MP_0005150'>wasting</z:mp> disease contributed to her <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at age 34, lends support to the multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0100568'>endocrine neoplasia</z:hpo> type 2B hypothesis </plain></SENT>
