<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography was more sensitive than physical examination in detecting valvular and aortic root abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although physical examination revealed findings of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264765,C0026265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral valve disease</z:e> and/or of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> in 52 percent of patients (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264765,C0026265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral valve disease</z:e> in 44 percent and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> in 23 percent), echocardiography detected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001633'>abnormalities of the mitral valve</z:hpo> and/or aortic root in 82 percent of patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> in 57 percent and aortic root enlargement in 69 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> was approximately equal in male and female patients, whereas aortic root enlargement was more frequent in males (83 percent) than in females (50 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographically detected aortic root enlargement was frequently not apparent on chest x-ray films </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indeed, five patients with markedly <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>increased aortic root diameters</z:hpo> (ranging from 6.0 to 7.9 cm) had no evident enlargement of the aortic root on routine chest x-ray films </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four of those patients who had angiographic and/or pathologic correlations, confirmation of marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There are limitations to echocardiographic evaluation of the presence and severity of underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, due to anteroposterior compression of the left atrium by the enlarged aorta, left atrial size may be underestimated in patients with aortic root enlargement </plain></SENT>
