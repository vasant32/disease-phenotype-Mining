<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Chiari type I malformation (CMI; OMIM 118420) is narrowly defined when the tonsils of the cerebellum extend below the foramen magnum, leading to a variety of neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is widely thought that a small posterior fossa (PF) volume, relative to the total cranial volume leads to a cramped cerebellum and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> of the tonsils into the top of the spinal column </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a collection of magnetic resonance imagings (MRIs) from affected individuals and their family members, we measured correlations between ten cranial <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphologies</z:mp> and estimated their heritability in these families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlations between bones delineating the PF and significant heritability of PF volume (0.955, P = 0.003) support the cramped PF theory and a genetic basis for this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a collection of 23 families with 71 affected individuals, we performed a genome wide linkage screen of over 10,000 SNPs across the genome to identify regions of linkage to CMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two-point LOD scores on chromosome 15 reached 3.3 and multipoint scores in this region identified a 13 cM region with LOD scores over 1 (15q21.1-22.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This region contains a biologically plausible gene for CMI, fibrillin-1, which is a major gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and has been linked to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1321551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome</z:e>, of which CMI is a distinguishing characteristic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multipoint LOD scores on chromosome 9 maximized at 3.05, identifying a 40 cM region with LOD scores over 1 (9q21.33-33.1) and a tighter region with multipoint LOD scores over 2 that was only 8.5 cM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This linkage evidence supports a genetic role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> and justifies further exploration with fine mapping and investigation of candidate genes in these regions </plain></SENT>
