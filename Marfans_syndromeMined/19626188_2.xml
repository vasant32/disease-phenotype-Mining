<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They have in common a dramatically increased risk of life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0002622'>dissecting aortic aneurysms</z:hpo>, which must be prevented by elective aortic replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Selective review of the literature supplemented by own clinical experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and Marfan-related syndromes are phenotypically highly variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The full-blown clinical picture is not always present, and particular symptoms can be missing altogether </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, it is often very difficult to diagnose a specific syndrome in the individual patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In many cases, only a combination of genetic tests and clinical assessment can settle the differential diagnosis, thus enabling better prognostication and better planning of preventive measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The diagnosis and treatment of individual patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and Marfan-related syndromes requires an interdisciplinary approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This can only be achieved through a coordination of medical care with centralized record-keeping of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diagnostic findings </plain></SENT>
