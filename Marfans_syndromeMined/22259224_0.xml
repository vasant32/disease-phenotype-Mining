<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Transforming growth factor beta receptor II (TGFBR2) gene mutations are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>; however, the relationship between the mutations and clinical phenotypes are not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genomic DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes of a Chinese proband with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, five of the proband's relatives, and 100 unrelated Chinese control subjects were isolated and screened for fibrillin-1 (FBN1) and TGFBR2 gene mutations by direct sequencing, and a genotype-phenotype study was performed following a review of the literature on TGFBR2 mutations in the search area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Also, the structure of TGFBR2 protein before and after gene mutation was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results identified a novel missense TGFBR2 mutation p.V453E (c.1358T&gt;A) in the proband and two relatives that was located in the F-helix in the kinase domain of TGFBR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No such genetic change was observed in the unrelated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No FBN1 mutation was detected in any of the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genotype-phenotype analyses indicated that F-helix mutations are related to type 2 Marfan syndrome and Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and these mutations can lead to severe cardiovascular (93.8%) and skeletal (81.3%) lesions and minor ocular lesions (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">Losartan</z:chebi> treatment can slow-down the progression of aortic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The ﬁndings extend the mutation spectrum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and that mutations at the F-helix in the kinase domain of TGFBR2 may be associated with the development of severe cardiovascular and skeletal lesions and minor ocular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings have implications for genetic testing, diagnosis, and treatment in individuals with transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling-related disorders </plain></SENT>
