<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various factors prompted considering LTBP2 in the etiology of isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> and associated conditions such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265313" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Weill-Marchesani syndrome</z:e> (WMS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LTBP2 was screened in 30 unrelated Iranian patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations were found only in one WMS proband and one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> proband </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Homozygous c.3529G&gt;A (p.Val1177Met) was shown to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> WMS or WM-like syndrome by several approaches, including homozygosity mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Light, fluorescent, and electron microscopy evidenced disruptions of the microfibrillar network in the ECM of the proband's skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conjunction with recent findings regarding other ECM proteins, the results presented strongly support the contention that anomalies in WMS patients are due to disruptions in the ECM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Heterozygous c.1642C &gt;T (p.Arg548*) possibly contributed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>-related phenotypes, including ocular manifestations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo>, but was not cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
