<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the authors' experience of 313 patients operated for pure <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, approximately 30% had dystrophic lesions and this was the second most common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentation is variable: excluding annulo-aortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath>, the other features of dystrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> are less well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighty-nine cases without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the ascending thoracic aorta were recensed and analysed in a French Cooperative study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were divided into two groups with respect to the diameter of the ascending aorta measured by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of late postoperative complications of the ascending aorta was higher in patients with a dilated aorta </plain></SENT>
