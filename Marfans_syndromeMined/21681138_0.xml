<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients with nonadolescent idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> who underwent open vertebral stapling for treatment of spinal deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of vertebral stapling in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Measurements included initial deformity correction and maintenance of correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Growth modulation has become a topic of interest recently in the spinal deformity literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It refers to the tethering of growth on one side of the spine to allow for compensatory growth on the contralateral side, and, in theory, correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recent studies on endoscopic vertebral stapling have shown promising early results in adolescents with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Little is known about its applicability in patients with more "malignant" types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical records and radiographs of 11 children who underwent open vertebral stapling between June 2003 and August 2004 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with adolescent idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> (AIS) were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS.: Diagnoses included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, juvenile, and infantile idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, paralytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, and neuromuscular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The average age at surgery was 6 + 11 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were skeletally immature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Preoperative curves averaged 68° (22°-105°) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of the 11, six thoracic curves and five thoracolumbar curves were stapled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Four patients had minor curves, which were not stapled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Initial postoperative radiographs averaged 45° (24°-88°) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Average follow-up was 22 month for our series (16-28 month) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>At final follow-up, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> averaged 69° (36°-107°) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Five of the 11 patients have subsequently undergone secondary surgical procedures for progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, including growing rod insertion in three, combined anterior/posterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>spinal fusion</z:hpo> in another, and bilateral vertical expandable prosthetic <z:chebi fb="55" ids="33341">titanium</z:chebi> rib insertion in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Three of the remaining six patients are scheduled for secondary surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: More than half of the patients in our series have undergone or are scheduled to undergo further spinal surgery, at an average of 2 year after anterior vertebral stapling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>It is unclear if progression may be related to the young age at surgery, the relatively severe average preoperative curve magnitude, the nature of the underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, or a combination of these </plain></SENT>
