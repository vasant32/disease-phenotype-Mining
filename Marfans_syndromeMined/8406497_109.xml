<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This disorder is characterized by marked inter- and intrafamilial variation in phenotypic severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To understand the molecular basis for this clinical observation, we have screened the fibrillin gene (FBN1) on chromosome 15, including the newly cloned 5' coding sequence, for disease-producing alterations in a panel of patients with a wide range of manifestations and clinical severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the missense mutations identified to date, including two novel mutations discussed here, are associated with classic and moderate to severe disease and occur at residues with putative significance for calcium binding to epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, two new mutations that create premature signals for termination of translation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and are associated with reduction in the amount of mutant allele transcript produce a range of phenotypic severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient with the lowest amount of mutant transcript has the mildest disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data support a role for altered calcium binding to EGF-like domains in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and suggest a dominant negative mechanism for the pathogenesis of this disorder </plain></SENT>
