<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a case illustrating this problem and its resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional echocardiography and contrast ventriculography revealed a space adjacent to the aortic valve conduit that demonstrated marked systolic expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dynamic variation of this space was secondary to communication with the left ventricular cavity caused by disruption of the composite graft valve ring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, systolic expansion of the aortic root is a useful echocardiographic and angiographic sign of composite graft dehiscence </plain></SENT>
