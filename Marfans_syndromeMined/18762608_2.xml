<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective medical record review and echocardiographic reanalysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of New York-Presbyterian </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Surgical candidates with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> (n = 37) and age-matched controls (n = 44) referred for an echocardiogram from 1994 to 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Two-dimensional and color Doppler transthoracic echocardiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OUTCOME MEASURES: The aortic annulus and root were measured and z scores were calculated and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Medical records were reviewed for genetic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> and age-matched controls were reanalyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in age, weight, height, or body surface area between patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the mean aortic annulus diameter, mean aortic annulus z score, or mean aortic root measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the aortic root z score was significantly higher in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> group compared with the controls: 0.9 (SD, 1.06) vs 0.0 (SD, 1.25) (P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were more patients with an aortic root z score of 2 or greater in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> group (9 of 37 patients) than in the control group (0 of 43 controls), with a calculated odds ratio of 29.7 (95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Genetic evaluation was performed in 5 patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0011575'>dilated aortic root</z:mp>; 2 of them received diagnoses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>Aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> is more common in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> than in a control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic screening may be useful in the identification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> in patients with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
