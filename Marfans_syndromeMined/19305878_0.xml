<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were obtained from 42 patients who underwent the Bentall procedure between 1991 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Different parameters were compared as well as the short and long term results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age was 58,5 years being 88% of patients of male gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>32 (76,27%) presented with ascending aorta degenerative aneurism, 6 p (14,3%) with type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and 4p (9,5%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>10p(23.8%) had associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and there were 6p (14.3%) who underwent emergency surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the risk factors associated, 24 p (57,1%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, 12 p (28,6%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, 4p (9,5%) had history of smoking, 7 p (16,7%) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 6 p (14,3%) CPOD, 2 p (4,8%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> and 2 had a recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 7p (16,7%) with left ventricular dysfunction (EF&lt;40%); 25 p were in NYHA class II-III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The hospitalar mortality was of 2,77% in non-emergent cases, and 33,3% in emergent operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 30 days, 92,8% of patients were alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 1-year survival was 90,4% and after 5 years of 85,7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Bentall procedure obtained good results in short and long term and, despite the emerging of new and more complex techniques like remodelling and reimplantation, our results support the maintenance of this procedure as the preferential treatment for aortic root and valvular disease </plain></SENT>
