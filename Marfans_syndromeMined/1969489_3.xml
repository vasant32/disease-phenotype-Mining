<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two of three families tested showed negative scores using D1S7 but a third family gave a positive score (0.92) at theta = 0.1 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Negative lod scores with two chromosome 11q22 markers (D11S84, D11S148) excluded at least 20 cM in this area (Z = less than -2), which was chosen for study as two enzymes responsible for collagen degradation (collagenase and stromelysin) are localised to this region </plain></SENT>
