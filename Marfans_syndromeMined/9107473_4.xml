<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four patients showed some marfanoid features (span more than height, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000156'>high arched palate</z:hpo>), and generalized hyper-reflexia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two affected males and the younger female also had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Features only present in the affected males included <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>amyotrophy</z:hpo> of the distal muscles, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002380'>fasciculations</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003693'>distal muscle wasting</z:hpo> in the two affected brothers reflected the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003477'>axonal neuropathy</z:hpo> demonstrated both electrophysiologically and by nerve biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although neither of the sisters had any degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003693'>distal muscle wasting</z:hpo>, both had reduced M-wave amplitude of the tibial and peroneal nerves, bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The described phenotype does not fit any of the recognized forms of hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002313'>spastic paraparesis</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003693'>distal muscle wasting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0003477'>axonal neuropathy</z:hpo> differentiates it from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">familial motor neuron disease</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reported phenotype represents a possible new Troyer-like syndrome similar to that described by Neuh√§user (1976), but differs from it by the lack of major dysmorphic features </plain></SENT>
