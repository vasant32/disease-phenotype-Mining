<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of the R618Q proalpha2(I)collagen allele in unaffected or mildly affected family members suggests that the R618Q allele is either a non-affecting polymorphism or a potential genetic modifier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conservation of arginine618 across species and fibrillar collagen types suggests it is functionally significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate the functional significance of the R618Q proalpha2(I)collagen allele, we isolated type I collagen from cultured dermal fibroblasts of control and two unrelated individuals heterozygous for the R618Q proalpha2(I)collagen allele and evaluated helical stability and fibrillar assembly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type I collagen thermal stability analyzed by protease susceptibility and CD spectroscopy demonstrated no statistical difference between control and R618Q containing collagen molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro fibril assembly analyses demonstrated that R618Q containing collagen exhibits rapid fibrillar growth with minimal fibril nucleation phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, electron microscopy demonstrated that the diameter of assembled R618Q containing collagen fibrils was approximately 20% of control collagen fibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest the R618Q variant does not impact triple helical stability but has a role in collagen fibril assembly, supporting the hypothesis that the R618Q proalpha2(I)collagen variant is a modifier of connective tissue structure/function and is potentially involved in disease pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
