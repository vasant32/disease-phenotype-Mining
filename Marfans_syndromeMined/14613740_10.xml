<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 107 patients subdivided into three subgroups based on the severity of cardiovascular manifestations: (A) no involvement (n=4); (B) mild involvement (n=45); (C) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (n=58), and 189 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (tHcy) was significantly higher in subgroup C than in subgroup B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In subgroup C patients with dissection tHcy was higher than in those without dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In subgroup C the prevalence of 677T homozygotes was higher, but not significantly, than in the subgroup B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with dissection the prevalence of 677T homozygotes was significantly higher than in those without dissection and than in subgroup B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the logistic regression analysis, severe cardiovascular manifestations and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in Marfan patients were associated with tHcy plasma levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate an association between the severity of the cardiovascular manifestations, in particular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, and elevated tHcy levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests an important role for tHcy in determining <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>phenotypic variability</z:hpo> in Marfan patients and provides further evidence for the association of homocysteinemia with the damage of the vascular system </plain></SENT>
