<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, mitral leaflet thickness was 3.5 +/- 0.8 mm (mean +/- standard deviation) and the mitral leaflet thickness to aortic wall thickness ratio was 1.0 +/- 0.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with MVP were separated into 2 groups: those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mitral thickness (less than or equal to mean + 2 SD observed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, i.e., less than or equal to 5.1 mm) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mitral thickness to aortic wall thickness ratio (less than or equal to mean + 2 SD observed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, i.e., less than or equal to 1.4) (group I) and others in whom these values were increased (group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In group I, mitral thickness was 3.6 +/- 0.6 mm and mitral thickness to aortic wall thickness ratio was 1.1 +/- 0.1, and in group II, mitral thickness was 8.8 +/- 1.2 mm and mitral thickness to aortic wall thickness ratio was 2.2 +/- 0.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The only significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001626'>cardiovascular abnormalities</z:hpo> in group I were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> in 2 patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001704'>tricuspid valve prolapse</z:hpo> in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In group II, 7 patients had clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo>, 8 had aortic root abnormalities, 4 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001704'>tricuspid valve prolapse</z:hpo> and 6 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001626'>Cardiovascular abnormalities</z:hpo> were present in 60% (18 of 30) of patients in group II and in 6% (3 of 56) of patients in group I (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional echo enabled the identification of a subset of patients with MVP who had thickened mitral leaflets </plain></SENT>
