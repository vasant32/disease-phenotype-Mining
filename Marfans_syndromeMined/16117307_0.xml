<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the early results of a three-year experience with the minimally invasive correction of pectum excavatum, which requires no cartilage incision or excision, and no sternal osteotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since 2001 we have performed 35 minimally invasive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> procedures at our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A convex steel bar is inserted under the sternum through small bilateral incisions, and removed after 2 years when permanent remolding had occured, the bar is removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complications were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo> in 5 patients (only 1 required a thoracostomy tube, the other 4 resolved spontaneously), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> in 3 patients, and bar displacement in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 3 months to 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Initial excellent results were maintained in 28 patients (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> postoperative chest), good results in 5patients (mild residual pectus) and poor in 2 patients (severe recurrence requiring further treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Poor results occurred because the steel bar was too soft in 1 patient, and the sternum too soft in 1 patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our early results with the minimally invesive technique without cartilage incision and resection or sternal osteotomy showed that the procedure is effective with excellent preliminary results </plain></SENT>
