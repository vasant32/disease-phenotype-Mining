<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The volume overload of isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) in the dog results in left ventricular (LV) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and interstitial collagen loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To better understand the mechanism of collagen loss, we performed a gene array and overlaid regulated genes into ingenuity pathway analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Gene arrays from LV tissue were compared in 4 dogs before and 4 months after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cine-magnetic resonance-derived LV end-diastolic volume increased 2-fold (P=0.005), and LV ejection fraction increased from 41% to 53% (P&lt;0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LV interstitial collagen decreased 40% (P&lt;0.05) compared with controls, and replacement collagen was in short strands and in disarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ingenuity pathway analysis identified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation, LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which have extracellular matrix protein defects and/or degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinase-1 and -9 mRNA increased 5- (P=0.01) and 10-fold (P=0.003), whereas collagen I did not change and collagen III <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> increased 1.5-fold (P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, noncollagen genes important in extracellular matrix structure were significantly downregulated, including decorin, fibulin 1, and fibrillin 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, connective tissue growth factor and plasminogen activator inhibitor were downregulated, along with multiple genes in the transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway, resulting in decreased LV transforming growth factor-beta1 activity (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LV collagen loss in isolated, compensated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> is chiefly due to posttranslational processing and degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The downregulation of multiple noncollagen genes important in global extracellular matrix structure, coupled with decreased expression of multiple profibrotic factors, explains the failure to replace interstitial collagen in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> heart </plain></SENT>
