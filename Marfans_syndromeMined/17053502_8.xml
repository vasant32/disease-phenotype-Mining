<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This review discusses mutant-fibrillin mouse models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and SSc (Tsk mice), and studies suggesting that alterations in microfibrils might contribute to human SSc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: Fibrillin-1 mutations associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> have recently been shown to induce genes activated by TGF-beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of TGF-beta in these mouse models largely reverses phenotypic and pathologic disease manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that alterations in the fibrillin-1 structure from mutant Tsk fibrillin cause hypodermal <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and associated changes in dermal gene expression, suggesting stimulation of cytokine-mediating signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genetic mutations in fibrillin-1, in a higher frequency in SSc patient populations, and autoantibodies to fibrillin provide potential links to human SSc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: Fibrillin is placed centrally not only as the primary structural component of microfibrils, but also a key regulator of cytokines in the TGF-beta superfamily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin may thus communicate alterations in matrix to fibroblast gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These observations complement emerging understandings of the effects of Tsk fibrillin, and genetic and autoimmune studies of human fibrillin on dermal <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
