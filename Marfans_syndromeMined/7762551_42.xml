<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Single-strand conformation analysis of the entire fibrillin-1 (FBN1) cDNA of an affected family member revealed a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 3379, predicting a Gly1127Ser substitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The glycine in this position is highly conserved in EGF-like domains of FBN1 and other proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This mutation was present in 9 of 10 affected family members and in 1 young unaffected member but was not found in other unaffected members, in 168 chromosomes from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, and in 188 chromosomes from other individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> or related phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FBN1 intragenic marker haplotypes ruled out the possibility that the other allele played a significant role in modulating the phenotype in this family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pulse-chase studies revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fibrillin synthesis but reduced fibrillin deposition into the extracellular matrix in cultured fibroblasts from a Gly1127Ser carrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We postulate that the Gly1127Ser FBN1 mutation is responsible for reduced matrix deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that mutations such as this one may disrupt EGF-like domain folding less drastically than do substitutions of cysteine or of other amino acids important for calcium-binding that cause classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Gly1127Ser mutation, therefore, produces a mild form of autosomal dominantly inherited <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of elastic tissue, which predisposes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> and dissection later in life </plain></SENT>
