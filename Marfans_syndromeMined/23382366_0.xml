<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We propose that the effects of older PAC are likely to be broad and harmful in some domains of health but beneficial in others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Harmful effects of older PAC have received the most attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, for example, older PAC is associated with an increased risk of offspring having rare conditions such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, as well as with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1535926" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neurodevelopmental disorders</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, newly emerging evidence in the telomere field suggests potentially beneficial effects, since older PAC is associated with a longer leukocyte telomere length (LTL) in offspring, and a longer LTL is associated with a reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and with increased survival in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, older PAC may cumulatively increase resistance to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and lengthen lifespan in successive generations of modern humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this paper we: (i) introduce these novel findings; (ii) discuss potential explanations for the effect of older PAC on offspring LTL; (iii) draw implications for population health and for life course; (iv) put forth an evolutionary perspective as a context for the multigenerational effects of PAC; and (v) call for broad and intensive research to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of PAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We draw together work across a range of disciplines to offer an integrated perspective of this issue </plain></SENT>
