<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over the past 40 years, surgery to the aortic root and thoracoabdominal aorta has resulted in a significantly prolonged life expectancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More recently, techniques for endovascular repair of the aortic complications of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this article we review the relative merits of open and endovascular approaches to thoracic aortic complications in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, comparing outcomes from contemporary literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A reasonably large body of evidence has developed concerning the surgical treatment of the aortic root, ascending thoracic aorta, and arch in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is clear from large series that pathology, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissections and aneurysmal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, can be successfully repaired with low mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recently published series, although reporting smaller numbers, have demonstrated that the same is true for open surgical replacement of descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The evidence for thoracic endovascular aortic repair in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> is much more limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Small series and registry or case reports describe a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of patients with only short-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Outcomes of endovascular repair are mixed, with questionable longevity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reoperation is, however, common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, and minimally invasive techniques may provide a bridging role or alternative solution when revisiting the hostile surgical field </plain></SENT>
