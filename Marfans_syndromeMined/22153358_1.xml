<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To compare the biomechanical properties of the cornea and intraocular pressure (IOP) between patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Departments of Ophthalmology and Genetics, Bakirkoy Maternity and Children Diseases Hospital, and Beyoglu Eye Education and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study comprised patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (study group) and healthy individuals (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study group was subdivided into patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> and patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the right eye of each patient, the corneal hysteresis (CH), corneal resistance factor (CRF), Goldman-correlated IOP, and corneal-compensated IOP were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, the mean CH, CRF, Goldman-correlated IOP, and corneal-compensated IOP were not significantly different between the study group and the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean CH was 9.9 mm Hg ± 1.2 (SD) in study eyes with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> and 11.2 ± 1.5 mm Hg in study eyes without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> (P=.016); the mean CRF was 8.2 ± 1.8 mm Hg and 11.3 ± 1.9 mm Hg, respectively (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean Goldman-correlated IOP was 11.7 ± 2.7 mm Hg in study eyes with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> and 16.2 ± 4.3 in study eyes without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> (P=.003); the mean corneal-compensated IOP was 13.5 ± 4.1 mm Hg and 15.6 ± 3.8 mm Hg, respectively (P=.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The CH, CRF, and Goldman-correlated IOP were significantly lower in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> eyes with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> than in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> eyes without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
