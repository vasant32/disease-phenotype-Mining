<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These features are present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi>: monogenic forms [mainly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>)], forms associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp>), and degenerative forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initially described in a mouse model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, the transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)/Smad2 signalling pathway is now assumed to play a role in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> of various aetiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the relation between the aetiological diversity and the common <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> with respect to TGF-β signalling remains unexplained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: This study was performed on human aortic samples, including <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, n = 14; <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp>, n = 15; and degenerative, n = 19] and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aortas (n = 10) from which tissue extracts and human SMCs and fibroblasts were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> share a complex dysregulation of Smad2 signalling, independent of TGF-β1 in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi>-derived SMCs (pharmacological study, qPCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Smad2 dysregulation is characterized by an SMC-specific, heritable activation and overexpression of Smad2, compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aortas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cell specificity and heritability of this overexpression strongly suggest the implication of epigenetic control of Smad2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate that the increases in H3K9/14 acetylation and H3K4 methylation are involved in Smad2 overexpression in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi>, in a cell-specific and transcription start site-specific manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate the heritability, the cell specificity, and the independence with regard to TGF-β1 and genetic backgrounds of the Smad2 dysregulation in human thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms regulating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> marks in this process </plain></SENT>
