<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The ocular findings in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo> due to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17755">cystathionine</z:chebi>-beta-synthetase (CBS) deficiency are reviewed and a new approach to lens surgery is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lens surgery in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CBS deficiency</z:e> was reported to be accompanied by a high risk of secondary complications like vitreal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>So far an operative procedure for these patients that allows a complete preservation of the anterior vitreous cortex, the posterior lens capsule and an implantation of an artificial lens is not established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A minimal invasive method of lens surgery was developed in vitro and applied in the case of a 10-year-old patient with an uncorrectable refractive situation due to progressed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>lens dislocation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Principle steps of the evolved operative procedure are (1) visco-elastic stabilization of the anterior chamber; (2) small (1.5 mm) peripheral capsulorhexis; (3) manual endocapsular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> of lens material and removal of lens epithelium; (4) ab externo introduction of a transcleral fixation suture; (5) positioning of the haptic into the ciliary sulcus in the inferior position; (6) resection of the anterior lens capsule; and (7) positioning of the second haptic into the ciliary sulcus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first patient treated according to this method presented a stable position of the pseudophakos during the follow up of 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity improved from a level of 20/200 (O.D.) and 10/200 (O.S.) to 18/20 in both eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The surgical procedure presented in this report seems to be useful for dealing with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>dislocated lenses</z:hpo> due to zonular deficiency in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CBS deficiency</z:e> and hopefully with Marfan disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It allows a minimal invasive removal of the lens, a complete preservation of the anterior vitreous cortex and at the same time a stable fixation of an artificial intraocular lens </plain></SENT>
