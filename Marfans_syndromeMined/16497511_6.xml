<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1997 and 2004, 69 aortic valvuloplasties were performed with a new technique addressing the three main components of the aortic root; leaflets (L), sinotubular junction (STJ), and aortic annulus (A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For leaflet correction, additional leaflets were implanted and for STJ and annular reduction, an internal synthetic ring and strip along the fibrous annulus were implanted, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into two groups: 30 patients with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> (group IAR) were treated by correction of STJ+L (n=21) and STJ+A+L (n=9), and 39 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> patients with annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> (group AAR) were treated with STJ correction only (n=16), STJ+A (n=6), STJ+L (n=9), and STJ+A+L (n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age was 43.4 and 49.5 years for groups IAR and AAR, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was neither operative nor follow-up <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Suture breakage caused one reoperation in group IAR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 13.8 and 20.3 months in groups IAR and AAR, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> grade was 3.67 in group IAR and 2.67 in group AAR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The last follow-up <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> grade was 1.1 in group IAR and 1.05 in group AAR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patient, except for the reoperated patient had AR greater than grade 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The postoperative pressure gradient was 19.3 mmHg in group IAR and 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>4mmHg in group AAR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results showed this technique to be safe and effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thus far broad application of this repair technique has been demonstrated to be highly feasible </plain></SENT>
