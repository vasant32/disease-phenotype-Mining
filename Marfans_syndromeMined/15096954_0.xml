<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The understanding of the etiology of congenital cardiac lesions is rapidly progressing from the recognition of embryologic origins to insight into the genetic basis for these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Concurrently, in this era, great effort is being expended to gather data that will generate clinically useful genotype-phenotype correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This rapidly evolving area of inquiry, in which the clinical implications of mutation status are fully explored, makes available information applicable to those involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aspects of congenital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: Three syndromes with cardiovascular phenotypes were selected for review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each has received a great deal of attention in the recent past based on improved understanding of the range of mutations expressed and the relation of these mutations to clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These three syndromes--Noonan, Marfan, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo>--span the range of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> and provide examples of genotype-phenotype correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: Better understanding of the clinical implications of specific mutations should allow not only for more sensitive and specific diagnoses to be made but also for improvements in therapeutic options and efficacy </plain></SENT>
