<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>From a large series of 1009 probands with pathogenic FBN1 mutations, data for 320 patients &lt;18 years of age at the last follow-up evaluation were analyzed (32%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the time of diagnosis, the median age was 6.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the last examination, the population was classified as follows: neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, 14%; severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, 19%; classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, 32%; probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, 35% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-one percent had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004970'>ascending aortic dilation</z:hpo>, 55% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo>, and 28% major skeletal system involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Even when aortic complications existed in childhood, the rates of aortic surgery and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> remained low (5% and 1%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some diagnostic features (major skeletal system involvement, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001065'>striae</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo>, and family history) were more frequent in the 10- to &lt;18-year age group, whereas others (<z:hpo ids='HP_0004970'>ascending aortic dilation</z:hpo> and mitral abnormalities) were more frequent in the population with neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 56% of children could be classified as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, according to international criteria, at their last follow-up evaluation when the presence of a FBN1 mutation was not considered as a major feature, with increasing frequency in the older age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five percent of child probands fulfilled international criteria after molecular studies, which indicates that the discovery of a FBN1 mutation can be a valuable <z:chebi fb="6" ids="33295">diagnostic aid</z:chebi> in uncertain cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The distributions of mutation types and locations in this pediatric series revealed large proportions of probands carrying mutations located in exons 24 to 32 (33%) and in-frame mutations (75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Apart from lethal neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, we confirm that the majority of clinical manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> increase with age, which emphasizes the poor applicability of the international criteria to this diagnosis in childhood and the need for follow-up monitoring in cases of clinical suspicion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
