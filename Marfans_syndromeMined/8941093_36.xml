<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Mutations in the FBN1 gene are the cause of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> disorder with skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> or dissections of the ascending thoracic aorta are the major cardiovascular complications of the disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that FBN1 mutations cause thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> or dissections in patients who do not have the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The FBN1 gene was screened for mutations by use of genomic DNA from two patients with thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> who did not have the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individual FBN1 exons were amplified with intron-based exon-specific primers; the DNA fragments were screened for mutations using single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis; and aberrantly migrating bands were sequenced directly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified a missense mutation in one patient, D1155N in exon 27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dermal fibroblasts from the affected individual were used to study the effect of the missense mutation D1155N on fibrillin-1 cellular processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mutation decreased the amount of fibrillin-1 deposited into the pericellular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A second putative FBN1 mutation was identified in the second patient, P1837S in exon 44 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although this alteration was not observed in 234 chromosomes from unrelated individuals, the alteration may represent a rare polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results of these studies support the hypothesis that FBN1 mutations cause thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> in patients who do not have the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This information is important for understanding the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and identification of individuals at risk for developing thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> or dissections </plain></SENT>
