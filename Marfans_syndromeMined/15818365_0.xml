<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cardinal features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> are the abnormalities of the skeleton (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000098'>tall stature</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo>, and joint hyperelasticity), eye (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001132'>lens subluxation</z:hpo>), and aorta (root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with proclivity toward rupture and dissection) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aortic catastrophe accounts for most of the premature mortality among Marfan patients, a risk that climbs steeply during adolescence and results in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of half of Marfan patients by the age of 40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most of the improvement in life expectancy that has been achieved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is attributable to early recognition of aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and prophylactic replacement with composite grafts (mechanical valve prostheses within Dacron conduits) before rupture or dissection occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite the excellent early and late results with composite grafts, there has been growing interest in operative procedures that replace the sinuses but preserve the aortic valve leaflets, to avoid anticoagulation and minimize the risk of prosthesis-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These procedures are still in evolution and late results are not yet known, but as with mitral repair in the setting of myxomatous disease, valve-sparing procedures in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> have weathered a storm of initial criticism and skepticism and are steadily gaining acceptance </plain></SENT>
