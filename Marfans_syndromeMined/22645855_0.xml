<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Marfan patients with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> are typically treated with the Bentall procedure, though aortic valve-sparing procedures (AVSPs) are also possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study aim was to compare the authors' experience with two such techniques performed at their institution, namely a reimplantation according to David (David I) and remodeling according to Yacoub </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1996 and 2009, a total of 37 Marfan patients underwent an AVSP at the authors' institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 25 (mean age 32 +/- 14.9 years) underwent surgery according to David (group D), and 12 (mean age 35 +/- 10.9 years) according to Yacoub (group Y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients underwent both clinical and echocardiographic follow up examinations at a mean of 42.0 +/- 36.4 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One patient from each group had moved abroad and was lost to follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining 35 patients were alive at follow up, and none presented with any major neurological or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, no significant differences were noted between the groups in terms of NYHA classification, left ventricular function, or left ventricular diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At follow up, aortic valve function was also comparable between groups, with a peak/mean gradient of 9.4 +/- 6.4/5.3 +/- 3.5 mmHg and 5.1 +/- 3.3/2.8 +/- 1.5 mmHg for groups D and Y, respectively (p = 0.081/0.058) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The measured mean grades of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic valve regurgitation</z:hpo> were comparable in groups D and Y (0.6 +/- 0.7 and 1.1 +/- 0.6, respectively; p = 0.055) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, aortic root dimensions obtained via M-mode were smaller in group D patients (29.6 +/- 2.3 mm) than in group Y patients (36.1 +/- 6.6 mm) (p = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only three patients from group Y required reoperation on the aortic valve due to valvular regurgitation (p = 0.028); two of these had presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> at the first operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Both types of AVSP can be performed with comparably good interim clinical results, and also low mortality and morbidity, in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
