<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe an endovascular treatment option for (late) vascular complications after anterior spinal instrumentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Severe progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> is a well-known feature in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although overall complication rate after surgical correction of the spinal deformity is rather high, late iatrogenic complications are less frequently identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 40-year-old woman with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's disease</z:e> reported to our outpatient clinic with dyspnoe d'effort, 20 years after anterior spinal instrumentation of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002944'>thoracolumbar scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Routine screening identified a saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the descending thoracic aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed that the most proximal screw of the construct had perforated the vessel wall and caused a false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An endovascular approach to the problem was chosen; by a transfemoral approach, an AneuRx endovascular graft was successfully implanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged within 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 5-year follow-up, the patient still has no clinical complaints, nor radiographic leakage nor recurrence of the false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> at contrast-enhanced CT screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Use of an endovascular graft is an adequate alternative for treatment of late vascular complications after anterior spinal instrumentation </plain></SENT>
