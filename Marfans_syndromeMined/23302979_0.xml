<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> is characterized by progressive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> is accelerated by pregnancy, exposing patients to an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Literature on the <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> management of delivery in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> consists only of case reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore conducted a retrospective review of medical records focusing on <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> management of delivery in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> in a national referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pregnant women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> who were followed at their institution over a 6-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen pregnancies in 15 patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The initial aortic root diameter was larger than 40 mm in 9 patients and larger than 45 mm in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients did not receive β-blockers throughout pregnancy because of poor tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient with an aortic root diameter of 47 mm did not receive β-blocker before 33 weeks' gestation because of late referral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This woman developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> at 37 weeks, requiring emergency cesarean delivery under general anesthesia followed by aortic repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirteen other patients underwent cesarean delivery, 1 under spinal anesthesia and 12 under general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>General anesthesia management included close arterial blood pressure monitoring, avoidance of <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp>, administration of opioids before delivery, and titrated nicardipine administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients (including one with intrauterine fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) underwent vaginal delivery under epidural <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> who received care in a multidisciplinary tertiary care setting that included active peripartum involvement of anesthesiologists had good clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
