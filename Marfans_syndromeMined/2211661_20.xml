<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Also, the amount of decorin <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> in the culture medium of the fibroblasts of this infant was markedly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When the effect of interleukin-1 beta on the transcription of decorin was tested in these fibroblasts, the response was deficient as compared to control fibroblasts whereas transcription of type I and III collagen genes and versican was stimulated normally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The decreased decorin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level, unresponsive to interleukin-1 beta in this lethally sick Marfan patient, stresses the significance of this <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> in the formation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> connective tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the low expression of this gene could be responsible for the connective tissue findings in this patient, representing a rare type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The identical finding in three other, unrelated Marfan individuals suggests a more general significance of deficient decorin expression in this disease </plain></SENT>
