<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The modified Bentall technique, which was reported by Svensson in 1992, is an aortic root composite valve graft replacement involving reimplantation of the left coronary ostium with a long interposed graft wrapping behind the composite graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The technique is technically advantageous, particularly for complicated or redo aortic roots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To justify the technique, the midterm outcome needs to be evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Since 1992, 40 patients (4 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>) underwent the modified Bentall technique (Svensson's modification) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 54.7 +/- 13.6 years, and 32 patients (80.0%) were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> hospital survivors have been consecutively followed with annual echocardiographic evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in 2007, multislice computed tomography was performed at 4.7 +/- 3.5 years (maximum, 14.9 years) postoperatively in 30 patients who had preserved renal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No patients have experienced any complications regarding the technique at the follow-up of 5.7 +/- 4.0 years (maximum, 14.9 years), although there were 2 hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> of emergency cases and 5 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> owing to noncardiac causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 35 patients (92.1% of hospital survivors), no structural complications were detected by multislice computed tomographies of the 30 patients or coronary angiograms of the remaining 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The consecutive echocardiographic follow-ups showed well-preserved left ventricular function with the most recent ejection fraction being 0.581 +/- 0.078 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This Svensson's modification technique was associated with favorable midterm outcomes by multislice computed tomography and consecutive echocardiographic evaluations, indicating long-lasting advantages as well as technical benefits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, the technique can be considered as a helpful and justifiable alternative method </plain></SENT>
