<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We reviewed the evolution of practice and late results of aortic root replacement (ARR) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> patients at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective clinical review of Marfan patients undergoing ARR at our institution was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up data were obtained from hospital and office records and from telephone contact with patients or their physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between September 1976 and September 2006, 372 Marfan syndrome patients underwent ARR: 269 had a Bentall composite graft, 85 had valve-sparing ARR, 16 had ARR with homografts, and 2 had ARR with porcine xenografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the first 24 years of the study, 85% received a Bentall graft; during the last 8 years, 61% had a valve-sparing procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no operative or hospital mortality among the 327 patients who underwent elective repair; there were 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> among the 45 patients (4.4%) who underwent emergent or urgent operative repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 74 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (70 Bentalls, 2 homograft, and 2 valve-sparing ARRs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequent causes of late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were dissection or rupture of the residual aorta (10 of 74) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (9 of 74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 85 patients who had a valve-sparing procedure, 40 had a David II remodeling operation; there was 1 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in this group, and 5 patients required late aortic valve replacement for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A David I reimplantation procedure using the De Paulis Valsalva graft has been used exclusively since May 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 44 patients in this last group have 0 to 1+ <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic surgical replacement of the ascending aorta in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> has low operative risk and can prevent aortic catastrophe in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Valve-sparing procedures, particularly using the reimplantation technique with the Valsalva graft, show promise but have not yet proven as durable as the Bentall </plain></SENT>
