<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent findings suggest that proteolysis, increased matrix metalloproteinase activity, and fragmentation of fibrillin-rich microfibrils in tissues of persons with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> contribute to the complex pathogenesis of this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we show that a fibrillin-1 fragment containing a EGFEPG sequence that conforms to a putative GxxPG elastin-binding protein (EBP) consensus sequence upregulates the expression and production of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 by up to ninefold in a cell culture system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A mutation of the GxxPG consensus sequence site abrogated the effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is the first demonstration of such an effect for ligands other than elastin fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Molecular dynamics analysis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25676">oligopeptides</z:chebi> with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> and mutant sequence support our biochemical results by predicting significant alterations of structural characteristics such as the potential for forming a type VIII beta-turn that are thought to be important for binding to the EBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that fibrillin-1 fragments may regulate MMP-1 expression, and that the dysregulation of MMPs related to fragmentation of fibrillin might contribute to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our Gene Ontology (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e>) analysis of the human proteome shows that proteins with multiple GxxPG motifs are highly enriched for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> terms related to the extracellular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Matrix proteins with multiple GxxPG sites include fibrillin-1, -2, and -3, elastin, fibronectin, laminin, and several tenascins and collagens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Some of these proteins have been associated with disorders involving alterations in MMP regulation, and the results of the present study suggest a potential mechanism for these observations </plain></SENT>
