<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) relies on defined clinical criteria (Ghent nosology), outlined by international expert opinion to facilitate accurate recognition of this genetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> syndrome and to improve patient management and counselling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These Ghent criteria, comprising a set of major and minor manifestations in different body systems, have proven to work well since with improving molecular techniques, confirmation of the diagnosis is possible in over 95% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, concerns with the current nosology are that some of the diagnostic criteria have not been sufficiently validated, are not applicable in children or necessitate expensive and specialised investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The recognition of variable clinical expression and the recently extended differential diagnosis further confound accurate diagnostic decision making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>--whether or not established correctly--can be stigmatising, hamper career <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspirations</z:hpo>, restrict life insurance opportunities, and cause psychosocial burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An international expert panel has established a revised Ghent nosology, which puts more weight on the cardiovascular manifestations and in which aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> are the cardinal clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the absence of any family history, the presence of these two manifestations is sufficient for the unequivocal diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In absence of either of these two, the presence of a bonafide FBN1 mutation or a combination of systemic manifestations is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the latter a new scoring system has been designed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this revised nosology, FBN1 testing, although not mandatory, has greater weight in the diagnostic assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Special considerations are given to the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> in children and alternative diagnoses in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We anticipate that these new guidelines may delay a definitive diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> but will decrease the risk of premature or misdiagnosis and facilitate worldwide discussion of risk and follow-up/management guidelines </plain></SENT>
