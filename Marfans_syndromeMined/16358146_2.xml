<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical cardiac manifestations and temporal evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in children; to estimate the incidence of annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>; and to evaluate tolerability and efficacy of beta-blockers in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During one year, 21 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> underwent serial clinical and echocardiographic examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Echocardiograms assessed: the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, aortic root diameter, mitral and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic valves regurgitation</z:hpo>, and aortic enlargement during beta-blocker therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients had two measurements of the aortic root taken one year apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The children were asymptomatic throughout the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mitral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> was found in 11 (52%) children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> occurred in 16 (76%) patients and found to be mild in 42.8%, moderate in 9.5%, and severe in 23.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of these patients underwent aortic valve replacement and repair of the ascending aorta by the Bentall-De Bono technique, with good results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Heart rate decreased by 13.6% (from 85 to 73 bpm; p &lt; 0.009) with the use of beta-blockers; however, aortic root diameter increased by 1.4 mm/year (p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One child could not be given beta-blockers due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>bronchial asthma</z:hpo>, and no significant side effects were observed in the remaining children, including one who also had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>bronchial asthma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The children remained asymptomatic throughout the study, the use of beta-blockers led to a significant decrease in heart rate, and no significant adverse effects were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Contrary to the literature, incidence of annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> was high among the study population, greater than that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, even during beta-blocker therapy </plain></SENT>
