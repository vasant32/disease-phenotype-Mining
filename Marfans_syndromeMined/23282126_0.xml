<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over 25 years (1984-2009), 252 patients underwent repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up for reoperation or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 6.9±5.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Operative mortality was 16% (41 of 252) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified one risk factor for operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>: presentation malperfusion (P=.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For operative survivors, 5-, 10-, and 20-year survival was 78%±3%, 59%±4%, and 24%±6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred earlier in patients with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (P=.02) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> (P=.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for late reoperation included male sex (P=.006), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (P&lt;.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004421'>elevated systolic blood pressure</z:hpo> (SBP, P&lt;.001), and absence of β-blocker therapy (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated at 10-year follow-up that patients who maintained SBP &lt;120 mm Hg had improved freedom from reoperation (92±5%) compared with those with SBP 120 mm Hg to 140 mm Hg (74%±7%) or &gt;140 mm Hg (49%±14%, P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 10-year follow-up, patients on β-blocker therapy experienced 86%±5% freedom from reoperation compared with only 57%±11% for those without (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Operative survival was decreased with preoperative malperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Long-term survival was dependent on comorbidities but not operative approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Reoperation was markedly increased in patients not on β-blocker therapy and decreased with improved SBP control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Strict control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> with β-blocker therapy is warranted following repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection </plain></SENT>
