<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During the last 45 months 21 cryopreserved homograft root replacements have been performed in 19 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ages of the patients ranged from 28 to 77 years; there were 15 men and four women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, four prosthetic and two native valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient underwent homograft aortic root replacement twice; one underwent concomitant homograft right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction for pulmonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Causes of aortic pathology in the other 13 patients included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> with valvular regurgitation in seven, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in two, and four <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten of the nineteen patients were undergoing reoperative procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were three hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at home of unknown cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two of the three patients who died in hospital had undergone redo cardiac procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dramatic functional class improvement was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Follow-up from 2 to 45 months in the fifteen survivors revealed no clinical or significant echocardiographic evidence of valvular regurgitation or recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We believe homograft root replacement provides an excellent method of reconstruction with several advantages unique to human valved conduits, including ease of handling, lack of synthetic nidus for recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, and absence of thrombogenic materials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Homografts should be considered the approach of choice in complex valvular and root infectious processes </plain></SENT>
