<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Transthoracic echocardiography is the first-line modality for cardiovascular imaging in adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (ACHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The windows of access that are possible with transthoracic echocardiography are, however, rarely adequate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The choice of further imaging depends on the clinical questions that remain to be addressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The strengths of MRI include comprehensive access and coverage, providing imaging of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parts of the right ventricle, the pulmonary arteries, pulmonary veins and aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cine images and velocity maps are acquired in specifically aligned planes, with stacks of cines or dynamic contrast angiography providing more comprehensive coverage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tissues can be characterised if necessary, and MRI provides relatively accurate measurements of biventricular function and volume flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These parameters are important in the assessment and follow-up of adults after repairs for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001669'>transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo> and after Fontan operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The superior spatial resolution and rapid acquisition of CT are invaluable in selected situations, including the visualisation of anomalous coronary or <z:mp ids='MP_0010635'>aortopulmonary collateral arteries</z:mp>, the assessment of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> patency after stenting and imaging in patients with pacemakers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ionising radiation is, however, a concern in younger patients who may need repeated investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adults with relatively complex conditions should ideally be imaged in a specialist ACHD centre, where dedicated echocardiographic and cardiovascular MRI services are a necessary facility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>General radiologists should be aware of the nature and pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo>, and should be alert for previously undiagnosed cases presenting in adulthood, including cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001680'>aortic coarctation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001643'>patent ductus arteriosus</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0010424'>double-chambered right ventricle</z:mp> and congenitally corrected transposition </plain></SENT>
