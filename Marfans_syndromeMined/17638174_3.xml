<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To compare the aortic compliance of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-sized aorta of adolescents with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and healthy controls using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> measurements of the aortic distensibility and pulse wave velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients (median age: 15 years) and 11 healthy subjects (23 [12 - 32] years) were examined at 1.5 T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> protocol included 2D steady-state free precession (SSFP)-CINE MRI of the aortic distensibility and PC-MRI of the pulse wave velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> measurements were positioned perpendicular to the descending aorta at the level of the diaphragm for assessing the changes in the aortic cross-sectional areas and additionally above and below this plane for assessing the pulse wave velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition contrast-enhanced 3D-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography was performed in adolescents with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> to exclude morphologic changes and to prove <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-sized aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with control subjects, adolescents with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> had significantly decreased distensibility and significantly increased pulse wave velocity (chi (2)-test, p = 0.0002) using an age-related non-linear regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The related aortic compliance was significantly decreased (chi (2)-test, p = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a good correlation between the two methods (r = 0.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A low intraobserver variability was found for both methods (&lt; or = 2 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MRI allows detecting abnormal elastic aortic wall properties already in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-sized aorta of adolescents with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Monitoring of these properties could be relevant for evaluating disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MRI has the potential value of compliance measurements for the follow-up and to guide therapy indications </plain></SENT>
