<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We enrolled a consecutive group of 50 patients, referred for consultation because of CSF leak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients have been carefully examined for the presence of connective tissue abnormalities, and based on findings, patients underwent genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ancillary diagnostic studies included echocardiography, eye exam, and histopathological examinations of skin and dura biopsies in selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified nine patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heritable connective tissue disorders</z:e>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e> and other unclassified forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In seven patients, spontaneous CSF leak was the first noted manifestation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that spontaneous CSF leaks are associated with a spectrum of connective tissue abnormalities and may be the first noted clinical presentation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We propose that there is a clinical basis for considering spontaneous CSF leak as a clinical manifestation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heritable connective tissue disorders</z:e>, and we suggest that patients with CSF leaks should be screened for connective tissue and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
