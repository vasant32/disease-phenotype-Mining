<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review from 2 regional Marfan subspecialty clinics was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between 1997 and 2007, 204 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and 17 children with Loeys-Dietz syndrome were followed serially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 35 were identified who had undergone cardiovascular surgery at 18 years of age or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic, echocardiographic, and surgical data were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Surgery was performed at a median of 3 years (0-15 years) after diagnosis and a mean age of 11.5 +/- 6.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aortic root replacement was the initial surgery in 30 patients, and mitral valve surgery was the initial surgery in 8 patients, with 3 patients undergoing both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aortic root replacement was performed using a composite root replacement in 9 patients and valve-sparing techniques in 21 patients (remodeling in 8 patients and reimplantation in 13 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight patients underwent reoperation at a mean of 4.7 +/- 3.0 years after aortic surgery: 3 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo>, 2 for dissection, 2 for valve <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and 1 for a distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adverse outcomes included reoperation in 8 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in 1 patient, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to dissection or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Variables associated with an adverse outcome included preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo>, valve replacement, and absence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with Marfan or Loeys-Dietz syndrome requiring surgery during childhood have a favorable long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Those undergoing valve-sparing root replacement or mitral valve repair have a low risk for reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy confers clinical benefit </plain></SENT>
