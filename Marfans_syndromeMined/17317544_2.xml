<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: There are multiple causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its etiology includes floppy valve, postinflammatory disease, infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, and other disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, there has been an increased tendency to remove only portions of the mitral valve, causing difficulty in the determination of etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to study the pathology and etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> from surgically removed specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Native mitral valve specimens surgically excised due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral insufficiency</z:hpo> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Etiology was determined according to macroscopic, microscopic, clinical, and operative findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 278 mitral valve specimens, 43% were classified as floppy valve, 31% as postinflammatory disease (presumably associated with rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>), 12% as infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, and 14% as miscellaneous group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In floppy valves, diffuse myxoid change and chordal rupture were the main findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In postinflammatory disease, moderate neovascularization and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory cell infiltration were most commonly found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aschoff bodies were found in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001796'>gram-positive</z:mp> cocci were found in 70% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the miscellaneous group, three cases were related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and one case was related to papillary muscle <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In comparison with postinflammatory disease, the posterior leaflet in the floppy valve had a significantly longer basal free-edge length, a more frequent chordal rupture, and an higher mean age of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Among completely and partially excised specimens with postinflammatory disease, there were no significant differences in microscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The three most common etiologies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> were floppy valve, postinflammatory disease, and infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Macroscopic, microscopic, clinical, and operative findings are important in the evaluation of etiology, especially in partially excised specimens </plain></SENT>
