<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Two-hundred three patients aged 53+/-16 years (mean+/-SD; 153 male, 50 female) underwent elective or urgent aortic root surgery from 1971 to 2000 for an aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>: 149 patients underwent a composite valve conduit reconstruction, and 54 patients underwent valve-preserving aortic root reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In-hospital and 30-day mortality was 4.0% (8/203) overall: for a composite valve conduit procedure, the corresponding value was 4.0% (6/149) and for valve-preserving procedure, 3.7% (2/54) (P=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Morbidity included 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (1%), 10 perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> (5%), and 8 reoperations for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years was 93% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 88% to 97%), 79% (95% CI = 71% to 87%), 67% (95% CI = 57% to 79%), and 52% (95% CI = 36% to 69%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Freedom from reoperation was 72% (95% CI = 54% to 86%) at 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complications with anticoagulation occurred in 29 patients; with valve <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, in 2; and with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, in 27 (4 life threatening and 23 minor) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> was 91% (95% CI = 77% to 98%) at 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> was 99% (95% CI = 92% to 100%) at 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral valve regurgitation</z:hpo> (+3 to 4) and older age to be significant predictors of late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (P&lt; or =0.005), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, initial valve-preserving aortic root reconstruction, and need for a concomitant procedure at initial operation to be significant predictors of the need for reoperation (P&lt; or =0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aortic root replacement for aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> can be done with low morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Composite valve conduit reconstruction resulted in a durable result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were few serious complications related to the need for long-term anticoagulation or a prosthetic valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Reoperation was most commonly required because of failure of the aortic valve when a valve-preserving aortic root reconstruction was performed or for other cardiac or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> elsewhere </plain></SENT>
