<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genotyping is relevant for diagnosis and genotype-phenotype correlations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe the FBN1 genotypes and related phenotypes of 81 patients who were referred to our attention for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> or Marfan-like phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent multidisciplinary pertinent evaluation in the adult or paediatric setting, according to their age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis relied on Ghent criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To optimise DHPLC analysis of the FBN1 gene, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> coding regions of the gene were directly sequenced in 19 cases and 10 controls: heterozygous amplicons were used as true positives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DHPLC sensitivity was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Then, DHPLC was used to screen 62 other cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We identified 74 FBN1 mutations in 81 patients: 64 were novel and 17 known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 81 mutations, 41 were missense (50.6%), 27, either nonsense or frameshift mutations and predicted a premature termination codon (PTC) (33%), 11 affected splice sites (13.6%), and two predicted in-frame deletions (2.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most mutations (67.9%) occurred in cbEGF-like modules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Genotype was clinically relevant for early diagnosis and conclusion of the diagnostic work-up in patients with incomplete or atypical phenotypes </plain></SENT>
