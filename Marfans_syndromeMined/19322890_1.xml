<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have suggested that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852113" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital cardiovascular disorders</z:e> are the most common predisposing conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Trauma-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> is considered a rare occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System database of New York State was used to retrieve cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in persons &lt; or = 21 years old over a 10-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A retrospective analysis for risk or associated conditions was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-five of a total of 12,142 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (0.37%) occurred in persons &lt; or = 21 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patient was younger than 15 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six of the 45 died (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most patients were male (37 of 45, or 82%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Contrary to previous reports, the most common associated condition was trauma (19 of 45, or 42%), with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> the second most common (11 of 45, or 24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ten of 45 adolescent and young adult patients (22%) had no apparent risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Traumatic aortic disruptions must be considered in children and adolescents who survive serious chest trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Family members of pediatric and young adult patients with trauma-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> may need to be evaluated for possible risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
