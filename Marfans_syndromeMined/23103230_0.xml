<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using family-based exome sequencing, we identified a dominantly inherited heterozygous in-frame deletion in exon 1 of SKI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing of SKI further identified one overlapping heterozygous in-frame deletion and ten heterozygous missense mutations affecting recurrent residues in 18 of the 19 individuals screened for SGS; these individuals included one family affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001442'>somatic mosaicism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> mutations were located in a restricted area of exon 1, within the R-SMAD binding domain of SKI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No mutation was found in a cohort of 11 individuals with other marfanoid-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The interaction between SKI and Smad2/3 and Smad 4 regulates TGF-β signaling, and the pattern of anomalies in Ski-deficient mice corresponds to the clinical manifestations of SGS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings define SGS as a member of the family of diseases associated with the TGF-β-signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
