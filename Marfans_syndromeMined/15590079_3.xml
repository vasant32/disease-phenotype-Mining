<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A range of important pathologies affect the aorta and are responsible for a high level of morbidity and mortality in affected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many of these conditions are seen in the adult congenital population, especially as advances in diagnosis and treatment mean these patients are surviving well into adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As we gain a greater understanding of these disorders, especially the underlying genetics and pathophysiology, it becomes clear that the aorta is a highly complex part of the vascular tree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As such, the aorta requires increasingly sophisticated imaging techniques for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The advantages and disadvantages of the various imaging techniques available to clinicians will be discussed in the context of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> aortic pathology </plain></SENT>
