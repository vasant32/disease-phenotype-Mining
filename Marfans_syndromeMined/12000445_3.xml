<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of composite valve graft replacement in 193 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic valve disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta from January 1980 to June 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcome was compared between the patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (M group) and those without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (non-M group), between those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (AD group) and without dissection (non-AD group), between 2 different techniques for coronary artery reattachment (modified Bentall [mB] and modified Piehler [mP]), and between the time of operation (1980-1989 and 1990-1999) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Long-term outcome of this procedure was almost satisfactory with actuarial survival of 71.5 +/- 4.4% at 10 years and freedom from reoperation of 76.5 +/- 4.4% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Freedom from cardiovascular events and freedom from reoperation were significantly lower in the M group and AD group than in the non-M and non-AD groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, actuarial survival was significantly higher in the latter 10 years compared with the former 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that the improvement of perioperative management and proper selection of the technique for coronary artery reattachment could have improved the clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, there still remains a higher risk of cardiovascular event and future reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Extensive aortic reconstruction or staged operation should be performed in such patients </plain></SENT>
