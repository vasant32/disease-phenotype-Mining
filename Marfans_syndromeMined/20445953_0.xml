<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is used to measure arterial elasticity and stiffness and is related to the elastic properties of the vascular wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the practice of exercise is limited in MS patients, it was of interest to analyze the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> effect of submaximal exercise on aortic distensibility using PWV and other hemodynamic variables in patients with MS with either mild or no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PWV and physiological variables were evaluated before and after submaximal exercise in 33 patients with MS and 18 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PWV was 8.51 + or - 0.58 at rest and 9.10 + or - 0.63 m/s at the end of exercise (P = 0.002) in the group with MS and 8.07 + or - 0.35 and 8.98 + or - 0.56 m/s in the control group, respectively (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparative group analysis regarding PWV at rest and at the end of exercise revealed no statistically significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The same was true for the group that used beta-blockers and the one that did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The final heart rate was 10% higher in the control group than in the MS group (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Final systolic arterial pressure was higher in the control group (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PWV in MS patients with mild or no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> did not differ from the control group after submaximal effort </plain></SENT>
