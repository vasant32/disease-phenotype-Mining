<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little information is available concerning its usefulness for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From April 1992 to July 1998, we used the elephant trunk technique for treatment of aortic arch dissection in 22 patients (including 19 men) with a mean age of 58.5 years (range 21 to 85 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients presented with type A dissection (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> in 3 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> in 9), 3 with type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection, and 7 with "non A/non B" dissections with retrograde extension to the aortic arch or entry site located in the aortic arch without involvement of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the descending (n = 7) or thoracoabdominal (n = 15) aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Procedures were performed under hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> at between 15 degrees and 20 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antegrade cerebral perfusion was used in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The procedure was associated with aortic valve replacement and/or coronary bypass in 6 cases and bypass of one or more supraaortic vessels in 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In two patients the distal end of the elephant trunk was attached with an endovascular prosthesis during the same procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ensuing results in these patients indicate that the elephant trunk technique can be highly effective for treatment of complex aortic arch dissection </plain></SENT>
