<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To identify the genetic defect in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> (EL) family having 27 affected members in four generations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Detailed family history and clinical data were recorded for 48 family members including 24 persons with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Candidate gene regions at 5q and 15q known to be linked with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> were analyzed using fluorescent labeled microsatellite markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutation screening in the candidate gene, fibrillin-1 (FBN1), at 15q was performed by bidirectional sequencing of the amplified products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A maximum LOD score of 5.74 at theta=0.0 was obtained with marker D15S1024 in close proximity to FBN1 at 15q21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutation screening in FBN1 identified a C&gt;T transition at nucleotide position c.718 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This nucleotide change resulted in the substitution of highly conserved arginine by cysteine at codon 240 (R240C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This nucleotide substitution was not seen in any unaffected member of the family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We report a recurrent R240C mutation in FBN1 in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This mutation has previously been reported in a family with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo>, in another family with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> and involvement of the skeleton and integument, and in one person with classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is the largest family with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> reported to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results of the present study provide convincing evidence for a correlation of R240C and isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, this is the first report of molecular characterization in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> family of Indian origin </plain></SENT>
