<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>As commonly used, pleiotropy refers to multiple effects on phenotype of a single mutant gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The importance of this concept to medical genetics has waxed and waned since its formulation soon after the rediscovery of Mendel's laws </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initially, the view that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aspects of a phenotype, and hence <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> manifestations of a mendelian syndrome, derive from a single function (or dysfunction) of a mutant allele gained ascendancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Support for the importance of pleiotropy gradually diminished, and reached a low point in the 1940s with the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies of mammals and humans with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heritable disorders</z:e> of connective tissue sustained the notion that "genuine" pleiotropy probably did not exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the demise of the relevance of pleiotropy was premature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Detailed understanding of gene organization, expression, and mutation indicates several mechanisms, such as multifunctional proteins, alternative splicing of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi>, and overlapping coding sequences, through which genuine pleiotropy likely occurs in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development and function, in mendelian syndromes, and in conditions due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a broad definition of pleiotropy is warranted to subsume syndromes caused by abnormal function of contiguous genes, such as through large deletions, mutation of regulatory elements that coordinate expression, or less clearly understood "position effects." Thus, the use of pleiotropy in the context of <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> syndromes is not inappropriate </plain></SENT>
