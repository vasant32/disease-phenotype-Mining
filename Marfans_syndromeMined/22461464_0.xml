<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the Netherlands, evaluation for possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> is performed in specialized Marfan outpatient clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the diagnostic yield in our clinic and the impact of the 2010 nosology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> adult patients (n = 343) who visited our clinic between 1998 and 2008 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed their reasons for referral, characteristics, and established diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we applied the 2010 nosology to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and compared the outcomes to those obtained with the 1996 nosology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses that were made using the 1996 and the 2010 Ghent nosology included <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> (44/343 vs. 47/343), familial thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> and/or dissection (22/343 vs. 22/343 patients), Loeys-Dietz syndrome (4/343 vs. 4/343 patients), and (familial) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> (MVPS; 5/343 vs. 28/343 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both nosologies, 77% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients had an FBN1 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 2010 nosology led to an increase in the number of diagnoses made: 4 additional cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> were identified (one patient was "lost" who no longer fulfilled the criteria) and 23 additional cases of MVPS were diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic yield of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> was 65% using the 1996 nosology and 70% using the 2010 nosology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The change in diagnoses did not lead to a difference in clinical follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the diagnostic yield of our specialized clinic was high, in particular in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further more the 2010 Ghent nosology led to a significant increase in the number of diagnoses made, mainly due to lowering of the diagnostic threshold for MVPS </plain></SENT>
