<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To reduce mortality and morbidity of open repair, a multimodal approach has gradually evolved by maximizing organ protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: On a total of 1108 patients treated in our Center from 1993 for pathology involving the thoracic aorta, we reviewed the prospectively collected data of 194 consecutive patients who underwent open thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> repair, 104 (54%) for degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, 65 (34%) for dissections, 25 (12%) for other pattern of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Left Heart Bypass was used in 82% of cases, clamp and sew technique in 16%, hypotermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> in 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall perioperative mortality was 4.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of pulmonary complications was 8.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of cardiac complications, i.e. new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001700'>myocardial necrosis</z:hpo> demonstrated by positive blood tests, was 6.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of renal complications was 7.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo>, defined as a new neurologic deficit lasting more than 24 hours confirmed by imaging, occurred in 2.0% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752130" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord ischemia</z:e>, manifesting either as <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002385'>paraparesis</z:hpo>, was 4.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mortality and morbidity rates of open thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> repair are currently satisfactory especially in fit patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In order to define surgical indications and the role of endovascular repair, consideration of age of the patient, comorbidity, symptoms, life expectancy, likely quality of life (if asymptomatic), aortic diameter, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> extent, suitability of landing zones, and operator experience are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> distinctly relevant </plain></SENT>
