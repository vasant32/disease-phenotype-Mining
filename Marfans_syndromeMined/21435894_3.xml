<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospectively, we evaluated the results of aortic root replacement of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) who underwent surgery between January 1995 and January 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> was diagnosed using the Ghent criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AVS was used in 58 patients and CVG in 30 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AVS was done for aortic-root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (n=48) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> type A (n=10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CVG was used for aortic-root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in 14 patients or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> type A in 16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 3.2 (95% CI: 2.4-4.2) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both groups, 30-day mortality was 0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients (10.0%) in the CVG group required resternotomy for postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> versus two patients (3.4%) in the AVS group (p=0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, mortality was 10% in the CVG group versus 3.4% in the AVS group (p=0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Re-operation was required in two patients (3.4%) after AVS and in three patients after CVG (10%) (p=0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three patients (10.0%) who underwent CVG had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> and two patients (6.7%) had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during follow-up, whereas no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred after AVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After 14 years, stratified event-free survival was better in the AVS group (event-free survival was 82.3% vs 58.6%, log-rank test p=0.086), especially after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (p=0.057) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>After 10 years, freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> ≥II° in the AVS group was 80% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and 50% after dissection (p=0.524) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The reimplantation technique according to David was associated with excellent survival, good valve function and a low rate of re-operation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was a trend to better event-free survival for AVS patients making it the procedure of choice in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
