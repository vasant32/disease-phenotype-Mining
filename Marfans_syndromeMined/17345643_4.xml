<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of four novel FBN2 mutations were found in four probands (27%, 4/15), but remaining the 11 did not show any abnormality in either of the genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study indicated that FBN2 mutations were major abnormality in CCA, and TGFBR and FBN1 defects may not be responsible for the disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FBN2 mutations were only found at introns 30, 31, and 35 in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus analysis of a mutational hotspot from exons 22 to 36 (a middle part) of FBN2 should be prioritized in CCA as previously suggested </plain></SENT>
