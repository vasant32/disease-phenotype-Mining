<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: There were 183 thoracic deformity patients 110 idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, 32 adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, 28 <z:hpo ids='HP_0008453'>congenital kyphoscoliosis</z:hpo>, 8 Marfan syndrome with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, and 6 others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients' Cobb angles were evaluated preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively by roentgenograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The deformity correction rate was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> radiographic evaluations were carried out in a double-blind fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The complication rate was analyzed perioperatively and postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The deformity correction rate was 72%, better than others treated with hook-rod system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The perioperation complication rate was 8.4% (pedicle fracture 1.5%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> 3.8%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo> and plural effusion 1.6%, transitory neurological damage 0.5%, and over-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> shock 1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The complication rate at follow-up was 3.6% (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> 0.5%, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> fracture 1%, loss of deformity correction 1.6%, and transitory neurological damage 0.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with those treated with hook-rod system, the perioperation complication rate, loss of deformity correction, permanent damage, and complications related to the internal fixation were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The complication rate of pedicle screw fixation system was low in the treatment of thoracic deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When surgeons are thoroughly familiar with the technique and related pathoanatomy, and with the spinal cord function wardship by SEP, complications related to the pedicle screw technique in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002943'>thoracic scoliosis</z:hpo> will be well controlled </plain></SENT>
