<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To examine problems in echocardiographic diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, multiple crystal cross-sectional echocardiography and single crystal recordings derived from the multiple crystal array were used to study 45 clinically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children aged 3 to 15 years (Group A), 26 children aged 2 to 10 years with known <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> (Group B), 12 children with a catheterization-proved large left to right shunt at the ventricular level (Group C) and 8 children with catheterization-proved left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (Group D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Children in Groups A and B were not studied hemodynamically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Children in Groups C and D had no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> on angiography and were studied echocardiographically to determine the effect of changes in ventricular shape on the patterns of mitral valve motion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the real time cross-sectional studies, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patients demonstrated a spectrum of mitral valve motion in which the bodies of the anterior and posterior leaflets became slightly horizontal with systolic ejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mitral apparatus assumed a curvilinear funnel shape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arching of the leaflets into a horizontal configuration was more striking in the presence of either left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> in left to right shunt or involvement of the anterior mitral anulus in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001682'>subaortic stenosis</z:hpo> (two patients) and was associated with false positive M mode tracings suggesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This latter configuration was easily differentiated from the superior motion of the body of the leaflets in true <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Studies of single crystal M mode recordings derived form the cross-sectional array in known locations from six <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patients revealed M mode patterns of pseudoprolapse in tracings derived from the leaflet body and patterns of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> motion at the free edge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, superior-posterior <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> visualized in cross-sectional studies in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026267" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PMV">click-murmur syndrome</z:e> was associated with abnormal M mode recordings from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parts of the leaflet, including the free edge, although the abnormalities were most striking in tracings derived from the leaflet body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The M mode echocardiographic findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patients and patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026267" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PMV">click-murmur syndrome</z:e> were dependent upon transducer angulation and the portion of the valve examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The critical differentiation of the spectrum of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> valve motion from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> requires careful evaluation of echoes from the free edge of the leaflet where the posterior and anterior leaflet echoes coapt in early systole </plain></SENT>
