<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To examine whether augmentation index (AIx) is increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) and associated with increased aortic root size, and whether a peripheral-to-central generalised transfer function (GTF) can be applied usefully in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 10 MFS patients and 10 healthy controls (matched for sex, age and height) were studied before and after 400 microg sub-lingual GTN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arterial waveforms were recorded using applanation tonometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIx and pulse pressure (PP) were determined for the radial and carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured between carotid and femoral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GTFs were generated to examine the relationship between radial and carotid waveforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AIx was greater in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> compared to controls at radial (mean -31.4 (SD 14.3)% v -50.2(15.6)%, p = 0.003) and carotid (-7.6(11.2)% v -23.7(12.7)%, p = 0.004) sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Baseline PP at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measurement sites, and PWV, did not differ between subject groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis demonstrated that PWV and carotid AIx were positively correlated with aortic root size (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.012 respectively), independent of the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PP was not associated with aortic root size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>GTN caused similar decreases in AIx in both controls and patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were found in GTFs between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and control subjects, which changed following GTN administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, when an independent GTF was used to derive carotid waves from radial waves, no differences were found in the degree of error between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: AIx is sensitive to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> present in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, and may have a role as an adjunct to measurement of central PP and PWV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Differences between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and controls in the nature of the peripheral-to-central GTF are present, although have little effect on the pulse contour </plain></SENT>
