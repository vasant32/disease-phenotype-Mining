<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent standard anteroposterior radiographs of the lumbar spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interpediculate distances (IPD) at each level were compared to those of previously established norms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Criteria were developed to determine the presence of Marfan using "cut-off values" for the IPDs at each lumbar level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The IPDs were significantly larger in the Marfan patients at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lumbar levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cut-off values were calculated setting the specificity at 95% at each lumbar level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cut-off value at L4 yielded the greatest sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the IPDs are widened in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The IPD at L4 is a good criterion for Marfan with specificity of 95% and sensitivity of 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One must consider using this as a skeletal criterion or a screening tool for Marfan </plain></SENT>
