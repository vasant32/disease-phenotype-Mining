<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-two necropsy cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> aortic syndrome were encountered during the last six years--41 dissections and one penetrating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>; the intramural haematoma was not seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to the DeBakey classification, there were 26 dissections of type I, 8 of type II, 1 of type IIIA, and 4 of type IIIB; in 2 cases the dissection was confined to the abdominal aorta </plain></SENT>
