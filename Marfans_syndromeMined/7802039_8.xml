<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No patient had clinical or echocardiographic evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, although there was a trend towards relatively longer measurements of height; lower segment; arm span; middle finger, hand, and foot length in the affected members of the family, compared with unaffected sibs of the same sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of linkage to intragenic FBN1 markers was inconclusive because they were relatively uniformative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Construction of a multipoint background map from the CEPH reference families identified microsatellite markers linked closely to FBN1 which could demonstrate linkage of EL in this family to the FBN1 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LINKMAP analysis detected a multipoint lod score of 5.68 at D15S119, a marker approximately 6 cM distal to FBN1, and a multipoint lod score of 5.04 at FBN1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The EL gene in this family is likely to be allelic to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and molecular characterization of the FBN1 mutation should now be possible </plain></SENT>
