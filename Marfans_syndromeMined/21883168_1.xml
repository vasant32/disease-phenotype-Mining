<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three diagnostic classifications comprising first, Marfan genotype with a causative FBN1 gene mutation; second, Marfan phenotype with clinical criteria of the original Ghent nosology (Ghent-1); and third, phenotype with clinical criteria of its current revision (Ghent-2) in 300 consecutive persons referred for confirmation or exclusion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (150 men, 150 women aged 35 Â± 13 years) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of TGBR1/2 genes was performed in 128 persons without FBN1 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Marfan genotype was present in 140, Ghent-1 phenotype in 139, and Ghent-2 phenotype in 124 of 300 study patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> was confirmed in 94 and excluded in 129 persons consistently by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> classifications, but classifications were discordant in 77 persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With combined genotype and phenotype information confirmation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> was finally achieved in 126 persons by Ghent-1 and in 125 persons by Ghent-2 among 140 persons with Marfan genotype, and exclusion was accomplished in 139 persons by Ghent-1 and in 141 persons by Ghent-2 among 160 persons without Marfan genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In total, genotype information changed final diagnoses in 22 persons with Ghent-1, and in 32 persons with Ghent-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that genotype information is essential for diagnosis or exclusion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
