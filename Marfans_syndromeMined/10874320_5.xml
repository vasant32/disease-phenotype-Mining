<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMD</z:e> is a fully homogeneous, rapid four step procedure that allows for detection and localization of mismatched or unmatched <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> within heteroduplex DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test the utility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMD</z:e> for use in the screening of large and complex genes, the fibrillin 1 (FBN1) gene was scanned in a cohort of six patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four of the six patients were diagnosed with classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with a previous MDEtrade mark scanning of the same patient cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two causative mutations, R565X and R1523X, were detected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMD</z:e> that were not detected by MDE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both cases, the mutation resulted in premature termination of translation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, several polymorphisms were detected by the enzymatic approach that failed detection by heteroduplex analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMD</z:e> method is a sensitive and rapid approach to mutation detection in large genes such as FBN1 </plain></SENT>
