<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alkali hydrolysates of elastins contained a radioactive peak that was eluted between proline and leucine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This peak was not present in foetal elastin, but its proportion increased steadily during aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aortic samples from patients with annulo-aortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta), including one with classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, contained less elastin (CNBr-insoluble material) than did the age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of radioactivity in the new peak of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these aortas was low when compared with age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gas-chromatographic/mass-spectrometric analysis suggested that it contained a cyclic derivative of a hydrated aldol-condensation product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The concentration of the cross-link precursors, lysine <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17478">aldehyde</z:chebi> and aldol-condensation product (estimated from the acid-hydrolysis product 6-chloronorleucine and the acid-degradation product of reduced aldol-condensation product) was high in very young aortas but remained quite stable after childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed in cross-link profiles of acid hydrolysates between pathological and control aortas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A low proportion of radioactivity in the new peak may indicate the presence of young or immature elastin in the pathological aortas </plain></SENT>
