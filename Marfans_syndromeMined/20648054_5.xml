<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although mutations in FBN1 and TGFBR1/TGFBR2 account for the majority of AD cases referred to us for molecular genetic testing, we have obtained negative results for these genes in a large cohort of AD patients, suggesting the involvement of additional genes or acquired factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we assessed the effect of COL3A1 deletions/duplications in this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis of 100 unrelated patients identified one hemizygous deletion of the entire COL3A1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequent microarray analyses and sequencing of breakpoints revealed the deletion size of 3,408,306 bp at 2q32.1q32.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This deletion affects not only COL3A1 but also 21 other known genes (GULP1, DIRC1, COL5A2, WDR75, SLC40A1, ASNSD1, ANKAR, OSGEPL1, ORMDL1, LOC100129592, PMS1, MSTN, C2orf88, HIBCH, INPP1, MFSD6, TMEM194B, NAB1, GLS, STAT1, and STAT4), mutations in three of which (COL5A2, SLC40A1, and MSTN) have also been associated with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> disorder (EDS classical type, <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp> type 4, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003712'>muscle hypertrophy</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Physical and laboratory examinations revealed that true haploinsufficiency of COL3A1, COL5A2, and MSTN, but not that of SLC40A1, leads to a clinical phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data not only emphasize the impact/role of COL3A1 in AD patients but also extend the molecular etiology of several disorders by providing hitherto unreported evidence for true haploinsufficiency of the underlying gene </plain></SENT>
