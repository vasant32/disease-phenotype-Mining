<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One patient had annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath>, one had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011645'>sinus of valsalva aneurysm</z:hpo>, 13 patients had a Debakey type I <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection, 10 had a Debakey type II <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection including two Marfan patients, and 14 had atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>6 patients (15%) died within a postoperative period of 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up time was 40 months (1-82 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients were restudied by clinical examinations and computed tomography of the chest (CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients required emergency reoperation due to disruption of the proximal aortic anastomosis and right coronary anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both patients had been diagnosed to have Marfan disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anastomotic dehiscence of composite grafts has a potentially high risk of lethal complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In follow-up examination computed tomography was performed as a simple and accurate method to detect complications such as pseudoaneurysms, but up to now did not give the indications for reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suggest that complications may occur not only in the early postoperative period so that regular CT-scan control studies (every 6 to 12 months) should be performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who undergo composite graft replacement </plain></SENT>
