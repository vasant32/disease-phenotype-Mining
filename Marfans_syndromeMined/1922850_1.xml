<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the present time, to avoid the high incidence of recurrence due to the aged and weakened tissue component of the groin area, we reinforce the posterior wall of the inguinal canal with Mersilene (dacron) mesh </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most surgeons agree to use a prosthetic mesh in recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000023'>inguinal hernia</z:hpo> repairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, sometimes it is necessary to use mesh in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> like Ehlers <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">syndrome, Marfan</z:e> syndrome, and acquired absence of the posterior wall fascia transversalis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Currently, <z:chebi fb="80" ids="53550">polypropylene</z:chebi> and dacron mesh are the most satisfactory, since they are readily available and become well incorporated by connective tissue </plain></SENT>
