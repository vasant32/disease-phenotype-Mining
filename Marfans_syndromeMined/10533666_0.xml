<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>But this procedure may sacrifice an anatomically salvageable aortic valve and requires a life-long anticoagulation with its attendant thromboembolic versus haemorrhagic risks, which is not ideal for young active patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, two techniques of aortic root replacement with aortic valve sparing have been described, based on experimental data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first one is Yacoub's procedure (1983), where the correction of the aortic root is performed by correcting the sinotubular junction and replacement of the aortic sinuses with an appropriately tailored Dacron graft (remodelling) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second technique was described by David (1992) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this one, the aortic root reconstruction is performed by reimplanting the aortic valve in a tubular Dacron graft (reimplantation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since 1993, we have been interested in these procedures and the aim of this study was to examine the perioperative and intermediate term results of these techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From 1993 to 1998, 14 patients had either reimplantation of the aortic valve (3 patients) or remodelling of the aortic root (11 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients' ages ranged from 17 to 57 years (40.2 +/- 7.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were 11 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo>, three 1+ (21.4%), 3+ (21.4%), seven 2+ (50%) and one 3+ (7.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients had morphologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aortic leaflets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean diameter of the sinuses was 57 +/- 4 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The left ventricular function was measured as the percentage of the fractional shortening of the left ventricular diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The mean of the fractional shortening was 38.3 +/- 4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There was no mortality and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients underwent early and late follow-up echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The 14 patients have only mild or no insufficiency, which has not progressed in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>No other valve-related complication has occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Aortic valve-sparing replacement of the aortic root is an excellent procedure for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> and anatomically salvageable valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The long-term results are still unknown but it seems an attractive alternative to composite replacement of the aortic valve and descending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Morbidity and mortality rates are very low, even lower than a Bentall procedure, while the savings in cost and human lives due to the absence of a mechanical valve prosthesis are significant </plain></SENT>
