<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (IMH) was recently identified at necropsy and anecdotally in vivo as a unique aortic syndrome (without entry and with no flap-like intraluminal component, such as overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about diagnosis, prognosis, and outcome of IMH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 1983 and 1993, 360 patients from two medical centers with clinical indications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> were prospectively evaluated; they presented to the emergency department a median of 3.5 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of back or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> or other suggestive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 195 patients with aortic syndromes, 25 patients (12.8%) were diagnosed to have IMH of the thoracic aorta with no evidence of a primary intimal tear, flap, or overt dissection by multiple noninvasive imaging modalities, including magnetic resonance imaging (n = 12), contrast-enhanced computed tomography (n = 14), and transesophageal echocardiography (n = 3) in random order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 16 men and 9 women with a median age of 56 +/- 13 years (range, 15 to 80 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was present in the majority (84%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> was present in 3 patients (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IMH was diagnosed within 4 days of hospital admission (median, 2.5 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IMH involved the ascending aorta (type A) in 12 cases (48%), the aortic arch in 2 (8%), and the descending aorta (type B) in 11 cases (44%); imaging results were validated by crossmatching with intraoperative, pathomorphological, and/or angiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IMH was 8.5 +/- 5 cm in length and 2.0 +/- 1.2 cm in aortic wall thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>Aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> and pericardial and mediastinal effusion were present in 5 of 12 patients (42%) with type A IMH and 2 of 11 patients (18%) with type B IMH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IMH progression to overt dissection, rupture, and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> tamponade occurred in 8 of 25 patients (32%) within 24 to 72 hours, indicating the need for urgent intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 30-day mortality rate of IMH afflicting the ascending aorta was 80% (4 of 5 cases) with medical treatment (sedation and blood pressure control) versus no mortality in 7 cases with early surgical repair (P &lt; .01); after 1 year, 71.4% of surgically treated patients were alive versus 20% in the medical group (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>IMH of the aortic arch resulted in an early mortality of 50% (1 of 2 patients) with medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In IMH confined to the descending thoracic aorta, survival with medical treatment was not different from surgical therapy; there was 1 early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> among 6 patients with medical therapy and none out of 5 patients with surgery (P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At 1-year follow-up, medical and surgical therapy groups had survival rates of 80% and 83%, respectively (P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IMH is associated with a clinical profile and prognosis similar to classic dissection and may be considered an ominous precursor of overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Tomographic noninvasive imaging ensures rapid, nontraumatic diagnosis of IMH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The outcome of IMH of the ascending aorta appears favorable only with immediate surgical repair </plain></SENT>
