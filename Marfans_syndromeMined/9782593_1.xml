<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study analyzes the role of aortic valve replacement for the evolution of late dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a series of 80 consecutive patients with type A dissection, a previous aortic valve replacement had been performed in 12 cases (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.001) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (p &lt; 0.01), multivariate analysis identified previous aortic valve replacement (p &lt; 0.01) as an independent predisposing factor for type A dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dissection occurred 3 +/- 4 years after aortic valve replacement with a clinical and anatomical profile similar to classic dissection as proven by comparison to a group of 62 patients with classic dissection associated with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With 75% and 66%, respectively, 30 day and 1 year survival of patients with dissection following later after aortic valve replacement was similar to patients with classic type A dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Extensive thinning and/or fragility (p &lt; 0.05) of the aortic wall in the presence of a mildly dilated aorta (45 +/- 5 mm) at the time of aortic valve replacement was associated with a high risk for late dissection; this finding was substantiated by comparison to a control group of 10 consecutive patients with a similarly <z:mp ids='MP_0011575'>dilated aortic root</z:mp> but no dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Type and diameter of valve prostheses, cross-clamp time, NYHA functional class, and left ventricular ejection fraction were unrelated to late dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Previous aortic valve replacement is an independent predisposing factor for a dissection of the ascending aorta later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the time of aortic valve replacement, prophylactic replacement or wrapping of the ascending aorta should be considered in patients with a thinned/fragile aortic wall even without a markedly <z:mp ids='MP_0011575'>dilated aortic root</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
