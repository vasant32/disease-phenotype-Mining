<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred twenty consecutive patients who had aortic valve sparing for aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> were prospectively studied with annual clinical assessments and echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their mean age was 46 +/- 15 years, 40% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, 17% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, and 7% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reimplantation of the aortic valve was performed in 167 patients and remodeling of the aortic root in 53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aortic cusp repair was performed in 80 patients, and reinforcement of the free margin of one of the cusps with a fine <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> (Gore-Tex) suture in 48 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 5.2 +/- 3.7 years and it was complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 3 operative and 13 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients' survival at 10 years was 88% +/- 3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age older than 65 years, advanced functional class, and ejection fraction less than 40% were independent predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> developed in 7 patients and severe insufficiency in 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Freedom from moderate or severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> at 10 years was 85% +/- 5% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, but it was 94% +/- 4% after reimplantation and 75% +/- 10% after remodeling (P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five patients required aortic valve replacement; the freedom from valve replacement at 10 years was 95% +/- 3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> developed 11 years postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At the latest follow-up, 88% of the patients were in functional class I, and 10% were in class II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aortic valve-sparing operation is associated with low rates of valve-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The probability of late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> was lower after the reimplantation procedure than after remodeling in our experience </plain></SENT>
