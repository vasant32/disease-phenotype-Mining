<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human fibrillin-1, an extracellular matrix <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>, has a modular organization that includes 43 calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like (cbEGF) domains arranged as multiple tandem repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A missense mutation that changes a highly conserved glycine to serine (G1127S) has been identified in cbEGF13, which results in a variant of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous experiments on isolated cbEGF13 and a cbEGF13-14 pair indicated that the G1127S mutation caused defective folding of cbEGF13 but not cbEGF14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have used limited proteolysis methods and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy to identify the structural consequences of this mutation in a covalently linked cbEGF12-13 pair and a cbEGF12-14 triple domain construct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Protease digestion studies of the cbEGF12-13 G1127S mutant pair indicated that both cbEGF12 and 13 retained similar calcium binding properties and thus tertiary structure to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> domain pair, because <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> identified cleavage sites showed calcium-dependent protection from proteolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, small changes in the conformation of cbEGF13 G1127S, revealed by the presence of a new protease-sensitive site and comparative two-dimensional NOESY data, suggested that the fold of the mutant domain was not identical to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>, but was native-like </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional cleavage sites identified in cbEGF12-14 G1127S indicated further subtle changes within the mutant domain but not the flanking domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have concluded the following in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(i) Covalent linkage of cbEGF12 preserves the native-like fold of cbEGF13 G1127S and (ii) conformational effects introduced by G1127S are localized to cbEGF13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that missense mutations in fibrillin-1 cbEGF domains can cause short range structural effects in addition to long range effects previously observed with a E1073K mutation in cbEGF12 </plain></SENT>
