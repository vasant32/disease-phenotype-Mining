<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We present our experience of total aortic arch replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-nine patients (21 males and 8 females; mean age 63.3 ± 13.3 years) with extended thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> underwent graft replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathology of the diseased aorta was non-dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in 11 patients, including one <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in 18 patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A: one, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type A: 11, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type B: six) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In their previous operation, two patients had undergone the Bentall procedure, three had endovascular stenting, one had aortic root replacement with valve sparing and 12 had hemi-arch replacement for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Approaches to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> were as follows: posterolateral thoracotomy with rib-cross incision in 16, posterolateral thoracotomy extended to the retroperitoneal abdominal aorta in seven, mid-sternotomy and left pleurotomy in three, anterolateral thoracotomy with partial lower sternotomy in two and clam-shell incision in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Extension of aortic replacement was performed from the aortic root to the descending aorta in 4, from the ascending aorta to the descending aorta in 17 and from the ascending to the abdominal aorta in eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Arterial inflow for cardiopulmonary bypass consisted of the femoral artery in 15 patients, ascending aorta and femoral artery in seven, descending or abdominal aorta in five and ascending aorta in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Venous drainage site was the femoral vein in 10, pulmonary artery in eight, right atrium in five, femoral artery with right atrium/pulmonary artery in four and pulmonary artery with right atrium in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The operative mortality, 30-day mortality and hospital mortality was one (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture), one (rupture of infected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>) and one (brain <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp>), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Late mortality occurred in three patients due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, ruptured residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival at 5 years after the operations was 80.6 ± 9.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Freedom from the subsequent aortic events was 96.0 ± 3.9% at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our treatment method for extensive thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> achieved satisfactory results using specific strategies and appropriate organ protection according to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> extension in the selected patients </plain></SENT>
