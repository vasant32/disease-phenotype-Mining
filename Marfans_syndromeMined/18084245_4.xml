<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the basic mechanism is unknown, there is a consensus that malfunctioning of the extracellular matrix is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002097'>emphysema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed the expression of the elastic fiber protein fibrillin-1 in a large number (n=69) of human lung specimens with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002097'>emphysema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specimens were morphologically characterized by the Destructive Index, the Mean Linear Intercept, and the Panel Grading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed a strong correlation (P&lt;0.001) of aberrant fibrillin-1 staining with the degree of destruction of lung parenchyma (r=0.71), airspace enlargement (r=0.47), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002097'>emphysema</z:hpo>-related morphological abnormalities (r=0.69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no obvious correlations with age and smoking behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Staining for three other extracellular matrix components (type I collagen, type IV collagen, and laminin) was not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The aberrant fibrillin-1 staining observed in this study is similar to that observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, a syndrome caused by mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002097'>emphysema</z:hpo> is noticed in a number of Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This, together with the notion that disruption of the fibrillin-1 gene in mice results in emphysematous lesions, makes fibrillin-1 a strong candidate to be involved in the etiology and pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002097'>emphysema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
