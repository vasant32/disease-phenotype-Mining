<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin proteins are the major components of extracellular microfibrils found in many connective tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 are well studied and mutations in these proteins cause a number of fibrillinopathies including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and congenital contractural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin-3 was more recently discovered and is much less well characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin-1 is expressed throughout life, whereas fibrillins-2 and -3 are thought to be primarily present during development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we report detailed fibrillin-3 expression patterns in early human development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A polyclonal antiserum against a C-terminal recombinant half of human fibrillin-3 was produced in rabbit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-fibrillin-3 antibodies were affinity-purified and antibodies cross-reacting with the other fibrillins were removed by absorption resulting in specific anti-fibrillin-3 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analyses with these purified antibodies demonstrate that fibrillin-3 is temporally expressed in numerous tissues relatively evenly from the 6th to the 12th gestational week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin-3 was found spatially expressed in perichondrium, perineurium, perimysium, skin, developing bronchi, glomeruli, pancreas, kidney, heart and testis and at the prospective basement membranes in developing epithelia and endothelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Double immunohistochemical analyses showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fibrillins are globally expressed in the same organs, with a number of differences on the tissue level in cartilage, perichondrium and developing bronchi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that fibrillin-3, compared to the other fibrillins, fulfills both overlapping and distinct functions in human development </plain></SENT>
