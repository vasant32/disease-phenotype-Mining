<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Stent graft-induced new entry (SINE), defined as the new tear caused by the stent graft and excluding those arising from natural disease progression or iatrogenic injury from the endovascular manipulation, has been increasingly observed after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for Stanford type B dissection in our center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SINE appears to be remarkably life threatening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the incidence, mortality, causes, and preventions of SINE after TEVAR for Stanford type B dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data for 22 patients with SINE were retrospectively collected and analyzed from 650 patients undergoing TEVAR for type B dissection from August 2000 to June 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An additional patient was referred to our center 14 months after TEVAR was performed in another hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The potential associations of SINE with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, location of SINE and endograft placement, and the oversizing rate were analyzed by Fisher exact probability test or t test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found 24 SINE tears in 23 patients, including SINE at the proximal end of the endograft in 15, at the distal end in 7, and at both ends in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SINE incidence and mortality reached 3.4% and 26.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two SINE patients were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, whereas there were only 6 Marfan patients among the 651 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 16 proximal SINEs were evidenced at the greater curve of the arch and caused retrograde type A dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The eight distal SINEs occurred at the dissected flap, and five caused enlarging <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> whereas three remained stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The endograft was placed across the distal aortic arch during the primary TEVAR in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 23 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The incidence of SINE was 33.33% among Marfan patients vs 3.26% among non-Marfan patients (P = .016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in mortality between proximal and distal SINE (25% vs 28.6%, P &gt; .99), incidence of SINE between endograft placement across the arch and at the straight portion of descending thoracic aorta (23 of 613 vs 0 of 38, P = .39), and the oversizing rate between SINE and non-SINE patients (13% ± 4.5% vs 16% ± 6.5%, P = .98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SINE appears not to be rare after TEVAR for type B dissection and is associated with substantial mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The stress yielded by the endograft seems to play a predominant role in its occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It is important to take this stress-induced injury into account during both design and placement of the endograft </plain></SENT>
