<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The biomechanical consequences of aging and genetic mutation in mitral valves are poorly understood because of limited tools to study this in mouse models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine the global biomechanical and local cell-matrix deformation relationships in the aging and Marfan related Fbn1 mutated murine mitral valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To conduct this investigation, a novel stretching apparatus and gripping method was implemented to directly quantify both global tissue biomechanics and local cellular deformation and matrix fiber realignment in murine mitral valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Excised mitral valve leaflets from <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and Fbn1 mutant mice from 2 weeks to 10 months in age were tested in circumferential orientation under continuous laser optical imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mouse mitral valves stiffen with age, correlating with increases in collagen fraction and matrix fiber alignment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fbn1 mutation resulted in significantly more compliant valves (modulus 1.34 ± 0.12 vs. 2.51 ± 0.31 MPa, respectively, P&lt;.01) at 4 months, corresponding with an increase in proportion of GAGs and decrease in elastin fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Local cellular deformation and fiber alignment change linearly with global tissue stretch, and these slopes become more extreme with aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In comparison, Fbn1 mutated valves have decoupled cellular deformation and fiber alignment with tissue stretch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, quantitative understanding of multi-scale murine planar tissue biomechanics is essential for establishing consequences of aging and genetic mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Decoupling of local cell-matrix deformation kinematics with global tissue stretch may be an important mechanism of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathological biomechanical remodeling in valves </plain></SENT>
