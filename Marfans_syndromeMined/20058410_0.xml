<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Frequently occurring <z:hpo ids='HP_0003419'>low back pain</z:hpo> was reported by 19% of the patients, but the disability was slight in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Flexion and extension mobility of the lumbar spine (L1-S1) assessed from radiographs was 59.9 degrees and 13.2 degrees, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean lumbar angular mobility between flexion and extension radiographs was 7.4 degrees at L1-2, 13.2 degrees at L2-3, 16.0 degrees at L3-4, 19.3 degrees at L4-5 and 18.3 degrees at L5-S1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between the manual assessment of lumbar segmental instability and radiological translatory motion, except at L2-3, where the correlation was negative (r = -0.41, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003419'>low back pain</z:hpo> does not seem to differ substantially between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> patients and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population, and it seems that there is at most a slight hypermobility of the lumbar spine in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several validity problems are encountered in the manual assessment of lumbar instability </plain></SENT>
