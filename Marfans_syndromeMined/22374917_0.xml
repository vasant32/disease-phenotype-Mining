<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003811'>neonatal death</z:hpo> from aortic complications of mice lacking fibrillin-1 (Fbn1(-/-) mice) has limited the scope of these studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the creation of a conditional mutant allele (Fbn1(fneo) ) that contains loxP sites bordering exon1 of Fbn1 and an frt-flanked neo expression cassette downstream of it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fbn1(fneo/+) mice were crossed with FLPeR mice and the resulting Fbn1(Lox/+) progeny were crossed with Fbn1(+/-) ;CMV-Cre mice to generate Fbn1(CMV-/-) mice, which were found to phenocopy the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> of Fbn1(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, mating Fbn1(Lox/+) mice with Prx1-Cre or Osx-Cre mice revealed an unappreciated role of fibrillin-1 microfibrils in restricting osteoprogenitor cell recruitment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fbn1(Lox/+) mice are, therefore, an informative genetic resource to further dissect <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> pathogenesis and the role of extracellular fibrillin-1 assemblies in organ development and homeostasis </plain></SENT>
