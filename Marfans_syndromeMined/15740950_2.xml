<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A consecutive series of 34 children (mean age 10.8+/-5.4 years) who underwent elective aortic root replacement using composite graft or homograft from 1987 to 2003 (mean follow-up 5.7+/-3.7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Preoperatively, the aortic annulus and aortic root average z-scores were 4.1+/-2.2 and 9.4+/-4.7, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Composite graft root replacement was performed in 22 patients, and cryopreserved aortic homograft root replacement in 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was one perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the homograft group due to sudden cardiovascular collapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was one late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the composite graft group due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, and two late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the homograft root replacement group, one at 7 months postoperatively due to coronary artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and one due to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myocardial dysfunction 5 years postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient who initially had a homograft died due to mechanical valve <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> following reoperative composite graft replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients had reoperations at a median of 7.1 years after initial surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient in the composite graft group underwent arch replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no graft related reoperations after composite graft root replacement, but 4 patients in the homograft group had reoperative composite graft replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Predictors of reoperation included age at surgery, lower weight, and longer ICU time (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In children with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, reoperation is more common after homograft root replacement than composite graft replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Composite graft root replacement provides more stable repair of the aortic root </plain></SENT>
