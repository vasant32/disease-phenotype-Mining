<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> (AR) severe enough to warrant aortic valve replacement (AVR) have received little attention in the last 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed the causes of pure AR in 268 patients &gt; 20 years of age having isolated AVR at Baylor University Medical Center from 1993 to 2005 that was unassociated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo>, mitral valve replacement, or a previous operation involving a cardiac valve or ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 122 patients (46%), the AR resulted from a problem with the aortic valve: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformation</z:e> unassociated with infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, 66 patients (54%); infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, 46 patients (38%; 15 with bicuspid valves); probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="rhd">rheumatic heart disease</z:e>, 8 patients (6%); and miscellaneous, 2 patients (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the other 146 patients (54%), the AR was the consequence of a condition affecting the ascending aorta: dissection, 28 patients (19%); the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> or its forme fruste variety, 15 patients (10%); <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp>, 12 patients (8%), and in the remaining 91 patients (62%), the cause of the AR was not determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This latter group was the oldest (mean age 66 years), 83 (91%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, 26 (29%) had small calcific deposits in the valve cusps, and 46 (51%) had simultaneous coronary artery bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The causes of pure AR severe enough to warrant isolated AVR are diverse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common category in this study was "cause unclear." </plain></SENT>
