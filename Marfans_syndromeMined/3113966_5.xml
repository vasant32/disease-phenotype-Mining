<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cellular synthesis of collagen and non-collagenous proteins was significantly increased, whereas secretion and degradation remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other steps of post-translational processing such as hydroxylation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26274,32874">prolyl</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32568">lysyl</z:chebi> residues, affecting triple helix stability, were found to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hence, our study would support the notion that defects other than those affecting collagen type I or III metabolism must represent the molecular basis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
