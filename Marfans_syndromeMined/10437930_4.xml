<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the single leg stance footprint of 40 feet in 21 people with no history of foot problems, using pressure-sensitive film and a Harris mat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The medial and lateral aspects of the forefoot, midfoot, and hindfoot were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The midfoot was further analyzed by dividing the medial midfoot force by the total midfoot force </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean medial midfoot force/total midfoot force was 11.1% (SD = 6.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001763'>Pes planus</z:hpo> was defined as the medial midfoot force/total midfoot force &gt; 24.0% (mean + 2 SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A population associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001763'>pes planus</z:hpo> (124 feet in 63 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>) was then evaluated in the same fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the mean medial midfoot force/total midfoot force was not statistically different (16.0%), a distinct group of patients (25%) had forces that were outside the range of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> midfoot forces </plain></SENT>
