<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We undertook a prospective evaluation of the outcomes of pregnancy, both maternal and fetal, and the long-term impact of pregnancy on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in a series of consecutive, unselected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Forty-five pregnancies in 21 Marfan syndrome patients were prospectively observed in one institution between 1983 and 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During pregnancy, patients were monitored with serial echocardiograms and close attention to symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Maternal and fetal outcomes were monitored with serial echocardiographic data were analyzed by least-squares regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighteen of the patients were followed up for 15 months to 13 years after the completion of their last pregnancy for investigation of the long-term impact of pregnancy on the cardiovascular manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic dissection</z:hpo> occurred in two patients, both with increased risk for dissection established before pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of obstetric complications otherwise did not exceed that in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic data demonstrated little to no change in aortic root diameter throughout pregnancy in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up showed no apparent worsening of cardiovascular status attributable to pregnancy in comparison with a group of 18 women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who were of similar age, had a similar degree of disease severity, and underwent no pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in whom cardiovascular involvement is minor and aortic root diameter is &lt; 40 mm usually tolerate pregnancy well, with favorable maternal and fetal outcomes, and without subsequent evidence of aggravated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> over time </plain></SENT>
