<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The major diseases affecting the aorta are <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and dissections, which are classified based on anatomic location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diseases affecting the ascending aorta, such as thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and type I and II dissections, are primarily associated with medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> on pathologic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> is characterized by fragmentation and loss of elastic fibers, loss of smooth muscle cells, and interstitial collections of collagenous tissue and basophilic ground substance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> occurs as part of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aging of the aorta but is accelerated by other conditions, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and genetic alterations that predispose persons to these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The etiologies of many of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0567439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic syndromes</z:e>, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, that predispose persons to thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and dissections are understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Studies are just beginning to elucidate the genes that predispose persons without known syndromes to these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic diseases</z:e>, and a major locus for this condition, termed the TAAD1 locus, has been mapped to 5q13-14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Future characterization of this gene and others will enhance the ability to determine persons at risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and dissections and will define molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of this disorder </plain></SENT>
