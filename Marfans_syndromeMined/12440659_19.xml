<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Aortic valve-sparing operations are an alternative to aortic root replacement in patients with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, or aortic valve replacement and supracoronary replacement of the ascending aorta in patients with ascending aorta <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0011574'>dilated sinotubular junctions</z:mp> with consequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1988 to 2001, 230 patients underwent aortic valve-sparing operations for aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (151 patients) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> (79 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two types of aortic valve-sparing operations were performed in patients with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>: reimplantation of the aortic valve and remodeling of the aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 3.8 +/- 2.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were younger, had less severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo>, less extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, and better left ventricular function than patients with ascending aorta <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 8-year survival was 83% +/- 5% for the first group and 36% +/- 14% for the second </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The freedom from aortic valve reoperation at 8 years was 99% +/- 1% for the first group and 97% +/- 2% for the second </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients who had aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, 3 developed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> (AI), and 15 developed moderate AI, for an 8-year freedom from significant AI of 67% +/- 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>But freedom from AI was 90% +/- 3% after the technique of reimplantation, and 55% +/- 6% after the technique of remodeling (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysms</z:hpo>, the freedom from AI greater than 2+ at 8 years was 67% +/- 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The long-term results of aortic valve sparing for aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are excellent, and reimplantation of the aortic valve may provide a more stable repair of the aortic valve than remodeling of the aortic root </plain></SENT>
