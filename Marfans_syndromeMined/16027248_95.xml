<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A genetic predisposition for progressive enlargement of thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> leading to type A dissection (TAAD) is inherited in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal-dominant</z:hpo> manner in up to 19% of patients, and a number of chromosomal loci have been identified for the condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Having mapped a TAAD locus to 3p24-25, we sequenced the gene for transforming growth factor-beta receptor type II (TGFBR2) to determine whether mutations in this gene resulted in familial TAAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We sequenced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 8 coding exons of TGFBR2 by using genomic DNA from 80 unrelated familial TAAD cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found TGFBR2 mutations in 4 unrelated families with familial TAAD who did not have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Affected family members also had descending <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of other arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 mutations affected an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32700">arginine residue</z:chebi> at position 460 in the intracellular domain, suggesting a mutation "hot spot" for familial TAAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite identical mutations in the families, assessment of linked polymorphisms suggested that these families were not distantly related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Structural analysis of the TGFBR2 serine/threonine kinase domain revealed that R460 is strategically located within a highly conserved region of this domain and that the amino acid substitutions resulting from these mutations will interfere with the receptor's ability to transduce signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Germline TGFBR2 mutations are responsible for the inherited predisposition to familial TAAD in 5% of these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results have broad implications for understanding the role of TGF-beta signaling in the pathophysiology of TAAD </plain></SENT>
