<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aortic valve leaflets are often overstretched and the fibrosa layer is damaged in many patients, particularly in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the stigmata of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in some patients the leaflets are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or only minimally stretched in spite of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these patients the aortic valve can be satisfactorily repaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When significant annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> is present, the reconstructive procedure consists of excising <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three aortic sinuses and reimplanting the aortic valve inside a Dacron graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If the annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> is mild and the principal problem is loss of the sinotubular junction because of aneurysmal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the sinuses of Valsalva, aortic valve repair is accomplished by replacing one, two, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three aortic sinuses with a properly tailored Dacron graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first type of aortic valve repair has been performed in 18 patients with one early and one late failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other 16 patients remained well from 3 to 50 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The second type of aortic valve repair has been performed in 15 patients during the past 3 years without any failure and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients remain well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in selected patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> due to aortic root and/or ascending aorta <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1285162" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">degenerative disease</z:e>, the aortic valve can be repaired with satisfactory results </plain></SENT>
