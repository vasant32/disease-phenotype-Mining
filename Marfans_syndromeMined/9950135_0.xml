<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a case of a giant <z:mp ids='MP_0008854'>bulla</z:mp> in a 16-year-old boy who was oxygen and wheelchair dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He had been diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002751'>kyphoscoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The giant <z:mp ids='MP_0008854'>bulla</z:mp> occupying his entire left thoracic cavity compressed the contralateral lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Until referral to our hospital, a bullectomy had been deferred during the preceding 5 years because of his poor pulmonary function and severe chest wall deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient was considered a candidate for thoracoscopic bullectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A stepwise resection technique was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>First, the <z:mp ids='MP_0008854'>bulla</z:mp> should be emptied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> or wall <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Second, the redundant wall of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008854'>bulla</z:mp> should be resected by a looped ligation without opening the cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Third, a stapled resection of the downsized <z:mp ids='MP_0008854'>bulla</z:mp> should be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After a successful bullectomy, his subjective symptoms and pulmonary function improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The reduction of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008854'>bulla</z:mp> makes bullectomy easily and decreases the number of staplers, and reduces operating time compared with opening the <z:mp ids='MP_0008854'>bulla</z:mp> and suturing it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, when treating a giant <z:mp ids='MP_0008854'>bulla</z:mp>, we recommend a stepwise resection technique </plain></SENT>
