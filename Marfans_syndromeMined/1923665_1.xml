<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There have been few previous studies of pulmonary function tests and none of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085129" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bronchial hyperreactivity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, pulmonary function tests were performed in 11 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and 11 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bronchial responsiveness was tested in ten of the Marfan patients by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6804">methacholine</z:chebi> challenge test and response to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35523">bronchodilator</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because of disproportionate length of legs in Marfan patients, an "ideal" standing height was calculated from sitting height </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary function tests, as absolute values or as percent predicted based on "ideal" height, were not different in Marfan patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath>, although a few individual patients had abnormal function (mostly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">airway obstruction</z:e> and hyperinflation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6804">methacholine</z:chebi> challenge was positive on forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75% VC (FEF25-75%), and FEF50%, in 37.5%, 60%, and 70% of tests respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant response to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35523">bronchodilators</z:chebi> was obtained in 40% of patients as measured by FEV1, in 90% by FEF25-75% and in 100% by FEF50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary function tests after <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35523">bronchodilator</z:chebi> were significantly higher when compared with values before the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35523">bronchodilator</z:chebi> as well as with the baseline before <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6804">methacholine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, most if not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> had hyperreactive airways in this relatively small group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Even though only one patient had a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo>, six more had subtle symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that tests for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085129" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bronchial hyperreactivity</z:e> could be part of the routine investigation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further studies on larger numbers of patients are still needed </plain></SENT>
