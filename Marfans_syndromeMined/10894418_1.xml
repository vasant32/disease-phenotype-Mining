<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>High nasal airway resistance (NAR) has been reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, and this appears to contribute to the development of obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnoea</z:hpo> in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cause of high NAR in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> is unknown, but these patients characteristically have a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002010'>narrow maxilla</z:hpo>, which could have an influence on nasal dimensions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to define the mechanism(s) mediating high NAR in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (mean age 29+/-4 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) years) were compared with an equivalent number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects (31+/-1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NAR was measured by posterior rhinomanometry, before and after topical decongestant, nasal stenting, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dental impressions were taken to evaluate maxillary arch <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, allowing measurement of the following lateral distances: inter-canine (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>), inter-premolar (IPD), and inter-molar (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16069">IMD</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NAR (at a flow of 500 ccm/s) was considerably higher in patients compared with controls at baseline (0.93+/-0.08 vs 0.35+/-0.08 Pa/ccm/s, p &lt; 0.001), and following decongestant and/or stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The maxillary arch was considerably narrower in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were strong inverse correlations between the lateral maxillary dimensions and NAR after nasal decongestant, with or without stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate a strong association between maxillary width and NAR, and suggest that maxillary constriction is the dominant mechanism for the high NAR in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic implications of this finding warrant further investigation </plain></SENT>
