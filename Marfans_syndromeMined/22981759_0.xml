<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study compared aortic biomechanics in different heritable aortopathy syndromes and examined the clinical utility of aortic stiffness measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In 218 patients (55 Marfan, 47 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp>), 47 isolated familial thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (FTAD) and 69 matched controls) aortic biomechanics were measured by echocardiography with simultaneous blood pressure measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were stratified by age as ≤40 years or &gt;40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aortic stiffness increased with age and aortic biomechanics were abnormal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aortopathies, particularly in <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp> and FTAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increased stiffness and pulse wave velocity were seen in <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp> and FTAD in both age cohorts (p&lt;0.001) and both were stiffer than Marfan patients (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Marfan patients aged ≤40 years had stiffer aortas than controls, but those &gt;40 years were similar to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression identified age as the dominant correlate with increased stiffness, and also aortic diameter and mean blood pressure (R(2)=0.64; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aortopathy patients with stiffness index&gt;16 had lower rate of increase in aortic diameter (0.25±0.30mm/year) than those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stiffness (0.68±0.39mm/year, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whilst positive predictive value of increased stiffness for detection of aortopathy was high (93% in age≤40 years, 87%, in age&gt;40 years), negative predictive accuracy was low (55% and 34% respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Abnormal biomechanics are common to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aortopathies, with greater abnormality in <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp> and FTAD than in Marfan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increased aortic stiffness is associated with slower rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> progression </plain></SENT>
