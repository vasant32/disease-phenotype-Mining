<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They result in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> control, wound coverage, and preservation of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Minimal experience exists with the use of these techniques in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We review our experience with vascularized muscle flaps between 1985 and 1993 in treating life-threatening mediastinal wounds in 8 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 8 patients ranged in age from 1 day to 10 years; mean age was 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025064" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mediastinitis</z:e>; one had an exposed Gore-Tex graft, and the other had an exposed homograft conduit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient had a midline defect with exposed right ventricle immediately beneath the skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient had tracheal dehiscence after repair of an acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002575'>tracheoesophageal fistula</z:hpo> from battery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000766'>pectus deformity</z:hpo> and an unstable sternum after emergent reoperation for a false <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two neonates had their sternum left open with a temporary Silastic skin patch after orthotopic cardiac transplantation because of swelling of the donor heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One transplant patient had wound dehiscence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Vascularized muscle flaps used to heal the mediastinal wounds in this group included pectoralis major (10), rectus abdominis (3), and cervical strap (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One infant with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001746'>asplenia</z:hpo> and an exposed Gore-Tex graft that had a delayed vascularized muscle flap died of Candida <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Seven of 8 patients (85%) healed their mediastinal wound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Prompt recognition of thoracic wound complications facilitates immediate surgical intervention to obtain primary closure with vascularized muscle flaps, which promotes rapid healing in these children </plain></SENT>
