<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate accommodation in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> using optical coherence tomography (OCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Clinical case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS AND CONTROLS: The study included 31 eyes of 31 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and 31 eyes of 31 unaffected controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subgroups of eyes of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> with and without a subluxated lens also were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The changes in the anterior segment during accommodation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235238" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cycloplegia</z:e> were studied with OCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Accommodative power, anterior chamber depth (ACD), lens thickness, and pupil diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No difference in accommodative power or ACD were found between the groups (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lens was thicker in the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (P = 0.017 at baseline; P = 0.043 during accommodation; P = 0.046 during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The baseline pupil diameter was smaller in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (P = 0.01), decreased less during accommodation (P = 0.02), and increased more during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> compared with controls (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No difference was found in these variables between the subgroups of eyes of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> with and without a subluxated lens (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggested that even though the pupil and crystalline lens are affected in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, these patients have the same ability to accommodate as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
