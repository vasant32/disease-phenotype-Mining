<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aortic wall of the human ascending aorta from 44 patients operated on for annulo-aortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> (AAE) was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Light microscopy revealed significantly greater cystic change, elastic fragmentation, <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and disappearance of smooth muscle cells in aortic media in AAE than in control specimens taken at autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Occasional aortae, however, were morphologically almost <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight of the patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed between them and the other 36 patients, except for a tendency to have less pronounced <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 9 patients who, in addition to the changes mentioned, had advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, and their aortae showed more extensive <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pooling of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> matrix, degeneration of elastic lamellae, increased amount of collagen and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of smooth muscle cells characterized the electron microscopic findings of 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The collagen fibers seemed to be of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> shape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, changes in annulo-aortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> are characterized by severe cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The changes are basically similar in Marfan and non-Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
