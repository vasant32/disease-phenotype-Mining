<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were three hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the Marfan group, but none in the rheumatic and degenerative groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The late postoperative survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 98% and 94%, respectively, in the rheumatic group; 84% and 84%, respectively, in the degenerative group; and 85% and 78%, respectively, in the Marfan group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An analysis of the late complications disclosed a higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and paravalvular leakage in the degenerative and Marfan groups than in the rheumatic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the degenerative group, 4 of the 32 patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> within 3 years following aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aortic root diameter in these 4 patients was more than 40 mm at the time of surgery, whereas it was less than 40 mm in the remaining 28 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, considering the progressive nature of myxomatous degeneration, patients with a severely <z:mp ids='MP_0011575'>dilated aortic root</z:mp> diameter should be monitored carefully with echocardiography after surgery </plain></SENT>
