<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Chronobiological rhythms have been shown to influence the occurrence of a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the effects of the time of the day, the day of the week, or monthly/seasonal changes on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (AAD) have not been well studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Accordingly, we evaluated 957 patients enrolled in the International Registry of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic Dissection</z:hpo> (IRAD) between 1996 and 2000 (mean age 62+/-14 years, type A 61%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A chi2 test for goodness of fit and partial Fourier analysis were used to evaluate nonuniformity and rhythmicity of AAD during circadian, weekly, and monthly periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher frequency of AAD occurred from 6:00 AM to 12:00 noon compared with other time periods (12:00 noon to 6:00 PM, 6:00 PM to 12:00 midnight, and 12:00 midnight to 6:00 AM; P&lt;0.001 by chi2 test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourier analysis showed a highly significant circadian variation (P&lt;0.001) with a peak between 8:00 AM and 9:00 AM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although no significant variation was found for the day of the week, the frequency of AAD was significantly higher during winter (P=0.008 versus other seasons by chi2 test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourier analysis confirmed this monthly variation with a peak in January (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis identified a significant association for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subgroups with circadian rhythmicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, seasonal/monthly variations were observed only among patients aged &lt;70 years, those with type B AAD, and those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Similar to other cardiovascular conditions, AAD exhibits significant circadian and seasonal/monthly variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings may have important implications for the prevention of AAD by tailoring treatment strategies to ensure maximal benefits during the vulnerable periods </plain></SENT>
