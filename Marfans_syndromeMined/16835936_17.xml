<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 27 FBN1 mutations (22 novel) in 27 patients (55%, 27/49), 1 novel TGFBR1 mutation in 1 (2%, 1/49), and 2 recurrent TGFBR2 mutations in 2 (4%, 2/49) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No FBN2 mutation was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients with either TGFBR1 or TGFBR2 abnormality did not fulfill the Ghent criteria, but expressed some overlapping features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 19 patients, either of the genes did not show any abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study indicated that FBN1 mutations were predominant in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> but TGFBRs defects may account for approximately 5-10% of patients with the syndrome </plain></SENT>
