<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Successful surgical treatment of type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> with annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> (AAE) and severely destroyed aortic root was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between April 1991 and April 1996, 26 patients with type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> underwent the surgical treatment in our institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among those cases, 4 cases (15%) needed the total aortic root replacement with composite graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two cases had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and AAE and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other two cases had severely destroyed aortic root because of the extension and advancement of the dissection to the aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One was the case of disrupted right coronary ostia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>And another was the case of frank rupture and massive <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> from the aortic root during the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cases of AAE were treated successfully by the routine composite graft that was made before the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the reconstruction of the aortic root for the cases who had destroyed aortic root with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> relation and size of the aortic root was cumbersome because of non displaced coronary artery ostia and the relatively narrow aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For these cases, composite graft was fixed just below the aortic valve annulus by the sutures enforced with <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53251">Teflon</z:chebi> felt strip from the outside of the aorta and it made the reimplantation of the coronary ostia easier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As for the technique of the reimplantation of the coronary ostia, Carrel patch technique was used because good coaptation and fixation of the suture line around the coronary ostia could be obtained with this technique which prevent the complication such as the pseudoaneurysm or the periostial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation around the coronary artery in the long term period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Concomitant procedures were aortic arch replacement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, total arch replacement with four vessels graft in 3 cases and hemiarch replacement in 1 case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Each operations were performed with the aid of selective cerebral perfusion and open distal anastomosis </plain></SENT>
