<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Predictive genetic testing may enable prophylaxis and promote clinical follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) is known as a monogenic disorder, according to the present diagnostic criteria a mutation in the gene FBN1 is not sufficient for the diagnosis, which also depends on the presence of a number of clinical, radiological, and other findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fact that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patient cohorts only infrequently have been examined for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> relevant phenotypic manifestations may have contributed to inconsistent reports of genotype-phenotype correlations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the Norwegian Study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants were examined for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> findings contained in the Ghent nosology by the same investigators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutation identification was carried out by robot-assisted direct sequencing of the entire FBN1 coding sequence and MLPA analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 46 mutations were identified in 44 unrelated patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fulfilling Ghent criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although no statistically significant correlation could be obtained, the data indicate associations between missense or splice site mutations and ocular manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While mutations in TGF-domains were associated with the fulfillment of few major criteria, severe affection was indicated in two cases with C-terminal mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intrafamilial phenotypic variation among carriers of the same mutation, suggesting the influence of epigenetic facors, complicates genetic counseling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The usefulness of predictive genetic testing in FBN1 mutations requires further investigation </plain></SENT>
