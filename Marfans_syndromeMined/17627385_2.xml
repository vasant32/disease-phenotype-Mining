<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutation detection of this 65-exon gene presents a particular challenge for the diagnostic service in cost, time constraints, and the need to maintain a stringently optimized assay procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC), we have designed a procedure for rapid mutation scanning, redesigning 50% of published primer sets, screening by Ensembl to avoid inclusion of polymorphic variations and employing a limited set of PCR conditions to allow for a high-throughput 96-well format </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mutations include 55 missense (53.4%) 19 splice site (18.5%), 17 frameshift (16.5%), 11 nonsense (10.7%) and 1 in-frame deletion/insertion </plain></SENT>
