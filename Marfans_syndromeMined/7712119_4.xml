<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic linkage analysis with random probes has mapped the MS locus to 15q21.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There have been several reports of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> co-segregating with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> within families, which suggest that a common genetic factor may be shared between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> susceptibility and MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This could be due to a cytogenetic abnormality affecting both genetic loci or due to co-segregation of two disease loci near each other on the same chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We tested this hypothesis by using genetic linkage analysis with multiplex families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using three genetic markers spanning the MS locus, we were unable to find evidence of linkage with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> across the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> locus on chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
