<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 15 eyes of 15 cases having undertaken in situ phacoemulsification <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1398740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vitreous loss</z:e>, 12 eyes of 12 cases in ECCE, 3 eyes of 2 cases in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan Syndrome</z:e>, 13 eyes of 13 cases in eye injury, tunnel incision was made and PC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e> implantation was performed after high gluey Healon managing anterior vitreous on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High gluey Healon managing anterior vitreous in 43 eyes, post capsule injuries was not enlarge, and cortex or fragments of len nuclear not fall in vitreous cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity of 0.5 or better at postoperative one week were 72.1% and 59.1% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The technique of managing anterior vitreous by high gluey Healon was worthy to be spread due to minimum injury, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1398740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vitreous loss</z:e>, and fast restoration of visual acuity </plain></SENT>
