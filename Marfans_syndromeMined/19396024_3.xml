<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Major progress such as the identification of genetic causes has recently enhanced the delineation of the characteristic and non-characteristic manifestations, phenotype-genotype correlations and knowledge of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, the possibilities for distinction between the different <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> disorders have increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with either typical or non-typical features in whom no molecular abnormalities are found, form a basis for further research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Identification of new pathogenic alterations in these patients, best exemplified by the Marfan-related syndromes, has provided further understanding of the regulatory gene network involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In light of recent developments and as an aid to the diagnostic process, the aim of this review is to give a comprehensive overview of the clinical, molecular genetic and pathophysiological aspects of each of the classic and new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
