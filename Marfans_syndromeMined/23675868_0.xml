<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is curative for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, but may not prevent the development of non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe a 26-year-old male patient with FA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who in 1994 underwent successful HSCT with bone marrow stem cells from his human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sister </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 2006, three lesions in the liver were detected and resected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The three lesions <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> showed activation of the Î²-catenin pathway and were histologically characterized by a highly differentiated steatotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp>) with remnants of the underlying <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> from which it arose, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0012028'>hepatocellular adenoma</z:hpo> with foci of well-differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp>, and a cholestatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for the emergence of <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> included FA itself, the use of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> for a period of 3 years preceding HSCT and toxicity of the conditioning regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because of the danger of developing additional <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp>, liver transplantation was proposed, taking into consideration that immunosuppression would increase the risk of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By using part of the liver of the sister, who already acted as bone marrow donor 13 years earlier, immunosuppression could be avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Liver transplantation was performed in 2007 without complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five years after liver transplantation the patient is doing well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This case is twofold special being the first case reporting FA co-occurring with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and being the first reported case of FA treated for <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> by liver transplantation from a HLA-identical sibling donor without the use of immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
