<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Similarly, although the identification of the basic defect in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> had been vigorously pursued for several decades, it was only in 1991 that two independent reports implicated fibrillin as the defective gene product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly and serendipitously, these studies also revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the fibrillin proteins and established linkage between one of these loci and a Marfan-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disorder, congenital</z:e> contractural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, this condition is accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>skeletal abnormalities</z:hpo>; however, flexion <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>joint contractures</z:hpo> replace the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001388'>loose-jointedness</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and, more importantly, neither the eye nor the aorta are affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More recently, a similar association with the fibrillin gene has also been established in the dominantly inherited form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These associations of structurally related gene products with Marfan and related syndromes may conceivably imply that other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> are caused by mutations in these or other yet undiscovered fibrillin genes </plain></SENT>
