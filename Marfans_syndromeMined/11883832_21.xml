<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors examined a group of patients suffering from spontaneous spinal CSF leaks who also had minor skeletal features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> for abnormalities of fibrillin-containing microfibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with spontaneous CSF leaks were evaluated for the clinical characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Skin biopsies were obtained in three patients with skeletal manifestations that constitute part of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cultured fibroblasts were studied for fibrillin-1 synthesis and incorporation into the extracellular matrix (ECM) by performing quantitative metabolic labeling and immunohistochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 20 consecutive patients found to have spinal CSF leaks, four (20%) exhibited minor skeletal features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, but lacked any ocular or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001626'>cardiovascular abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age of these patients (30 years) was lower than that of the 16 patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>skeletal abnormalities</z:hpo> (44 years; p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities in fibrillin-1 metabolism and immunostaining were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>skeletal abnormalities</z:hpo> who underwent examination, but not in a control patient without these skeletal manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Twenty percent of patients who experience spontaneous spinal CSF leaks have minor skeletal features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The authors demonstrated abnormalities in fibrillin-1 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_45'>protein deposition</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients examined, but only one person was found to have a fibrillin-1 abnormality typically found in classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that there is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> involvement of other components of ECM microfibrils at the basis of this cerebrospinal manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, the authors identified a connective-tissue etiological factor in a group of disorders not previously classified as such </plain></SENT>
