<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The chest CT showed the extention of the ascending aorta without the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient was taken into the clinic in a very bad general condition with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo>, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023212" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">left ventricular failure</z:e> together with pulse absence in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> standard places of pulse measurement in the left lower limb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the TEE examination the dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of type I according to De Bakey's classification and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> function of the artificial aortic valve were recognized </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After the cardiosurgical intervention the ischaemic symptoms of the left lower limb retreated, the size of the heart diminished in the chest X-ray and TTE examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 45% to 62% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The TEE of the patient proved the most accurate and precise method of the diagnosis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
