<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Long-term results of aortic root replacements and the factors affecting long-term mortality were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We operated on 254 patients from June 1993 to November 2008 for aortic root replacement with Bentall de Bono procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two hundred five patients were male (80.7%) and 49 patients (19.3%) were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 48.3 +/- 14.7 years (range, 14 to 78 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed 72 concomitant procedures in 69 patients, and the most commonly performed procedure was coronary artery bypass grafting in 37 patients (14.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common indication for aortic root replacement was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in 235 patients (92.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients (13.4%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> was used in 52 patients (20.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After removing the clamp, we had to reclamp the aorta in 26 patients (10.2%) undergoing operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postoperatively 30 patients (11.8%) had in-hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The late mortality was 2.8% (7 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most common reason for hospital mortality was low cardiac output (18 in 30 patients; 51.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Neurologic complications were seen in 16 patients (6.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of hospital stay was 16.6 +/- 11.3 days (range, 5 to 77 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Postoperative follow-up was 6.3 +/- 4.5 years (range, 0 to 15.5 years) on average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Late mortality was significantly affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (p = 0.025) and reclamping the aorta (p = 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival for the overall 254 patients is 88.4% +/- 2.1%, 87.4% +/- 2.2%, and 84.5% +/- 2.56% at 1, 3, and 10 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The late-term results of aortic root replacement with the modified Bentall de Bono procedure are satisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Survival is decreased in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and in the patients who had reclamping intraoperatively </plain></SENT>
