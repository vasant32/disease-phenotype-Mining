<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis is critical in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of the large size of fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1), the uniqueness of mutations, and the absence of genotype-to-phenotype correlations linkage analysis can be very helpful for early diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, eight polymorphic markers were evaluated among families related to an affected pedigree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: An extended family in Birjand, Iran, with numerous cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan Syndrome</z:e> in three consecutive generations, is being reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consented members of these families, peripheral blood samples were collected in tubes containing EDTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA extraction was performed by the conventional salting-out method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight STR markers were selected for linkage analysis, including four intragenic markers (MTS1, MTS2, MTS3, and MTS4) and another four flanking FBN1 markers (D15S119, D15S126, D15S1028, and D15S143) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PCR-amplified fragments were evaluated on 15% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MTS1, MTS2, and MTS3 were informative in the extended pedigree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>D5S1028 was the only non-MTS marker which showed an informative diagnostic capability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MTS markers were informative and useful in the molecular diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan Syndrome</z:e> in an extended pedigree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MTS1, MTS2, and MTS3 can be used as a prenatal or presymptomatic diagnosis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> members of the extended pedigree </plain></SENT>
