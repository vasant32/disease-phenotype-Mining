<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deficient fibrillin-1 is thought to result in the failed sequestration of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) and subsequent activation of the TGFβ signaling pathway, suggesting that the circulating TGFβ level may be elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, although its accurate measurement is complex due to ex vivo release from platelet stores upon platelet activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured the plasma TGFβ1 levels of 32 Japanese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients (22 medically untreated, 10 treated, 20 males, 30.1 ± 9.6 years old) and 30 healthy volunteers (19 males, 29.5 ± 5.8 years old) by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30682">ruthenium</z:chebi>-based electrochemiluminescence platform (ECL) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the mean plasma TGFβ1 level between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> group (1.31 ± 0.40 ng/mL) and controls (1.17 ± 0.33 ng/mL) (P = 0.16, NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, there was no significant difference between the untreated (1.24 ± 0.37 ng/mL) and treated (1.46 �� 0.45 ng/mL) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients (P = 0.15, NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also measured <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi>, which showed wide deviations but no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A difference in circulating TGFβ1 levels between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients and controls was not detected in this Japanese population </plain></SENT>
