<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A variety of proteins compose the structure of microfibrils, the most prominent of which are the two fibrillins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin-1 is encoded by FBN1 on human chromosome 15q21 and fibrillin-2 is encoded by FBN2 on 5q23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each fibrillin monomer contains a large number of epidermal growth factor-like motifs, most capable of binding <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39124">calcium ions</z:chebi>, and a few motifs resembling the binding protein for transforming growth factor beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro polymerization of fibrillin monomers produces 'beads on a string' structures that look on electron microscopy much like microfibrils purified from the extracellular matrices of a variety of tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutations in FBN1 produce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, a pleiotropic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> with prominent manifestations in the skeleton, eye and cardiovascular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A number of conditions related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> are also due to FBN1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Contractural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo> is due to mutations in FBN2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this paper we review the published mutations in these genes, preliminary results of genotype-phenotype correlations, and speculations regarding molecular pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
