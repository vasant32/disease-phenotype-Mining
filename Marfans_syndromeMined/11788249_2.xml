<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between January 1989 and December 2000, 212 patients underwent ARR with a CG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 56+/-14 years, ranging from 16 to 77 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> was the most frequent cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> in this series, 81 (38%) patients, followed by atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> 57 (27%) and type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> 52 (24.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> was present in 37 (17.5%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Duration of follow-up ranged from 1 to 120 months, mean 59+/-35 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall hospital mortality was 16 (7.5%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight of them had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most frequently found complication resulted to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> in 22 (10%) patients and low cardiac output in 15 (7%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, neurological complications, respiratory complications, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> incidence were significantly higher in patients with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time &gt;170 min, CA &gt;40 min, and total aortic arch replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival at 1, 3 and 5 years resulted to be 91.8, 86 and 81.5%, instead the actuarial survival without re-operation resulted to be 89, 82 and 78% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> was significantly lower versus non-dissection (P=0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The multivariate analysis revealed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (P=0.03), age &gt;65 years (P=0.014), associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (P=0.002), NYHA functional class&gt;/=3 (P=0.027), LVEF &lt;35% (P=0.002) and total arch reconstruction (P=0.003) as strong predictors for poor overall survival in patients undergoing ARR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The ARR with a CG offers acceptable early and long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The predictors for poor overall survival in patients undergoing ARR seems to be preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> extended into the aortic arch, older age, depressed left ventricular function and associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
