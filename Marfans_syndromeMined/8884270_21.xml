<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A spectrum of mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) have been identified in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>), and the majority of mutations resulting in the neonatal and often lethal form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> have been identified in the restricted region of exons 24-32 of the FBN1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report a novel point mutation in exon 25 of the FBN1 gene in a patient with lethal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mutation resulted in a molecular defect rarely encountered in human diseases, the creation of an extra consensus sequence for N-glycosylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Metabolic labeling of the patient fibroblast culture and in vitro expression of the mutagenized cDNA construct suggest that this novel N-glycosylation site is actually utilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analyses of the fibroblast cultures of the patient show that this excessive N-glycosylation severely affects microfibril formation in vitro; this finding emphasizes the importance of correct posttranslational modifications of fibrillin molecules for correct aggregation into microfibrillar structures </plain></SENT>
