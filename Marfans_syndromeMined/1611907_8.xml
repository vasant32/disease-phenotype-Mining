<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Earlier studies had shown that the expression of the gene coding for one eminent connective tissue <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi>, decorin (DCN), is deficient in the fibroblasts of 3 out of 15 Marfan patients (Pulkkinen et al., 1990) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To obtain more information on the expression of this gene, various human tissues and cell lines were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of decorin were detected in aorta, lung, skin, kidney, smooth muscle, and placenta, whereas significantly lower <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were found in the rest of the tissues analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two sizes of transcripts were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two transcripts of decorin most probably do not represent two different genes, since in situ hybridization gave only one strong signal, placing the gene in 12q21----q22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No tissue-specific differences in the two <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> species of decorin were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is in contrast to the gene of versican, another connective tissue <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> gene, that was analyzed as a control; high expression of a longer transcript of the versican gene was found in brain and smooth muscle, whereas the shorter transcript was predominant in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other tissues studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DCN was actively transcribed in cultured mesenchymal cells, whereas in cells of endothelial or epithelial origin, the transcription level was undetectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These tissue- and cell type-specific variations in the expression of DCN may help to explain the complex phenotypic variation typical of individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
