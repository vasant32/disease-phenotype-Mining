<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From December 1989 to May 1999 the ascending aorta was replaced with 148 composite xenopericardial conduits aorta in 145 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biological valves were inserted in 28 conduits, mechanical valves - in 116 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The age of 40 female (28%) and 105 male (72%) patients ranged from 10 to 60 years (mean, 38.7+/-12 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The original diseases were: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in 51 (35%), cystic media <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in 50 (35%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in 35 (24%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> in three (2%), non-specific <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp> in one (0.7%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Turner syndrome</z:e> in one and infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> in four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic dissection</z:hpo> was found in 67 patients (46%): type I in 14 (23%) and type II in 53 (77%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients (15%) were operated on during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of the dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Bentall-DeBono technique was used in 144 operations, in four cases (2.7%) supracoronary resection was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Associated procedures included: mitral valve repair (five), CABG (four), resection of the coarctation (two), MV replacement (two) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Biological tissues condition was assessed using TTE TEE and computed tomography (CT) scanning technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hospital mortality was 8.3 % (12 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was caused by: low cardiac output (three), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (two), neurological complications (one), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> (one), polyorgan failure (four), <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Non-lethal complications included: <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (four), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (two), persisting A-V block (two), polyorgan failure (three), cerebral (two), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025064" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mediastinitis</z:e> (three), and early prosthetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> were successfully re-operated and conduit replaced with the same type of the device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Late follow-up ranged from 2 months to 8 years (mean, 51 months) and complete in 87% of the discharged patients (115 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There were four valve-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> due to thrombembolia and five <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> non related to the valve and/or conduit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Clinical and instrumental evaluation did not reveal any signs of tissue degeneration at the conduit and biovalves' cusps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The xenopericardial valved conduit is an effective and acceptable device for the replacement of ascending aorta in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, it provides good early and late results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>It's pliability and elasticity are especially attractive in situations with frail tissues and high risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
