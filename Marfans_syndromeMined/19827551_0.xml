<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1993 and 2008, the aortic valve sparing surgery was performed in 94 patients having <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty patients of them (37.2 +/- 13.4 years, 50 male) had cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in the aortic wall, which was confirmed the pathological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reviewed these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty percent (48/80) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, 5% (4/80) had Loeyz-Dietz syndrome, 2% (2/80) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo>, and 11% (9/80) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our reimplantation procedure has been refined as followed: with a tube graft in 41, a tube graft with creation of neo-sinuses in 11, and a Valsalva graft in 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients underwent the remodeling procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The follow-up rate was 100% with the duration of 3.7+/- 3.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> but six late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seventeen (21.3%) patients required aortic valve replacement, for recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> in 13 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Freedom from reoperation was 80%, 43%, and freedom from moderate or severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> was 80%, 54%, at 5 and 10 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pathological findings of the aortic valve obtained in the reoperations showed elongation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> of the aortic valve due to myxomatous degeneration and fibrous thickening caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Even in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e>, aortic valve sparing operation is associated with acceptable long-term durability, although cusp degeneration resulting in recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> might be progressive </plain></SENT>
