<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have isolated a cDNA for human LO from skin fibroblast poly(A+)<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> by PCR using primers based on the recently published sequence of human LO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This cDNA probe detects a major <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of 4.2 kb on Northern blots of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The level of LO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was not significantly affected by cell density or by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22651">ascorbate</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment of skin fibroblasts with hydralazine (50 microM), which increases the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> for both the alpha and the beta subunits of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26274,32874">prolyl</z:chebi> hydroxylase (PH) and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32568">lysyl</z:chebi> hydroxylase, also increased LO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> by fourfold over a 72-h time course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, hydralazine dramatically decreased the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> for alpha 1(I) collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6942">minoxidil</z:chebi> (500 microM), which specifically decreases LH activity without affecting PH activity or collagen biosynthesis in skin fibroblasts, stimulated the level of LO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50868,7959">penicillamine</z:chebi> (100 microM), which interferes with collagen cross-linking, nor the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27413">beta-aminopropionitrile</z:chebi>, which is a strong irreversible inhibitor of LO, to fibroblasts significantly changed the levels of LO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> over a 72-h time course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> (0.6 microgram/ml) significantly decreased the 4.2-kb LO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in contrast to the levels of the alpha 1(I) collagen <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi>, which were unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant change was observed in the steady-state levels of LO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> in fibroblasts isolated from patients with certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022716" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MNK">Menkes disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000973'>cutis laxa</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033847" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PXE">pseudoxanthoma elasticum</z:e> </plain></SENT>
