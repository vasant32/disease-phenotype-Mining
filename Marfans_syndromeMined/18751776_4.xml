<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This may or may not place the Marfan patient at increased risk for bone fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In comparing the BMDs of our patients with those reported in the literature, it seemed that agreement between values, and hence the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000938'>osteopenia</z:hpo> reported, was dependent on the instrumentation used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to statistically assess this impression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bone mineral density measurements from our previously published study of 30 adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> performed on a Lunar DPXL machine were compared with studies published between 1993-2000 measured using either Lunar or Hologic bone densitometry instruments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The differences of our measurements compared with those made on other Lunar machines were not statistically significant, but did differ significantly with published results from Hologic machines (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Before progress can be made in the assessment of BMD and fracture risk in Marfan patients and in the evidence-based orthopedic management of these patients, standardization of instrumental bone density determinations will be required along with considerations of height, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, age, and sex </plain></SENT>
