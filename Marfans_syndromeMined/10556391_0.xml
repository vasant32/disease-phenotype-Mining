<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The commonly used criteria for elective aortic root replacement are an aortic root dimension &gt;50 mm or an aortic dimension more than twice the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> predicted value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He did not fulfill these criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>His ascending aortic dimension 17 days prior to his <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 48 mm and the aortic dimension to the predicted value was 1.8, although he showed progressive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A ratio of the ascending aortic dimension of more than 1.5 times that predicted, as proposed by Pyeritz, and a considerable increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> beyond previous observations may lead to timely surgical repair </plain></SENT>
