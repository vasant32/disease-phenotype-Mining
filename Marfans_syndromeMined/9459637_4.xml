<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a 49-year-old woman with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who underwent total thyroidectomy for follicular <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was given 100 mCi of radioactive <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> (131I) followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18332">levothyroxine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18332">LT4</z:chebi>) 0.2 mg/day after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subsequent five total body scans were negative and thyroglobulin (TG) measurements ranged between undetectable levels to 12 ng/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine years after thyroidectomy the patient developed bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>exophthalmos</z:hpo> with markedly positive thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI), indicating the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018213" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Graves' disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TG levels increased and concurrently <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> that did not concentrate radioiodine at tracer doses, were diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Due to these metastatic lesions, the patient received a therapeutic dose of 150 mCi of 131I 1 month after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18332">LT4</z:chebi> withdrawal, and a total body scan was made 10 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Slight uptake of 131I was found in the right side of the neck, whereas predominant uptake occurred in the right lung base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the elevated TSI played a role in the growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
