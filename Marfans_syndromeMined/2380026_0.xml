<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the relatively favorable outcome of surgical compared with medical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, surgery is now more frequently considered, even in asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRI is an excellent diagnostic tool for evaluating the thoracic aorta and has been suggested as a replacement for preoperative cardiac catheterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the case presented here, MRI preoperative confirmation of a 6.0-cm <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> in an asymptomatic 38-year-old man with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, was followed by composite ascending aorta and aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The postoperative course was good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This case supports the view that <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> replacement can be performed based on a noninvasive preoperative evaluation using MRI </plain></SENT>
