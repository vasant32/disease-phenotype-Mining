<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In individuals with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>), mutations have been identified in the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) at 15q21.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A proline-to-alanine change at position 1148 in exon 27 (Pro1148Ala) has been reported in probands with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> or Marfanoid-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was suggested that this mutation could be a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo>, since it was rarely observed in control populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate further the pathogenicity of this substitution, we screened 416 unrelated control individuals by allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found 16 individuals who carried the alanine allele (3.8%), 3 of whom were homozygous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five were of Latin American and eight were of Asian extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also screened 133 probands with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> or related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> and found 4 (3%) that were heterozygous for the 1148Ala allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> positive results were confirmed by DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 20 individuals with 1148Ala, we confirmed the association with the rarer A allele at the IVS27-5G--&gt;A polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the Pro1148Ala change is a polymorphism of ancient evolutionary origin that is more prevalent in Asian and Latin American than in Caucasian or African populations </plain></SENT>
