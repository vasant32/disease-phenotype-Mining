<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We retrospectively analyzed 28 years of experience with the Bentall procedure in patients with aortic valve, aortic root, and ascending <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 1982 and December 2010, a total of 218 patients underwent the Bentall procedure using a composite valved conduit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The "inclusion technique" was used in 30 patients (13.8%), the "open-button technique" in 181 patients (83.0%), and the Cabrol technique in 7 patients (3.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The early mortality rate was 5.5% (12/218) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up duration was 108.0Â±81.0 months (range: 1-329 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients required re-operation, and 1 patient required stent graft insertion at the descending thoracic aorta for progression of aortic arch or descending thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> after the first operation, and 5 of them had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier estimated survival rates at 1, 5, 10, 20, and 25 years were 90.4%, 82.7%, 77.6%, 65.3%, and 60.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Freedom from reoperation rates at 1, 5, 10, 20, and 25 years were 99.0%, 98.3%, 95.5%, 90.8%, and 90.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our experience, the Bentall procedure provided optimal survival with improved functional status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disease of the aorta</z:e> may progress, especially in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, careful follow-up with regular computed tomography angiograms should be performed in these patients </plain></SENT>
