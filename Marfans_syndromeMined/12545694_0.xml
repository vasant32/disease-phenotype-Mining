<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Angle-closure <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> is rare in children and young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only scattered cases associated with specific clinical entities have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the findings in patients in our database aged 40 or younger with angle closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our database was searched for patients with angle closure who were 40 years old or younger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data recorded included age at initial consultation; age at the time of diagnosis; gender; results of slit-lamp examination, gonioscopy, and ultrasound biomicroscopy (from 1993 onward); clinical diagnosis; and therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with previous incisional surgery were excluded, as were patients with anterior chamber proliferative mechanisms leading to angle closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients (49 females, 18 males) met entry criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean age (+/- SD) at the time of consultation was 34.4 +/- 9.4 years (range, 3-68 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1321345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">plateau iris syndrome</z:e> (35 patients), iridociliary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> (8 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e> (7 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> (5 patients), isolated nanophthalmos (3 patients), relative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1273758" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pupillary block</z:e> (2 patients), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265313" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Weill-Marchesani syndrome</z:e> (3 patients), and 1 patient each with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51068">miotic</z:chebi>-induced angle closure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0007968'>persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous</z:hpo>, and idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001132'>lens subluxation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The etiology of angle closure in young persons is different from that in the older population and is typically associated with structural or developmental ocular anomalies rather than relative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1273758" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pupillary block</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Following laser iridotomy, these eyes should be monitored for recurrent angle closure and the need for additional laser or incisional surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
