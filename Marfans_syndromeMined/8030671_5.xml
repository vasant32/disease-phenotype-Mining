<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using Q-scores, we compared metacarpophalangeal pattern profile (MCPP) analysis in these two syndromes and identified distinct and different pattern profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This illustrates that the MCPPs are specific in these syndromes, even at an early age, and not related solely to the unusually <z:hpo ids='HP_0010493'>long metacarpals</z:hpo> and phalanges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this study we used data from 50 Sotos patients (34 from the United Kingdom and 16 from the Netherlands, with a total of 95 hand films) and 36 Marfan patients (from the Netherlands, with 98 hand films) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients over age 3 years the bone length (including the epiphysis) was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients under 7 1/2 years (29 Sotos and 12 Marfan) were also measured without inclusion of the epiphysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients measured without epiphysis had a relative <z:hpo ids='HP_0010049'>short metacarpal</z:hpo> 1 (MC1) and long distal phalanx 1 (DPh1) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175695" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Sotos syndrome</z:e>, and a relative long MC1 and short DPh1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Between age 3 and 7 1/2 years more than 90% of the films could be classified correctly using these two variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the roentgenograms measured with epiphyses, about 80% were classified correctly </plain></SENT>
