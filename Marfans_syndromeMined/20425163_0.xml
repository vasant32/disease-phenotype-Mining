<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although there are many clinical manifestations of this disease, the most life threatening are cardiovascular complications, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> and aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When the primary defect was discovered in the fibrillin-1 gene, it was hypothesized that mutations in fibrillin-1 resulted in a weakened and disordered elastic architecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, recent evidence has suggested that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is caused by more than just a disordered microfibril matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interest was stimulated when it was discovered that fibrillin-1 mutations enhanced the release of sequestered latent transforming growth factor-beta, a well-described mediator of vascular remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This article focuses on the pathophysiology of aortopathy in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and related diseases, with special emphasis on the role of transforming growth factor-beta in mediating the pathogenesis of this disease </plain></SENT>
