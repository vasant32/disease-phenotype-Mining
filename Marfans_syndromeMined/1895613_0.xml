<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first two cases using an SJM aortic valve prosthesis and <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53251">Teflon</z:chebi> felt-pledgeted mattress sutures for the proximal anastomoses required a coronary bypass graft from the tube graft to the anterior descending coronary artery because of difficulty in completing the graft-left coronary ostial anastomoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the subsequent seven cases, an SJM mitral valve prosthesis with a large, soft cuff for a valved conduit was sewn in reverse and a thin wall <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53251">Teflon</z:chebi> roll was used for the <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53251">Teflon</z:chebi> felt of the pledgeted mattress suture in the proximal anastomoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a result, anastomoses between the tube graft and coronary ostia were performed easily and successfully in eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One case with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> required reoperation nine years after the first operation for recurrence of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the need for careful and continued follow-up is important in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
