<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The latter, in its <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, shows no opacification of the false lumen through medical imagings such as computed tomography (CT) scans or angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the pathoclinical features of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over a period of 14 years, a study was conducted of 371 patients who were classified as O type and 95 who were classified as T type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age was significantly higher in T-type patients and the sex ratio showed a significantly higher proportion of males </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> was 11%, and was not observed in T-type patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 18 T-type patients (19%), complications such as cerebral ischemic episodes were observed </plain></SENT>
