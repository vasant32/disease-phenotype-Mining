<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At autopsy the only significant finding was a floppy aortic valve (FAV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histologic, histochemical and electron microscopic studies corroborated the macroscopic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previously described associations of the FAV include the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026267" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PMV">floppy mitral valve</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> and aortic cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of these features were found in the present case which is the first recorded example of isolated FAV presenting as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is obscure, and while it is presumed to be dysrhythmic, a detailed histological examination of the cardiac conducting system revealed no anatomic abnormality </plain></SENT>
