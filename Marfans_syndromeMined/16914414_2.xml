<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: From October 2001 to March 2005, 25 patients underwent aortic root replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, the indication for surgery was a degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with a diameter of more than 6 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had undergone a previous aortic operation on the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 53+/-13 years and 22 patients were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean Euroscore was 5.2+/-2.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>Aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 30-day mortality was 0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients required profound hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean aortic cross-clamp time was 91+/-24 minutes and the mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> time was 24+/-15 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No patients developed a pseudoaneurysm after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that composite aortic root replacement with the classic or modified Cabrol technique results in a low operative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, it should be only used when a "button" technique is not feasible </plain></SENT>
