<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the role of nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMR) in this syndrome, 10 patients were evaluated using a 0.35 tesla commercial nuclear magnetic resonance imaging system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Findings from these studies were compared with data from other noninvasive tests as well as surgical follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results from these examinations indicate that NMR-derived measurements of aortic root diameter agree closely with echocardiographic measurements </plain></SENT>
