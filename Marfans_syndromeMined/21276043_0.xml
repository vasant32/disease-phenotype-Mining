<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aim to describe the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> as a case-example of how pharmacological and genomic insights can contribute to improved therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We undertook a literature search for studies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, to identify milestones in description, understanding and therapy of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From the studies retrieved we then weaved an evidence-based description of progress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> shows considerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in clinical presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It relies on defined clinical criteria with confirmation based on FBN1 mutation testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgical advances have prolonged life in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>First-line prophylaxis of complications with β-adrenoceptor blockers became established on the basis that reduction of aortic pressure and heart rate would help </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Over-activity of proteinases, first suggested in 1980, has since been confirmed by evidence of over-expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), notably MMP-2 and MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The search for MMP inhibitors led to the evaluation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi>, and both animal studies and small trials, provided early evidence that this widely used <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33281">antimicrobial agent</z:chebi> was useful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Identification of the importance of TGF-β led to evaluation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> type I receptor (AT(1) R) blockers with highly promising results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Combination prophylactic therapy would appear rational </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological and genomic research has provided good evidence that therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi> would prevent the aortic complications of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>If on-going well designed trials confirm their efficacy, the outlook for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> patients would be improved considerably </plain></SENT>
