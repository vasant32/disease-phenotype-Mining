<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1986 and 2007, 23 children (less than 16 years of age, mean age: 8.1+/-5.1 years) underwent elective aortic root replacement for aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (with associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> in 10 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had connective tissue defect syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine patients underwent composite valve graft repair using a mechanical valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fourteen children underwent valve-sparing aortic root replacement (remodeling procedure in 11, reimplantation procedure in 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up (100% complete) was 7.3+/-5.5 years (range 6 months-21 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was one early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (4.3%)(after valve-sparing remodeling) and no late mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following valve-sparing remodeling operation (10 patients, mean follow-up: 7.8+/-3.0 years), there were 9 reoperations in 6 patients and only 5 patients retained their native aortic valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients who underwent valve-sparing reimplantation operation (three patients, mean follow-up: 2.1+/-0.3 years), one underwent reoperation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients had composite valve graft replacement either as a primary operation (nine cases) or at reoperation for valve-sparing failure (six cases); mean follow-up was 8.2+/-6.2 years; there was no thrombo-embolic or hemorrhagic event and one reoperation for patient-prosthesis mismatch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: (1) composite valve graft aortic root replacement provides excellent long-term results in children with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This remains the first choice procedure in patients with more than minimal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo>, with distorted aortic leaflets or needing concomitant mitral valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>(2) Valve-sparing remodeling surgery yields disappointing results and should probably be abandoned in the pediatric population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>(3) Valve-sparing reimplantation repair may achieve superior outcome but needs further evaluation </plain></SENT>
