<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is the diagnostic imaging procedure of choice in the unstable patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hallmarks of dissection are the presence of an intimal membrane, or flap, dividing a true and a false lumen, entry and reentry tears, periaortic <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> or tamponade, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> in dissection of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TEE allows detection of involvement of the ascending aorta, which places the patient in an extremely high-risk group and necessitates urgent operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of TEE is similar to computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, with the added benefit of being feasible at the bedside or in the operating room </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Precautions have to be taken during TEE to avoid an abrupt rise in blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aortic intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> is often a precursor of classic dissection or accompanies it and can also be diagnosed by TEE, although the diagnosis is frequently difficult </plain></SENT>
