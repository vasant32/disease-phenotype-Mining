<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the patients was 32.9 +/- 9.3 years (women 32.5 +/- 9.7, men 33.4 +/- 8.6), mean height was 180.3 +/- 10.3 cm (women 176.3 +/- 9.2, men 188.1 +/- 7.5) and mean body mass index 20.9 +/- 3.6 kg/m(2) (women 20.8 +/- 3.4, men 20.95 +/- 3.97) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BMD values in the 60 patients were as follows: Z-score of the hip, -1.26 +/- 0.93, p&lt;10(-9) (neck, -0.93 +/- 1.09, p&lt;10(-9); trochanter, -1.31 +/- 0.85, p&lt;10(-9); intertrochanter, -1.39 +/- 0.99, p&lt;10(-9); Ward's triangle, -0.93 +/- 1.88, p&lt;10(-9)); Z-score of the radius: -1.6 +/- 1.06, p&lt;10(-9) (1/3 proximal, -1.29 +/- 1.03; mid-radius, -1.94 +/- 1.04; ultradistal, -0.68 +/- 1.1, p&lt;10(-9)) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>BMD in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients was significantly decreased at cortical compared with trabecular sites (radius 1/3 proximal vs ultradistal, p&lt;0.0001; total femur vs Ward's triangle, p&lt;0.0005) </plain></SENT>
