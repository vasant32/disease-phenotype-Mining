<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Interstitial deletions involving the 15q21.1 band are very rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only 4 of these cases have been studied using molecular cytogenetic techniques in order to confirm the deletion of the whole FBN1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of clinical features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) spectrum associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> has been described in only 2/4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we report on a 16-year-old female referred for suspicion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> (positive thumb and wrist sign, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, joint hyperlaxity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000156'>high-arched palate</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000678'>dental crowding</z:hpo>, dysmorphism, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral insufficiency</z:hpo> with dystrophic valve, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001065'>striae</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She had therefore 3 minor criteria according to the Ghent nosology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She also had speech disabilities but could follow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> school training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing of the FBN1, TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 genes was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MLPA revealed a genomic deletion of the whole FBN1 gene, confirmed by loss of heterozygosity of maternal alleles for several microsatellite markers surrounding the FBN1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The deletion was confirmed by FISH using a FBN1 probe and was not found in the parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Array-CGH permitted to define a 2.97 Mb deletion, which was the smallest 15q microdeletion including FBN1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Contrary to the other published observations, our proband does not exhibit <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>, but neuropsychological evaluations revealed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0007018'>attention deficit</z:hpo> as well as a deficit in information-processing speed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Haploinsufficiency of FBN1 is likely to contribute to the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, attenuated features could be explained because disturbances of TGF-beta signalling associated with FBN1 mutations do not exert full phenotypic effect through simple haploinsufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>Phenotypic variability</z:hpo> in other patients with interstitial deletions including 15q21.1 band may reflect differences in deletion size and/or cys/trans modifying factors </plain></SENT>
