<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate whether total arch replacement (TAR) during initial surgery for root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> should be routinely performed in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 94 consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients fulfilling Ghent criteria who underwent 148 aortic surgeries and were followed at this institution during the past 16 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean follow-up interval was 8.8 Â± 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initial presentation was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (AAD) in 35% of patients (76% Type A and 24% Type B) and aneurismal disease in 65% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TAR was performed in 8% of patients during initial surgery for AAD (otherwise a hemi-arch replacement was performed) and 1.6% in elective root repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary TAR had to be performed in only 3% of patients without, but in 33% following AAD (33% Type A and 33% Type B; P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-day, 6-month, 1-year and overall mortalities were 3.2, 5.3, 6.4 and 11.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Operative and 30-day mortalities in secondary aortic arch replacement were zero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Secondary TAR after AAD did not increase the need for the replacement of the entire thoracoabdominal aorta during follow-up compared with patients without secondary TAR (37 vs 40%, P = 1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients undergoing elective root repair have small risk of reinterventions on the aortic arch, and primary prophylactic replacement does not seem to be justified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with AAD, the need for reinterventions is precipitated by the dissection itself and not by limiting the procedure to the hemi-arch replacement in the emergency setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Limiting surgery to the aortic root, ascending aorta and proximal aortic arch is associated with low mortality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients presenting with AAD </plain></SENT>
