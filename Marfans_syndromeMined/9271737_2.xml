<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Our current approach to aortic root disease in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is replacement with a composite valve graft, a technique with established excellent early and long-term results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this report is to retrospectively review our results with aortic root replacement in Marfan patients and to discuss the status of several alternative techniques, chiefly aimed at eliminating the need for a mechanical valve, that are currently under investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, we perform aortic root replacement for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004933'>ascending aortic dissections</z:hpo> and significant annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> or aortic valvular insufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reserve concomitant mitral valve surgery for those patients with clinically significant regurgitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From February 1991 through July 1996, 45 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> underwent aortic root replacement; 44 of the patients (97.8%) had composite valve grafts placed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (28.9%) required concomitant graft replacement of the transverse aortic arch and four patients (8.9%) underwent concurrent mitral valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, two early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (4.4%), and no postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patient has developed evidence of an anastomotic pseudoaneurysm nor graft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Composite valve graft replacement of the aortic root carries low morbidity and mortality, produces excellent long-term results, and currently remains the treatment of choice for proximal dissection or significant annulo-aortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Alternative techniques are evolving; however, further long-term data demonstrating durability that compares favorably to established techniques will be required before recommending their routine use </plain></SENT>
