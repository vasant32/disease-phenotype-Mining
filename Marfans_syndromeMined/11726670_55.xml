<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Proteolytic digestion of tissues has been utilized to release microfibrils for study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Few of the molecules that connect microfibrils to other elements in the matrix have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, electron microscopic immunolocalization of anti-versican antibodies in tissues and in extracted microfibrils demonstrated that the C-terminal region of versican is found associated with fibrillin microfibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Extraction of microfibrils followed by treatment of microfibrils under dissociating conditions suggested that the versican C terminus is covalently bound to microfibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Binding assays using recombinant fibrillin-1 polypeptides and recombinant lectican lectin domains indicated that the versican lectin domain binds to specific fibrillin-1 polypeptides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The versican lectin domain also bound to molecules comigrating with authentic fibrillin-1 monomers in an assay using cell culture medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In assays using microfibrils, the versican lectin domain demonstrated preferential binding compared with other lecticans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Binding was calcium-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The binding site for versican in microfibrils is most likely within a region of fibrillin-1 between calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like domains 11 and 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Human mutations in this region can result in severe forms of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> ("neonatal" <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The connection between versican and fibrillin microfibrils may be functionally significant, particularly in cardiovascular tissues </plain></SENT>
