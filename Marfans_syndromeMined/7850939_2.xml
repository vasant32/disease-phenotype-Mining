<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Aneurysmal dilation of the aorta with subsequent rupture or dissection occurs frequently in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and is the primary cause of morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These complications are related to the altered composition and disorganized structure of the aortic media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to use high-frequency ultrasonic tissue characterization to identify these structural changes in abnormal aorta from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured integrated backscatter and anisotropy of backscatter of ultrasound from specimens of aorta from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> undergoing aortic root replacement and compared these values with those from aortic specimens of patients without clinical aortic pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Aortic tissue was obtained at the time of surgery from 11 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> undergoing repair of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> or dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> tissue was obtained at the time of autopsy from 8 patients without evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Acoustic microscopy at 50 MHz was performed to measure integrated backscatter from each specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of ultrasonic anisotropy of backscatter for each tissue type was determined as an index of the three-dimensional (3D) organization of the vessel matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The collagen content of each specimen was determined with a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18095">hydroxyproline</z:chebi> assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Marfan aortas exhibited less backscatter than did <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aortas (-40.9 +/- 2.9 versus -32.6 +/- 2.2 dB for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and healthy subjects, respectively, P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in collagen concentrations was observed between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and Marfan aorta (262.7 +/- 52.7 versus 282.4 +/- 41.8 mg/g tissue for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and Marfan aortas, respectively, P = .42), despite the large difference in backscatter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Histological analysis revealed striking differences in both the amount and organization of the elastin in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> segments from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> aorta was characterized by well-formed elastin fibers arranged in a lamellar pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The media from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in Marfan aorta exhibited a profound decrease in elastin content that was associated with loss of the highly aligned and ordered lamellar arrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The directional dependence of scattering, or ultrasonic anisotropy, also differed dramatically between the two tissue types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Backscatter from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aorta decreased substantially when the media was insonified parallel compared with perpendicular to the principal axis of the elastin fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Marfan aorta exhibited a much smaller directional dependence of scattering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> aortas manifested a 14-fold greater ultrasonic anisotropy than did Marfan aortas (24.1 +/- 3.7 versus 12.4 +/- 3.3 dB for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and Marfan aortas, P &lt; .0001), which is indicative of the profound extent of matrix disorganization in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data show that high-frequency ultrasonic tissue characterization sensitively detects changes in vessel wall composition and organization that occur in the aorta of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Aortic segments from these patients manifested a significant decrease in integrated backscatter compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aorta (approximately 8 dB, or greater than a 6-fold decrease in scattering) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>A 15-fold reduction in the ultrasonic anisotropy of Marfan tissue was observed, which suggests a marked disorganization of the 3D architecture of these aortas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>These data support the hypothesis that high-frequency ultrasonic tissue characterization may be useful for identifying abnormalities of vessel wall composition, architecture, and material properties </plain></SENT>
