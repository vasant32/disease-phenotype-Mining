<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin-rich microfibrils are long extracellular matrix fibrillar components exhibiting a 50 nm periodic beaded-structure with a width of around 20-25 nm after rotary shadowing and a 10-12 nm diameter when observed in ultra-thin sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They are composed of fibrillin monomers more or less associated with many other components which are, for the most part, poorly characterized up to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They are known to be elastic but few data have been accumulated to understand their properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Atomic force microscopy (AFM) allowed us to morphologically differentiate fibrillin-rich microfibrils from other fibrillar components and to investigate the thin structure of these beaded filaments in their native state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They showed, in AFM, a periodic beaded structure ranging from 50 to 60 nm and a width of about 40 nm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The different sizes of fibrillin-containing microfibrils previously observed after rotary shadowing and in ultra-thin sections was resolved with our technique and is revealed to be 10 nm in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Each beaded microfibril appears to be composed of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> beads connected by 2-3 arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An orientation of the microfibrils has been shown, and allows us to propose a complementary model of microfibrillar monomer association </plain></SENT>
