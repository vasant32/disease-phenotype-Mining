<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Reimplantation of the native, structurally intact aortic valve within a Dacron tube graft in patients with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> corrects annular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the sinotubular junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The durability of this valve repair with respect to the increased mechanical stress on valve cusps has been discussed, is quite controversial, and is yet unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: From July 1993 to November 1998, a replacement of the ascending aorta with a repair of the aortic valve was performed in 75 patients (53 men and 22 women aged 50+/-19 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients (28%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and 11 patients (15%) had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, type Stanford A (6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 17 patients (23%), concomitant replacement of the aortic arch was necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical and echocardiographic follow-up was performed in 6- to 12-month intervals for a cumulative study period of 137 patient-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients (3%) died 5 and 20 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One additional patient experienced a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> within the first postoperative week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients (4%) with progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> required aortic valve replacement after 9, 11, and 14 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other patients had no or mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The repairs have now remained stable for &lt;/=65 months (mean, 22+/-20 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Other valve-related complications did not occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that this type of aortic valve repair achieves excellent results in selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Perfect coaptation of valve cusps during the repair with no or only trace <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> at initial echocardiography seems to be essential for durability </plain></SENT>
