<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present editorial, besides providing a historical review, offers a succinct definition and a new classification and terminology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is hoped that this or a similar classification would clarify some of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> surrounding the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The current echocardiographic criteria are reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some difficulty in the diagnosis of milder forms of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> is inevitable because a distinction between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bulging and excessive hooding may be subtle in such cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proposed criteria using multiple echocardiographic cross sections (rather than the long-axis view alone) is more likely to provide a comprehensive visualization of several components of the leaflets and avoid errors of underdiagnosis of localized myxomatous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The criteria and discussion are based on the author's experience and interest in the diagnosis of this condition and clinical correlations with intraoperative findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If the cardiac surgeons and the echocardiologists could agree on a common terminology and classification scheme, it could result in better anatomic correlations of the echocardiographic findings in this condition and potentially result in improved patient care </plain></SENT>
