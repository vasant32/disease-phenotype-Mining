<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mathematical models can be used to assess the relative importance of increased wall stresses and decreased strength in these mechanical failures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To obtain needed inputs for such models, mechanical properties of dilated human ascending aorta were measured in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specimens for opening angle, biaxial elastic, and uniaxial circumferential strength tests were cut from excised tissue obtained from 54 patients (age 18-81 years) undergoing elective aortic graft replacement surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Opening angle was significantly greater in patients older than 50 years (262 degrees + 76 degrees, n = 21) compared to younger patients (202 degrees +/- 70 degrees, n = 13) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rapid increases in circumferential and axial stresses occurred at lower strains in the older patient group than in the younger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean strength was significantly lower in older patients (1.35 +/- 0.37 MPa, n= 14) than younger (2.04 +/- 0.46 MPa, n = 11, age &lt;50 years) </plain></SENT>
