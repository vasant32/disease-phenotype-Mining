<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 were upregulated during progression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, accompanied with degenerated elastic fibers and vasomotor dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi>, a nonspecific inhibitor of MMPs, would ameliorate <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> by attenuating elastic fiber degeneration and improving vasomotor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A well-characterized mouse model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (Fbn1(C1039G/+)) was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice were untreated (n=40), given <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi> (0.24 g/L, n=30), or given atenolol (0.5 g/L, n=30) in drinking water at 6 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Fbn1(+/+) mice served as control (n=40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 3, 6, and 9 months, aortic segments from the ascending, arch, and descending portions were used to obtain the "average" value of the whole thoracic aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> was prevented in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi> group, whereas mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was evident in the atenolol group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">Doxycycline</z:chebi> improved elastic fiber integrity, normalized aortic stiffness, and prevented vessel weakening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The impairment of vasocontraction and endothelium-dependent relaxation in the untreated and atenolol groups were improved by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The upregulation of transforming growth factor-beta in the Marfan aorta was suppressed by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">Doxycycline</z:chebi> augmented expression ratios of tissue inhibitors of MMP to MMPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Intraperitoneally injected neutralizing antibodies against MMP-2 and -9 yielded similar effects to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We concluded that long-term treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi>, through the inhibition of MMP-2 and -9, is more effective than atenolol in preventing <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> by preserving elastic fiber integrity, normalizing vasomotor function, and reducing transforming growth factor-beta activation </plain></SENT>
