<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Artisan aphakic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOLs</z:e> were implanted in 18 eyes of 11 children with subluxated lenses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Idiopathic subluxations and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> were included, whereas subluxations due to trauma or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000557'>buphthalmos</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and endothelial cell density were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean postoperative BCVA and endothelial cell density at last follow-up visit were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age of children at the time of Artisan aphakic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e> implantation ranged from 8 to 16 years (mean: 11.58 ± 2.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 9.12 ± 4.30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean postoperative logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution BCVA was 0.26 ± 0.13 (P = .001) and mean postoperative endothelial cell density was 2,860 ± 435 cells/mm(2) (P = .000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean endothelial cell loss was 17.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Artisan aphakic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e> implantation is a safe surgical choice in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> in the pediatric age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It has minimal complications and is less traumatic to pediatric eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, long-term follow-up of these children is required.[J Pediatr Ophthalmol <z:hpo ids='HP_0000486'>Strabismus</z:hpo> 2013;50(3):178-182.] </plain></SENT>
