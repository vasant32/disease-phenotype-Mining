<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In presence of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> the rate of collagen synthesis was 2-2.4-fold lower that in corresponding controls both in proliferating and stationary cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the same time, relative synthesis of collagen was quite similar both in the patient and control fibroblasts in presence of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
