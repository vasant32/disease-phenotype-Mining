<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute established the first phase of its national GenTAC Registry in 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ENROLLMENT AND DIAGNOSES: Between 2007 and 2010, 6 enrolling centers established the GenTAC I Registry consisting of 2,046 patients (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> 576 [28.2%], <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> disease 504 [24.6%], <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> or dissection age &lt;50 years 369 [18%], and others) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biologic samples for DNA analyses (white blood cells or saliva) are available in 97%, and stored plasma is available in 60% of enrollees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Initial scientific inquiry using the GenTAC Registry has included validation studies of genetic causes for aortic syndromes, potential usefulness of transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) blood levels in Marfan subjects, and current surgical approaches to ascending aortic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FUTURE OPPORTUNITY: The second phase of GenTAC will allow biannual follow-up of GenTAC I enrollees for up to 9 years, enrollment of an additional 1,500 subjects, further integration of imaging findings with clinical and genetic data through utilization of an imaging core laboratory, important validation of phenotype-genotype correlations through a phenotyping core laboratory, and integration of a scientific advisory committee to help define the full range and depth of the Registry's scientific capabilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The registry resources are available to the external scientific community through an application process accessible at https://gentac.rti.org </plain></SENT>
