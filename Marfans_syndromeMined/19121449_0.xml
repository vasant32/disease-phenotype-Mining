<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are no published data comparing <z:mp ids='MP_0010574'>aortic dilation</z:mp> in children with <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp> with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001680'>aortic coarctation</z:hpo> (CoA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to (1) compare differences in aortic dimensions and rates of dilation between children with isolated <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp> with those of children with <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp> and CoA and (2) identify risk factors for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0010574'>aortic dilation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp> with CoA (group A) and without CoA (group B) were identified from our echocardiographic database (1993 to 2006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aortic measurements at 4 levels were obtained, and z scores were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Criteria for exclusion were severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>/stenosis, previous aortic valvuloplasty, complex left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defects</z:hpo>, and Turner, Noonan, Williams, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 600 echocardiograms in 247 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group A had 192 echocardiograms in 53 patients (median age 11.3 years; range 0 to 30; median follow-up 7 years), and group B had 382 in 194 patients (median age 8.7 years; range 0 to 29; median follow-up 4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Group B had significantly greater ascending aorta dimensions (p&lt;0.05) and significantly faster rates of <z:mp ids='MP_0010574'>aortic dilation</z:mp> (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ascending aorta in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp> and CoA did not dilate to the same degree as in patients with isolated <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, valve morphologic characteristics and function and age at CoA repair had none to minimal impact on aortic dimensions </plain></SENT>
