<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a boy with low expression of HLA class I molecules on peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient, who had a Marfan-like phenotype, had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0200042'>skin ulcers</z:hpo> and sinobronchiectasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistologic examination of the ulcerated skin showed a dense perivascular infiltrate composed of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mature lymphocytes and macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cells in the infiltrate showed an apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> expression of HLA class I molecules, but intraepidermal dendritic Langerhans' cells were negative for CD1a, an antigen that is a highly specific marker for these cells and is abundantly expressed in some self-healing forms of cutaneous lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is therefore speculated that a defective expression of CD1a molecules can contribute to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> persistence of deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0200042'>skin ulcers</z:hpo>, which have already been reported in association with defective expression of HLA class I molecules </plain></SENT>
