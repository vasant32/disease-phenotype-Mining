<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection (AAD) surgery in the Netherlands are largely unknown, as was recently stated in a report by the Health Council of the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to gain more insight into the Dutch situation we investigated predictors of in-hospital mortality of surgically treated AAD patients and assessed threeyear survival.Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>104 consecutive patients undergoing surgery for AAD in a 16-year period (1990-2006) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative and intraoperative variables were analysed to identify predictors of early mortality.Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preoperative malperfusion (limb <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920157" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mesenteric ischaemia</z:e>) was present in 15.4%, shock in 18.3%, and 6.7% were operated under cardiac massage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> was present in four patients and four patients had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In-hospital mortality was 22.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven patients died intraoperatively; other causes of inhospital mortality were major brain damage in ten patients, multiple organ failure in three patients, low cardiac output in two patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression revealed preoperative malperfusion (p=0.004) to be the only independent predictor of in-hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three-year survival was 68.8+/-4.7% (including hospital mortality) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hospital survivors had a three-year survival of 88.3+/-3.9%.Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In-hospital mortality of our patients (22.1%) is comparable with the results of larger case series published in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Prognosis after successful surgical treatment is relatively good with a three-year survival of 88.3% in our series </plain></SENT>
