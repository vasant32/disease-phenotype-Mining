<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether left ventricular dysfunction is present in these patients is not clear at present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Assess left ventricular function in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, free of significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo>, using a combination of MRI and Tissue Doppler imaging (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 26 Marfan patients (mean age=32.0+/-10.9, 12 men) without significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo>, and 26 age- and sex-matched controls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction were measured with magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Systolic and diastolic function parameters were assessed using conventional echocardiography and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When compared to controls, Marfan patients showed impairment of left ventricular contractile function as expressed by a reduced ejection fraction (53.5+/-9.0% vs. 59.6+/-6.7%, p=0.009), an increased end-systolic volume (36.0+/-9.5 vs. 29.5+/-6.7 ml/m(2), p=0.007), and reduced peak systolic velocities at the basal septal and lateral myocardial wall (5.2+/-1.4 vs. 6.4+/-1.3 cm/s, p=0.003 and 6.0+/-2.2 vs. 7.5+/-2.3 cm/s, p=0.03, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diastolic function was impaired with an increased deceleration time of the E wave (171+/-41 ms vs. 141+/-36 ms, p=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Peak early diastolic velocity at the mitral valve annulus was significantly lower (9.6+/-2.4 cm/s vs. 11.9+/-3.3 cm/s, p=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data provide evidence for mild, but significant impairment of left ventricular systolic and diastolic function in Marfan patients, not related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
