<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 403 ascending and aortic arch operations, 68 patients underwent minimally invasive aortic surgery including 23 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, 5 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, 29 reoperations, and 39 with hypothermic arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood conservation methods were used in 187 of the 403 patients (46.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aortic valve procedures were used in 267 (66.2%), including 51 (12.7%) valve-preserving operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A protocol for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and neurocognitive deficit prevention was used in an attempt to prevent neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were prospectively collected and included new neurocognitive events either by formal testing (n = 35) or by informal questioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> occurred in 2.0% (8 of 403); clinical gross neurocognitive deficits in 2.5% (10 of 403) with a 98% 30-day survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For those patients undergoing the minimally invasive operation 1 hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred (98.5% survival) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Homologous operative transfusions were required in only 12% of blood conservation patients (23 of 187) and their postoperative intubation time, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and hospital stay were significantly shorter (p &lt; 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive surgery is particularly useful for reoperations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The blood conservation methods appear to be beneficial and the number of neurologic deficits is low with the current protocol </plain></SENT>
