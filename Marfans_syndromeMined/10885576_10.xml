<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SVAS is associated with haploinsufficiency of elastin, one of the two major components of the elastic fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SVAS is characterized by narrowing of the arterial lumen due to the failure of regulation of cellular proliferation and matrix deposition </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin-1 is the building block of the microfibrils that span the entire thickness of the aortic wall and are a major component of the elastic fibers that reside in the medial layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The vascular hallmark of EDS IV is rupture of large vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The phenotype is caused by mutations in type III collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mutations ultimately affect the overall architecture of the collagenous network and the biomechanical properties of the adventitial layer of the vessel wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Altogether, these genotype-phenotype correlations document the diversified contributions of distinct extracellular macroaggregates to the assembly and function of the vascular matrix </plain></SENT>
