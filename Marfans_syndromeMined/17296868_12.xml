<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It was only approximately 15 years ago that methodologies evolved to the point where we began to manipulate the genetic apparatus of the mouse such that proteins of the investigator's choice could be expressed in a 4-chambered, mammalian heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our abilities to express both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and mutated proteins in the heart or to create genetic nulls in which the protein is not expressed at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> continue to evolve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the tools now available, one can target protein expression to the different cell types present in the heart, often at a particular time, and, in some cases, turn off the protein as development progresses or the animal ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These abilities have enabled us to model many of the genetic mutations identified as causative for pediatric and/or adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Identifying the primary genetic cause is, more often than not, insufficient for designing effective therapeutics or interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is critical to be able to develop animal models that accurately recapitulate the pathogenic processes that ensue as a result of mutant gene expression or loss of protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this review, we discuss the nature, strengths, and weaknesses of the current set of tools for developing genetically manipulated mouse models, as well as the relevance of these models for understanding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and illuminating potential therapeutic avenues </plain></SENT>
