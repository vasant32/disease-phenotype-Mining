<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>Ectopia lentis</z:hpo> (EL) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) are considered two distinct clinical entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed genetic and clinical studies to investigate whether EL is actually distinct from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> or if it is a mild phenotypic expression of it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven patients with EL were followed for 5-10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutation screening analysis of the 65 exons of FBN1 was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of genomic DNA, denaturing high pressure liquid chromatography analysis, and direct sequencing of heteroduplexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Yearly examinations during the 10 years of follow-up allowed the detection of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> in six out of seven patients (age range: 32-64 years versus 8-55 years in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> previously reported) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also detected the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of mild thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> case (age 45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six out of seven index cases of EL turned out to be mild forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> with possible late cardiovascular involvement as detected in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four novel missense mutations and one known splicing mutation were detected in five out of seven (71%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Their localization confirmed the presence of a first hot spot within exons 1-15 and suggested the presence of a second one between exons 31-39 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a second major criterion in six EL patients shifted the clinical diagnosis from EL to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that some cases, which are initially diagnosed as EL, turn out to be mild Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A clinical cardiovascular follow-up is therefore highly recommended for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EL patients since they may develop thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi>) or dissection later in life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Also magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> (DE) should be performed in a complete follow up for a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
