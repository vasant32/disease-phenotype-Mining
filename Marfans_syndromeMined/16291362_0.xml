<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the accuracy and precision of 2 height-prediction methods in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and to assess the growth-reductive effect and side effects of <z:chebi fb="25" ids="50112">sex hormone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: In a retrospective study in 31 untreated (17 boys) and 43 treated patients (21 boys) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, we assessed bone age and predicted adult height by 2 methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of the methods was assessed in the untreated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of therapy was corrected for outcome in the untreated group and other confounding variables with multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Accuracy strongly varied with sex, chronological age, and prediction method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall precision was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment was started at a mean age of 12.8 +/- 1.4 years (boys) and 11.4 +/- 1.2 years (girls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With multiple regression analysis, a statistically significant effect was observed only in boys using a pharmacologic dosage (5.5 cm, 95% CI 0.96-10.1 cm; P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Side effects were worsening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001061'>acne</z:hpo> and weight and muscle gain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In adolescents with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, the accuracy and precision of 2 height-prediction methods were limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The apparent growth-reductive effect of <z:chebi fb="25" ids="50112">sex hormone</z:chebi> treatment appears similar to earlier reports on adolescents with constitutional <z:hpo ids='HP_0000098'>tall stature</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no clinically important short-term side effects </plain></SENT>
