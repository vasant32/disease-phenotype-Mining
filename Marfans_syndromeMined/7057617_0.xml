<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We reviewed 22 consecutive patients undergoing surgery during 13 years from 1968 to 1981 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> due primarily to idiopathic medionecrosis resulting in annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> was accompanied in 45% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The operative period was divided into 2 stages, the first from 1968 to 1976, and the second from 1977 to 1981 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the earlier period, the operative mortality was 42%, and it improved significantly to 0% (p less than 0.05) in the later period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reasons for improved surgical results are 1) the employment of the Bentall operation with some technical modifications and 2) the use of better myocardial protection method with cold <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> cardioplegia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The postoperative hemodynamic and clinical improvements were significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The left ventricular improved toward <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Operative survivors showed a clinical improvement from NYHA class 3 to 1.3 on an average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival rate at 6 years after operation was 64.3% in the entire series, and 71.1% in patients with the Bentall operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with type I <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, a false lumen remained patent after operation and may progress to cause late morbidity or mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Surgery should be performed earlier than <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> takes place whenever feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The Bentall operation can now be performed with a low risk, and can improve the clinical and hemodynamic states and very possibly prolong the longevity of the patients </plain></SENT>
