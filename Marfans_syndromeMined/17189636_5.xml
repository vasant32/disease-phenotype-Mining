<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>So far, more than 600 different mutations have been identified, accounting for 60-90% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> cases, the vast majority being single nucleotide exchanges as well as small deletions and insertions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only four major rearrangements have been described in the literature so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have screened 11 individuals fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> but negative for point mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene by SSCP and/or direct sequencing, for large rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report here the largest known de novo and out of frame deletion in the fibrillin-1 gene in a patient fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified the deletion breakpoints at the genomic and transcript levels and studied the expression of the mutated allele at the transcript and protein level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that large rearrangements may account for a non-negligible proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Marfan cases </plain></SENT>
