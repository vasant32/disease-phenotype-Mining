<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 38 autopsy cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, 6 (15.8%) had severe atherosclerotic changes, resembling those of PAU, at the site of entry (SE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinicopathological data on these patients were compared with those on 32 cases with nonatheromatous dissection (5 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> or its forme fruste and 27 without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>) and 13 with atherosclerotic saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For control study, the aorta of a 44-year-old woman who died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary cancer</z:e> was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compare to nonatheromatous dissection, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> were found in older women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four cases were complicated by saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SE was located in the ascending aorta in 1 and the descending aorta in 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These sites usually were ulcerated atheromatous plaques or longitudinal fissures rather than transverse tears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical examination of the SE revealed that MMP-1, 2, 9 and TIMP-2 were expressed in macrophages and/or interstitium, similar to the findings in atheromatous plaque or PAU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We propose that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> differs from the usual classical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with this lesion have a high risk of re-dissection from the new SE in the same lesion </plain></SENT>
