<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is caused by mutations in fibrillin1 (FBN1) gene resulting in activation of TGF-β, which developmentally regulates bone mass and matrix properties </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), we evaluated bone mineralization in 20 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> unselected for bone problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>z-Scores were calculated based on age, gender, height, and ethnicity matched controls </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean bone mineral density (BMD) z-score for whole body was -0.34±1.4 (P=0.29) and lumbar spine was reduced at -0.55±1.34 (P=0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On further adjusting for stature, which is usually higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, mean BMC z-score was reduced at -0.677±1.37 (P=0.04), mean BMD z-score for whole body was -0.82±1.55 (P=0.002) and for lumbar spine was -0.83±1.32 (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
