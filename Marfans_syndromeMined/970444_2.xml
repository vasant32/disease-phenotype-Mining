<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Striated membranous structures measured up to several microns in diameter, often were highly folded and convoluted, and sometimes appeared circular in outline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some SMS measured from 130 to 150 A in thickness and had indistinct edges and poorly defined periodicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority of SMS, however, had greater thicknesses, in the range of 200 A, and a periodicity characterized by alternating light and dark bands with a spacing that varied from 100 to 160 A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The structures were associated with thickened basement membranes, elastic fibers, and membrane-bound bodies of the type thought to be involved in elastogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Evidence available suggests that SMS results from an unusual pattern of arrangement of a component, possibly Type IV collagen, of basement membrane material </plain></SENT>
