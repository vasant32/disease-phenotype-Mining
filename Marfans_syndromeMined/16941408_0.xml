<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Long term results of four different operative procedures for the treatment of popliteal artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were investigated either performed by short venous or segmental alloplastic interpositions or long femoro-popliteal below the knee bypass using alloplastic grafts or autologous vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 47 patients treated for 50 popliteal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (mean diameter +/- SD: 3.5 +/- 1.1 cm) were analyzed (follow-up: 40.2 +/- 4.9 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Primary patency rate was 78% and secondary patency rate was 86% at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Frequency of operative reinterventions was higher in patients treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and in patients treated with alloplastic interpositions or alloplastic bypass (p = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary patency rates were higher in patients treated with autologous venous interpositions or venous femoro-popliteal bypass (p = 0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Times of secondary vascular patency were significantly shorter for patients treated with short alloplastic interpositions in comparison to long alloplastic femoro-popliteal bypass procedures, short venous interpositions or long venous bypass operations (p = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of patients with popliteal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> autologous venous interposition is therefore recommended or as an alternative venous or alloplastic femoro-popliteal below the knee bypass </plain></SENT>
