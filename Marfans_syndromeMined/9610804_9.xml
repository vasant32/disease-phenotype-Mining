<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We conducted a pilot study to evaluate the psychological effects and consequences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in 17 patients between 16 and 35 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Through a semi-structured interview, we investigated how the patients coped daily with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and evaluated the impact of the disease on specific items such as schooling, occupational choices, self-image, and social behaviour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A second part of the study consisted of a battery of standardised psychological tests to evaluate the patients' <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> levels and coping styles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following psychological tests were used: State and Trait <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> Inventory (STAI), Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Inventory (BDI), and the Utrecht Coping List (UCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The interviews showed that the disease represented a significant burden on the daily physical activities of the patients, as well as on their schooling and job opportunities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During childhood, most of them were insensitively teased by peers because of their typical phenotypic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This had its consequences on their social behaviour in that they are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> more introvert </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the female patients, the risk associated with child bearing represented a major concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most patients emphasised the need for accurate information about the illness immediately after knowing the diagnosis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> found psychological support helpful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> levels were higher in the female than in the male group, without being significantly different from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, most patients have come to terms with their disease and consider themselves happy most of the time </plain></SENT>
