<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The natural history of the residual aorta after repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> is incompletely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During a 22-year period, 201 patients underwent repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection by 25 surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For 168 operative survivors, mean late follow-up for reoperation or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 6.5 +/- 5.5 years and was 100% complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Late blood pressure and medication history were available for 136 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, 412 computed tomography scans were analyzed for segmental diameter and false lumen patency from 69 patients who underwent multiple follow-up imaging studies at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Freedom from reoperation at 10 years (range, 1 to 170 months) was 74% +/- 5% (28 reoperations in 26 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A nonresected primary tear (p = 0.05), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (p &lt; 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004421'>elevated systolic blood pressure</z:hpo> at follow-up (p = 0.008), and absence of beta-blocker therapy (p = 0.02) were independent predictors of late reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aortic growth between consecutive imaging studies was detected in 18% of intervals (62/343) affecting 49% patients (34/69), with mean yearly growth rate of 5.3 +/- 4.5 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>Onset</z:hpo> of enlargement was unpredictable and occurred 59 +/- 45 months postoperatively (range, 1 to 167 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for growth included aortic diameter (p &lt; 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004421'>elevated systolic blood pressure</z:hpo> (p = 0.04), and presence of a patent false lumen (p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Maximum aortic diameter of less than 35 mm predicted growth in 11% of intervals, 35 to 49 mm in 22%, and more than 49 mm in 37% (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Different proximal or distal surgical strategies did not affect aortic growth or need for reoperation (p &gt; 0.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Optimal long-term outcome of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection demands rigorous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> therapy and lifelong radiographic follow-up because aortic enlargement can begin more than a decade postoperatively </plain></SENT>
