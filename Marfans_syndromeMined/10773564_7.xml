<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the results of two operations, aortic valve-sparing and aortic root replacement, in patients with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of 78 consecutive patients with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> according to the Gent criteria indicated that 42 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aortic cusps had an aortic valve-sparing operation, and 36 patients had aortic root replacement (mechanical valve in 25 patients and biological valve in 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean age was similar in both groups, but patients who had aortic root replacement had larger <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, higher grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo>, worse left ventricular function and more cardiac co-morbidity than patients who had aortic valve-sparing operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 41+/-35 months for patients who had aortic valve-sparing, and 65+/-50 months for those who had aortic root replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Kaplan-Meyer estimates of survival at 5 years was 100% for patients who had aortic valve-sparing, and 88+/-6% for those who had aortic root replacement (P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients who had aortic root replacement required seven aortic root re-replacements: three for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> and four for valve failure (biological valves) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There have been no reoperations in patients who had aortic valve-sparing operations and annual Doppler echocardiography revealed mild or no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> in 39 patients and moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that aortic valve-sparing operations are safe in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and may provide better clinical outcomes than aortic root replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since the size of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> often determines the feasibility of a valve-sparing procedure, we now recommend surgery when the diameter of the aortic root reaches 50 mm in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who have echocardiographically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aortic valve cusps </plain></SENT>
