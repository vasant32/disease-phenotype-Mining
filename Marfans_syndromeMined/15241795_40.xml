<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to estimate the contribution of mutations at the fibrillin-1 locus (FBN1) to classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) and to study possible phenotypic differences between patients with an FBN1 mutation vs. without, a comprehensive molecular study of the FBN1 gene in a cohort of 93 MFS patients fulfilling the clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> according to the Ghent nosology was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The initial mutation screening by CSGE/SSCP allowed identification of an FBN1-mutation in 73 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Next, sequencing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> FBN1-exons was performed in 11 mutation-negative patients, while in nine others, DHPLC was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This allowed identification of seven and five additional mutations, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Southern blot analysis revealed an abnormal hybridization pattern in one more patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 23 out of the 85 mutations identified here are reported for the first time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic comparison of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients with cysteine-involving mutations vs. premature termination mutations revealed significant differences in ocular and skeletal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The phenotype of the eight patients without proven FBN1 mutation did not differ from the others with respect to the presence of major cardiac, ocular, and skeletal manifestations or positive familial history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most likely, a portion of FBN1-mutations remains undetected because of technical limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the involvement of the FBN1-gene could be demonstrated in at least 91% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients (85/93), which strongly suggests that this gene is the predominant, if not the sole, locus for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
