<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors describe a simplified and safer technique for surgical removal of hereditary or idiopathic soft subluxated lenses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five eyes of three patients underwent intercapsular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> of the lens material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A side-port cannula was introduced through the pars plicata while the eyes were pressurized by an anterior chamber maintainer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was followed by anterior vitrectomy and capsulectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With this technique, the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1398740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vitreous loss</z:e>, which can occur with an anterior approach, and the risk of the spread of lens particles into the vitreous, which can occur with a lensectomy with a vitrectomy probe, are avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, optical correction was achieved with a contact lens in the two children and with an anterior chamber intraocular lens in the adult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Final visual acuity was 6/9 or better in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No surgical or other complication occurred during 2 to 4 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A soft subluxated lens can be removed without the risks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1398740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vitreous loss</z:e> or spread of lens particles into the vitreous, reducing the probability of severe complications </plain></SENT>
