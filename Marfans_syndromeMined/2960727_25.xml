<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the feasibility of detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in a large group of young competitive athletes, a prospective screening evaluation of intercollegiate student athletes was undertaken at the University of Maryland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initial clinical screening (including personal and family history, physical examination and 12 lead electrocardiogram) was performed in 501 athletes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ninety of these subjects had positive findings on one or more of the three studies and agreed to further cardiologic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The vast majority (75 [84%] of 90) had no definitive evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, although 1 athlete had mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo> and 14 (15%) had echocardiographic evidence of relatively mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> that had not been previously suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In three athletes with relatively mild ventricular septal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> (14 to 15 mm), it was not possible to discern with absolute certainty whether the wall thickening was a manifestation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> or secondary to athletic conditioning ("athlete heart") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this screening protocol identified no athletes with definite evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> or other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> that convey a significant potential risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> or disease progression during athletic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This failure to identify such diseases could have been due to a lack of sensitivity of the screening tests or to the low frequency with which these diseases occur in youthful healthy athletes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A systematic preparticipation screening program (such as the present one) does not appear to be an efficient means of detecting clinically important <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in young athletes </plain></SENT>
