<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES AND BACKGROUND: Congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> is rare as an isolated lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe seven children with no physical features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in the patients or their families and no other cardiac lesions who had congenital valvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1954 to the present, seven children with auscultatory and physiologic characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> were evaluated for a total of 108 patient-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report on their natural history, clinical and laboratory findings, management and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In five of the seven children congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> was diagnosed in infancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In four, progressive severity of the regurgitation led to valve replacement at age 3, 10, 15 and 20 years, respectively, and to resection of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta in the 10-year old patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients had cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> on aortic biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of these patients died after reoperation for dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the thoracic aorta at 22 years of age; the other died after dissection and rupture of the ascending aorta at age 25 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After obstructing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155094,C0333350" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">pannus</z:e> developed, the 3-year old patient underwent replacement of the St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Jude valve at age 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The other three patients were asymptomatic at last follow-up at age 8, 10 and 20 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Supportive management is recommended until it becomes necessary to intervene surgically when regurgitation becomes severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The need for surgical treatment is indicated by the appearance of a diastolic thrill, left ventricular strain on the electrocardiogram or other evidence of left ventricular dysfunction on the echocardiogram or exercise stress testing by treadmill or radionuclide cineangiocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Close follow-up of these patients is important to detect progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, especially in the presence of cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
