<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis is based primarily on clinical involvement of these and other systems, referred to as the Ghent criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have identified three Hispanic families from Mexico with cardiovascular and ocular manifestations due to novel FBN1 mutations but with paucity of skeletal features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The largest family, hMFS001, had a frameshift mutation in exon 24 (3075delC) identified as the cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> in the family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Assessment of eight affected adults revealed no major skeletal manifestation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Family hMFS002 had a missense mutation (R1530C) in exon 37 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four members fulfilled the criteria for ocular and cardiovascular phenotype but lacked skeletal manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Family hMFS003 had two consecutive missense FBN1 mutations (C515W and R516G) in exon 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight members fulfilled the ocular criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and two members had major cardiovascular manifestations, however none of them met criteria for skeletal system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that individuals of Hispanic descent with FBN1 mutations may not manifest skeletal features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> to the same extent as Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We recommend that echocardiogram, ocular examination and FBN1 molecular testing be considered for any patients with possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> even in the absence of skeletal features, including Hispanic patients </plain></SENT>
