<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exposure of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was obtained with a thoracoabdominal incision by reflecting the abdominal viscera to the right </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First the limbs of a 24 X 12mm dacron bifurcated prosthesis were attached to common iliac arteries in an end-to-side fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then renal arteries were anastomosed end-to-end to the branches previously attached to the body of the prosthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the temporary bypass from left subclavian to left limb of the dacron graft, reconstruction of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">celiac</z:e> and superior mesenteric arteries was performed by direct suture of orifices to the opening made in the graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proximal anastomosis between descending aorta and the graft was made in an end-to-end fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The dissecting lesion of the proximal descending aorta was wrapped by dacron mesh </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The immediate postoperative course was uneventful except transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
