<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> is a life-threatening complication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> caused by mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>-mediated endothelial-dependent relaxation is impaired in the thoracic aorta in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we determined whether the cyclooxygenase (COX)-pathway is involved in the compromised aortic vasomotor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Thoracic aortae from mice at 3, 6 and 9 months of age, heterozygous for the Fbn1 allele encoding a cysteine substitution (Fbn1 (C1039G/+), 'Marfan', n=35), were compared with those from age-matched controls (n=35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: Isometric force measurement revealed that preincubation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi>, a non-specific COX inhibitor, but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27265">valeryl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30762">salicylate</z:chebi>, a specific COX-1 inhibitor, improved the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi>-induced contractions (at 6 months, EC(50) and E(max) were increased 4.5-fold and by 45%, respectively) in Marfan aortae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>-induced relaxation was improved 10-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blockade of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi>-endoperoxide receptor by SQ-29548 did not affect <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi>-mediated contractions in Marfan aortae, although they did respond to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> analogue, U46619 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From 6 months on, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi>-induced secretion of prostacyclin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> A(2) in Marfan aortae was 200% and 40%, respectively, of those in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reduced COX-1 expression was detected in Marfan aortae at 3 and 9 months, whilst COX-2 expression was increased from 3 months on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The compromised vasomotor function in Marfan thoracic aortae is associated with an imbalanced synthesis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> A(2) and prostacyclin resulting from the differential protein expression of COX-1 and COX-2 </plain></SENT>
