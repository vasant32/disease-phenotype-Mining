<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The fundamental defect leading to this disease has escaped definition despite decades of research efforts by several groups of investigators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Using linkage analyses with polymorphic markers of the human genome, we mapped the genetic defect to chromosome 15 in five families with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With three polymorphic markers we obtained definitive proof of linkage in these families (lod score = 3.92, theta = 0.0 +/- 0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most probable location of the gene for the disease is currently D15S45 (lod score = 3.32, theta = 0.0 +/- 0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The chromosomal localization of the mutation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is a first step toward the isolation and characterization of the defective gene and serves as a diagnostic test in families in which cosegregation of these markers with the disease has been confirmed </plain></SENT>
