<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: This study was undertaken to analyse the importance of the Metacarpal Index (MCI) in making the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The characteristics of 42 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> as defined by strict criteria were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one consecutive accident and emergency patients comprised the control group for the MCI measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using MCI alone four (7.8%) of controls had an abnormal MCI, and seven (16.6%) of Marfan patients were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two (76%) of Marfan patients had an abnormal MCI and three (13.4%) were equivocal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using other skeletal parameters (upper segment to lower segment ratio, arm span 3 cm or more greater than height, or palate, pectus or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> deformity) 40 (95%) of the Marfan group had an abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other parameters: 18 (43%) in the Marfan group gave a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic measurements showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> in 29 (69%) and in 21 (50%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> was found; 37 (88%) had one or other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormality</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parameters excluding MCI: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients would still have fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The role of the MCI, a radiation dependent and time consuming measurement, is probably insignificant in diagnosis of the majority of Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Combined with clinical measurements, an echocardiogram is probably the single most useful investigation, aiding both diagnosis and management </plain></SENT>
