<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approaches to the regeneration of periodontal tissue, which is the tooth-supporting connective tissue, have made some progress recently and provide a useful experimental model for the evaluation of future strategies to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodontal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AREAS COVERED: The ultimate goal of periodontal tissue regeneration is to reconstruct the ligament structure that will sustain the required mechanical force to connect with mineralized tissues such as cementum and alveolar bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this review, we discuss the proposed use of extracellular matrix (ECM) administration therapy as an additional therapeutic strategy to stem cell transplantation and cytokine administration in the current field of periodontal tissue regeneration therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EXPERT OPINION: Although various available tissue engineering technologies can now achieve periodontal tissue regeneration, ECM administration therapy is likely to play an essential future role in the development and regeneration of periodontal tissue and attenuate the signaling events that mediate tissue degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hence, ECM administration could serve as a novel technology in periodontal tissue regeneration and also as a viable approach to alleviating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
