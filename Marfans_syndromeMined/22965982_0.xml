<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Excess transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling is known to cause mitral valve degeneration and regurgitation in a mouse model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined if TGF-β signaling is dysregulated in clinical specimens of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> compared with explanted nondiseased mitral valves and we tested the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor blockers on TGF-β signaling in cultured human mitral valve cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Operative specimens, cultured valve tissues, and cultured valvular interstitial cells were obtained from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> undergoing mitral valve repair or from organ donors without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264765,C0026265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral valve disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increased extracellular matrix in diseased valve tissue correlated with an upregulation of TGF-β expression and signaling as evidenced by SMAD2/3 phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both TGF-β ligand and signaling mediators colocalized primarily to valvular interstitial cells suggesting autocrine/paracrine activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In cultured valve tissue, exogenous TGF-β increased basal extracellular matrix production, whereas serological neutralization of TGF-β inhibited disease-driven extracellular matrix overproduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TGF-β-induced extracellular matrix production in cultured valvular interstitial cells was dependent on SMAD2/3 and p38 signaling and was inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor blockers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TGF-β has a profibrotic role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Attenuation of TGF-β signaling by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor blockers may represent a mechanistically based strategy to modulate the pathological progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> in patients </plain></SENT>
