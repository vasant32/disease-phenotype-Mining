<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The 31 patients whose dissections we treated surgically accounted for 7.3% of the 426 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> treated surgically between 1978 and May 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 17 men and 14 women ranged in age from 24 to 77 years (mean: 45 +/- 12 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> was present in 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pain was observed at different times in 20. computed tomography scanning and magnetic resonance image proved useful in preoperative diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the 1st and 2nd false lumens was Stanford type A + B in 13, type B + B in 15, type A + A in 2, and localized abdominal dissection in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Descending aortic replacement was done in 18 patients, thoracoabdominal aortic replacement in 7, ascending aortic replacement in 3, and others in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients died in hospital and later during follow-up for 1-181 months (mean, 57 +/- 55 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pain recurring in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> should alert the physician to the possibility of 3-channeled dissection and the necessity of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of such dissection is high in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
