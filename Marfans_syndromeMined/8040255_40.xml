<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Quantitation of the soluble intracellular and insoluble extracellular fibrillin allowed discrimination of five groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Groups I (n = 8) and II (n = 19) synthesize reduced amounts of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-sized fibrillin, while synthesis is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in groups III (n = 6), IV (n = 18), and V (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When extracellular fibrillin deposition is measured, groups I and III deposit between 35 and 70% of control values, groups II and IV &lt; 35%, and group V &gt; 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A deletion mutant with a low transcript level from the mutant allele and seven additional patients have the group I protein phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disease in these patients is caused by a reduction in microfibrils associated with either a null allele, an unstable transcript, or an altered fibrillin product synthesized in low amounts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 68% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> individuals (groups II and IV), a dominant negative effect is invoked as the main pathogenetic mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Products made by the mutant allele in these fibroblasts are proposed to interfere with microfibril formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Insertion, deletion, and exon skipping mutations, resulting in smaller fibrillin products, exhibit the group II phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A truncated form of fibrillin of 60 kD was identified with specific fibrillin antibodies in one of the group II cell culture media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seven of the nine known missense mutations, giving rise to abnormal, but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-sized fibrillin molecules, are in group IV </plain></SENT>
