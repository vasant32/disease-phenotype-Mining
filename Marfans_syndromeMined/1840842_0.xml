<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Collagens precipitated from the culture medium and intracellular collagens were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with rabbit polyclonal monospecific antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The assay could detect 10 ng protein per well, and intraassay coefficients of variation were less than 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secreted collagens types I and III were also analysed by electrophoretic separation of [3H]-labelled alpha-chains under nonreducing and reducing conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These methods revealed a structural abnormality in one patient with clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and led to the postulation that the abnormality resulted from substitution of cysteine for another amino acid in collagen type I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In other patients an increase in the ratio of collagen type III:type I was detected, which may be secondary to an unknown biochemical defect </plain></SENT>
