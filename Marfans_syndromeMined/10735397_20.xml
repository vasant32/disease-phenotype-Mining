<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess screening practices for detecting potentially lethal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> in college-aged student-athletes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1110 National Collegiate Athletic Association member colleges and universities were surveyed between 1995 and 1997, with 879 (79%) responding to the questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Information on the administration and scope of the preparticipation screening process was obtained from the team physician or athletic director; preparticipation screening forms were evaluated for content and compared with 12 items recommended by the 1996 American Heart Association (<z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHA</z:chebi>) consensus panel screening guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Preparticipation screening was a requirement at 855 (97%) of 879 schools, was performed on campus at 713 schools (81 %), and was required annually by 446 schools (51 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Team physicians were responsible for examinations at 603 (85%) of 713 schools with on-campus screening, although 135 of these schools (19%) also approved nurse practitioners and 244 schools (34%) allowed athletic trainers to perform examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the history and physical examination screening forms analyzed from 625 institutions, only 163 schools (26%) had forms that contained at least 9 of the recommended 12 AHA screening guidelines and were judged to be adequate, whereas 150 (24%) contained 4 or fewer of these parameters and were considered to be inadequate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Smaller Division III schools were more likely than larger Division I schools to have inadequate screening forms (30% vs 14%; P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Relevant items that were omitted from more than 40% of the screening forms included history of exertional <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo>, or <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>; familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> or premature <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>; and physical stigmata or family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The preparticipation screening process used by many US colleges and universities may have limited potential to detect (or raise the suspicion of) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001626'>cardiovascular abnormalities</z:hpo> capable of causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in competitive student-athletes </plain></SENT>
