<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, a brief review of current Marfan genetic research is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Marfan patients undergoing aortic root replacement at the Johns Hopkins Hospital (September 1976-June 1995) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival and event-free curves were calculated and risk factors for early and late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were determined by univariate and multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two hundred twelve Marfan patients underwent aortic root replacement using composite graft (202), homograft (8) or valve-sparing procedures (2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred eighty-five patients underwent elective repair with no 30-day mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients underwent urgent surgery, primarily for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection; two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003496" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic rupture</z:e> died in the operating room </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival of the 212 patients was 88% at 5 years, 78% at 10 years and 71% at 14 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By multivariate analysis, only poor NYHA class, male gender and urgent surgery emerged as significant independent predictors of early or late mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histologic examination of excised Marfan aortic leaflets by immunofluorescent staining for fibrillin showed fragmentation of elastin-associated microfibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest cautious use of valve-sparing procedures in Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Over the last 5 years significant progress has been made in identifying mutant genes that code for defective fibrillin microfibrils in Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Attempts are underway to develop animal models of Marfan disease for study of possible gene therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Aortic root replacement can be performed in Marfan patients with operative risk under 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Long-term results are gratifying </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>At present, valve-sparing procedures should be used cautiously in Marfan patients because of fibrillin abnormalities in the preserved aortic valve leaflets </plain></SENT>
