<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in one common type, the calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like module (cbEGF), can lead to a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe as a model system structural and functional consequences of two typical mutations in cbEGF modules of fibrillin-1 (N548I, E1073K), resulting in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Large (80-120 kDa) <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and mutated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> were recombinantly expressed in mammalian cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both mutations did not alter synthesis and secretion of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> into the culture medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy after rotary shadowing and comparison of circular dichroism spectra exhibited minor structural differences between the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and mutated forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mutated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> were significantly more susceptible to proteolytic degradation by a variety of proteases as compared with their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most of the sensitive cleavage sites were mapped close to the mutations, indicating local structural changes within the mutated cbEGF modules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other cleavage sites, however, were observed at distances beyond the domain containing the mutation, suggesting longer range structural effects within tandemly repeated cbEGF modules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suggest that proteolytic degradation of mutated fibrillin-1 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and related disorders </plain></SENT>
