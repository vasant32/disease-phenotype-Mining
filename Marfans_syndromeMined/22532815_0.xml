<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta present a special challenge to primary care physicians, internists, and cardiac surgeons because they remain asymptomatic until they present with either dissection or rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: This review article is based on a selective search of the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the elderly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta are mainly caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In younger patients, the most common cause is <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>; less commonly, younger patients may have Loeys-Dietz syndrome, non-syndromic familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo>, or aortic valve malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genetic variants predisposing to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> have recently been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk of rupture and dissection depends on the aortic diameter: when the diameter exceeds 55 mm, surgery improves the outcome, as the risk of surgical complications is lower than the mortality due to rupture or dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A more accurate prognosis can be obtained by normalizing the aortic diameter to the body surface area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> or a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo>, the indications for surgery should be determined on an individual basis, depending on additional risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Randomized treatment trials are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The medical management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta consists of monitoring the size of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, controlling blood pressure, and treating any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> benefit from preventive treatment with beta-blockers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Advances in the pathophysiological understanding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> have led to the testing of new types of treatment, e.g., with AT1 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: With the aid of a risk-based treatment strategy, surgery can be properly timed to prevent dissection, which is usually lethal when it occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>More research is needed on the pathogenesis of this condition so that better preventive treatments can be developed </plain></SENT>
