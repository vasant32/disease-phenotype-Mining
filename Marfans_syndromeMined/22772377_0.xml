<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the genotype-phenotype correlation, we screened genetic mutations of fibrillin-1 (FBN1), transforming growth factor-β receptor-1 (TGFBR1) and transforming growth factor-β receptor-2 (TGFBR2) for TAAD in 7 affected families and 22 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 19 potential mutations identified in FBN1, 11 appeared novel while the others were recurrent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two mutations were detected in TGFBR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight patients carried no mutation in either of these genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Characterization of FBN1 c.5917+6T&gt;C in transfected HEK293 cells demonstrated that it caused skipping of exon 47, leading to the loss of the 33th calcium binding epidermal growth factor-like domain associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with exon 46, skipping of 47 did not cause patients <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To correlate genotypes with phenotypes in different human ancestries, we reviewed the published mutational studies on FBN1 and found that the probability of cardiovascular defects were significantly increased in Chinese patients with premature termination codon or splicing mutations than those with missense mutations (91.7 % vs 54.2 %, P = 0.0307) or with noncysteine-involved point mutations than those with cysteine-involved mutations (88.9 % vs 33.3 %, P = 0.0131) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, we conclude that exon 47 skipping of FBN1 leads preferentially to cardiovascular defects and human ancestries influence genotype-phenotype correlation in TAAD </plain></SENT>
