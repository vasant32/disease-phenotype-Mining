<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To measure bone mineral density (BMD) in a group of patients meeting Gand criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, comparatively with a group of healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) was used to measure BMD at the hip and wrist in 130 patients seen at the Multidisciplinary Marfan Clinic, Paris, France </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results were compared to values in the database of the absorptiometry machine (Hologic QDR100) and to values in 72 healthy height-matched controls including 35 whose body mass index (BMI) values were similar to those in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A history of fractures was noted in 32 (24.6%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Z-score values were significantly decreased in the patients compared to the Hologic database values at the femoral neck (-1.190+/-0.098, P&lt;0.0001) and wrist (-1.403+/-1.06; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients had significantly lower BMD values at the femoral neck compared to the height-matched controls (0.841+/-0.15 versus 1.010+/-0.017; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BMD values were also significantly lower in the patients compared to the controls of similar height and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BMD values did not correlate with history of fractures or acetabular protrusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the patients, BMD values lower than -2.5 correlated with presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Men and women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> have significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000938'>osteopenia</z:hpo> independent from BMI </plain></SENT>
