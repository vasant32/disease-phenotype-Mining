<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Independent of the inciting stimuli (biochemical/mechanical), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> development proceeds by a multifactorial process influenced by both cellular and extracellular mechanisms, resulting in alterations of the structure and composition of the vascular extracellular matrix (ECM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While the role of enhanced ECM proteolysis in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> formation remains undisputed, little attention has been focused on the upstream signaling events that drive the remodeling process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence highlighting the dysregulation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling in ascending <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAAs</z:chebi> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> patients has stimulated an interest in this intracellular signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, paradoxical discoveries have implicated both enhanced TGF-beta signaling and loss of function TGF-beta receptor mutations, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation; obfuscating a clear functional role for TGF-beta in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In an effort to elucidate this subject, TGF-beta signaling and its role in vascular remodeling and pathology will be reviewed, with the aim of identifying potential mechanisms of how TGF-beta signaling may contribute to the formation and progression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
