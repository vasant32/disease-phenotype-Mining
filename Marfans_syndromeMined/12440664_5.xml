<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Since 1991, 33 patients with CVGs underwent reoperation for one or more of the following indications: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> distal to the CVG (n = 20, 61%), false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (n = 13, 39%) and graft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (n = 7, 21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Operations included false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> repair (n = 13, 39%), graft replacement of distal ascending aortic or transverse aortic arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (n = 20, 61%) and aortic root re-replacement with a new CVG (n = 6, 18%) or homograft (n = 4, 12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Operative mortality was 15% (n = 5), including 2 of the 7 patients who had infected CVGs (29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 4 patients who had infected CVGs replaced with aortic root homografts survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complications included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001605'>vocal cord paralysis</z:hpo> (n = 4, 12%), <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> requiring reoperation (n = 3, 9%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n = 2, 6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Actuarial 3-year survival was 74.4% +/- 7.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reoperations in patients with CVGs remain challenging procedures with high associated morbidity and mortality, especially in the setting of graft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of homograft aortic root re-replacement for infected CVGs are encouraging </plain></SENT>
