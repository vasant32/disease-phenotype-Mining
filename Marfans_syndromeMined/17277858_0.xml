<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although neonatal and infant forms of the disease exist, the classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan Syndrome</z:e> is the most frequent form of presentation in childhood and adolescence, with a hereditary background in 70 to 85% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Due to the natural evolution of the disease, there is a progressive involvement of different organs or systems such as skeletal, cardiovascular, dura, ocular, skin-integument and lungs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the suspicion must arise on skeletal clinical aspects which are first evident signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cardiovascular involvement appears later but is the major life threatening complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When suspecting Marfan phenotype, it is mandatory to apply Ghent criteria based on family history and clinical findings to establish the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If diagnosis is confirmed, the severity of organ involvement must be assessed, to take preventive and/or therapeutic measures, including the search of new cases among relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When patients do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria, they must have a yearly evaluation considering the natural progressive evolution of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The aim of this review is to spread and unify criteria on this disease whose diagnosis is eminently clinical, that requires early integral and updated management by a multidisciplinary group, to obtain the best quality of life and survival </plain></SENT>
