<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Biochemical analysis of the tissue showed a qualitative and quantitative defect in alpha 2 chain production of Type I collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis of the aortic extract, two separate bands in the alpha 2 region and an increase of the alpha 1 to alpha 2 ratio were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Examination by electron microscopy revealed elastic fibre degeneration, helical collagen fibres, and metabolically active modified smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The formation of helical collagen fibres is attributed to a defect in the development of chains and cross-links of collagen precursors produced by the hypertrophic smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elastic fibre disintegration is believed to be due to a lack of support by Type I collagen fibres, which have decreased tensile strength </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A scheme for the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> and other connective tissue abnormalities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> is proposed as follows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Type I collagen fibres have decreased tensile strength because of a defect in the alpha 2 chain biosynthesis and decreased cross-linking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Over many years the wall of the ascending aorta is subjected to cyclic stresses and it dilates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Elastic fibres disintegrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The attempt at repair by metabolically activated modified smooth muscle cells is abortive, and rupture is likely to occur </plain></SENT>
