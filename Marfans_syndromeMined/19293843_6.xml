<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations identified in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene have been associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis of the gene is classically performed in probands with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> to offer diagnosis for at-risk relatives and in children highly suspected of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, FBN1 gene mutations are found in an ill-defined group of diseases termed 'type I fibrillinopathies', which are associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> and dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, there is growing awareness of the need to identify these non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> probands, for which FBN1 gene screening should be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To answer this need we compiled the molecular data obtained from the screening of the FBN1 gene in 586 probands, which had been addressed to our laboratory for molecular diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this group, the efficacy of FBN1 gene screening was high in classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> probands (72.5%,), low (58%) in those referred for incomplete <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and only slight (14.3%) for patients referred as possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using recursive partitioning, we found that the best predictor of the identification of a mutation in the FBN1 gene was the presence of features in at least three organ systems, combining one major, and various minor criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also show that our original recommendation of two systems involved with at least one with major criterion represents the minimal criteria because in probands not meeting these criteria, the yield of mutation identification drastically <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This recommendation should help clinicians and biologists in identifying probands with a high probability of carrying a FBN1 gene mutation, and thus optimize biological resources </plain></SENT>
