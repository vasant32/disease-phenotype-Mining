<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The adventitia of aortae of MS patients was noticed to be composing of a certain amount of thin type III collagen fibers, and the reticular layer of skin consisted of large amount of thin type III collagen fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that the distribution of collagen type in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> becomes abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="18095">Hydroxyproline</z:chebi> assay analysis showed no significant difference obtained on the total collagen content of aorta and skin between the MS patients and the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anyhow, content of acid soluble collagen in the aortae of MS patients was learnt to be increased significantly (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CNBr-cleavage electrophoresis showed also change of fragment CB8 band in one case </plain></SENT>
