<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: There is little evidence in the medical literature about safety of <z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp> device closure and its effects on aortic root diameter in Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reported on nine Marfan patients whose ducts were occluded by coil or Amplatzer Duct Occluder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Two patients had aneurismal type E ducts which were closed by a single coil, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The others had conical ducts for which even Amplatzer occluder, stiff, or double coils were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No untoward consequence was found during a median follow up period of 18.5 months (range 3 months to 6.33 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients had small residual shunts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The observed change in the mean ratio of aortic root diameter to its estimated value was statistically insignificant in seven patients who had complete data on their aortic root diameter before <z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp> closure and during the follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that <z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp> device closure in Marfan patients is safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Risk of residual shunt is higher even after closure of small ducts </plain></SENT>
