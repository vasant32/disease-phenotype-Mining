<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preclinical and clinical studies indicate the utility of these agents in <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo>, particularly in augmentation of existing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapies, such as radiation and chemotherapy, as well as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> vaccines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are also reports of specialized applications, such as the reduction of vascular symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we consider why the TGFβ signalling pathway is a drug target, the potential clinical applications of TGFβ inhibition, the issues arising with anti-TGFβ therapy and how these might be tackled using personalized approaches to dosing, monitoring of biomarkers as well as brief and/or localized drug-dosing regimens </plain></SENT>
