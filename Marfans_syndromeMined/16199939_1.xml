<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The revised diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> were used for inclusion in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (n = 13), the incidence (n = 9) and indication for surgical intervention (n = 4) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003179'>protrusio acetabuli</z:hpo> were evaluated by retrospective radiographic review, clinical findings, and family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the identification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003179'>protrusio acetabuli</z:hpo>, the presence of an abnormal acetabular line position (&gt;1 mm medial to the ilioischial line in boys, &gt;3 mm in girls), a center-edge angle of Wiberg of 40 degrees or more, or crossing of the teardrop by the ilioischial line was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that serial radiographic investigations, reinforced with a well-documented family history of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003179'>protrusio acetabuli</z:hpo>, are needed to rule out progression of the deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When progression of the deformity is suggested in a skeletally immature Marfan patient, surgical intervention by closure of the triradiate cartilage is indicated, regardless of the absence of hip complaints or limitation of range of motion </plain></SENT>
