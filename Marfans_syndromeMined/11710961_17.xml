<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Mutations in the fibrillin -1 gene (FBN1) cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>), an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> multi-system <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 200 different mutations reported in the 235 kb, 65 exon-containing gene include only one family with a genomic multi-exon deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used long-range RT-PCR for mutation detection and long-range genomic PCR and DNA sequencing for identification of deletion breakpoints, allele-specific transcript analyses to determine stability of the mutant <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, and pulse-chase studies to quantitate fibrillin synthesis and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_178'>extracellular matrix deposition</z:mpath> in cultured fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Southern blots of genomic DNA were probed with three overlapping fragments covering the FBN1 coding exons RESULTS: Two novel multi-exon FBN1 deletions were discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Identical nucleotide pentamers were found at or near the intronic breakpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a Case with classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, an in-frame deletion of exons 42 and 43 removed the C-terminal 24 amino acids of the 5th LTBP (8-cysteine) domain and the adjacent 25th calcium-binding EGF-like (6-cysteine) domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mutant <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was stable, but fibrillin synthesis and matrix deposition were significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A Case with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011463'>childhood-onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> has a de novo deletion of exons 44-46 that removed three EGF-like domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin protein synthesis was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but matrix deposition was strikingly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No genomic rearrangements were detected by Southern analysis of 18 unrelated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> samples negative for FBN1 mutation screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Two novel deletion cases expand knowledge of mutational mechanisms and genotype/phenotype correlations of fibrillinopathies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Deletions or mutations affecting an LTBP domain may result in unstable mutant protein cleavage products that interfere with microfibril assembly </plain></SENT>
