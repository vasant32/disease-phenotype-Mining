<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A modified technique to the reattachment of the coronary ostia in the aortic root replacement is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The left coronary ostium is excised semicircumferentially in an aortic button with its subostial quarter remained as a joint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A collagen impregnated 10-mm Dacron interposition tube graft is sutured rectangularly to the face of the button with the interrupted pledgeted horizontal mattress sutures <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> running through the button wall in outside-in fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The other end of the graft is beveled and sutured end-to-side cephalad to the aortic conduit in order to join each other with straightness assuring the distance between the right coronary button and the aortic conduit to be anastomosed directly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The left coronary button can incline passively with the long axis of the coronary graft, like a "shell", and this allows equivalent distribution of tension on the anastomosis and a straightness of the graft to create the laminar flow in it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The right coronary button is anastomosed to the aortic conduit opposite the ostium with a running over-and-over suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This procedure has been used in a 35-year-old male with annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> complicated with type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient discharged on the 26th postoperative day without any complications nor angiographic problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found this procedure useful in terms of the security of the coronary anastomosis and geometrical arrangement of the conduits </plain></SENT>
