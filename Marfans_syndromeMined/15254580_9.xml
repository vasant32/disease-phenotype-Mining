<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A report in this issue now proposes that loss of fibrillin-1 protein by any of several mechanisms and the subsequent effect on the pool of TGF-beta may be more relevant in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> than mechanisms previously proposed in a dominant-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0684309" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">disease model</z:e> </plain></SENT>
