<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Purpose: We have been using the flanged composite aortic prosthesis and Carrel button technique to re-attach the coronary ostia in aortic root replacement procedures at our institution over the last twenty five years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to evaluate the long-term results of aortic root replacement with this technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: A total of 73 patients from January 1984 to August 2010 were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age was 52.7 Â± 14.4 years (range 28-80 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 48 male and 25 female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>44 patients (60.3%) had annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath>, and 15 patients (20.5%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> was recognized in 12 patients (16.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results: The early mortality rate was 5.5% (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were multiple organ failures in two patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> in another two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival rate was 84.2% at 5 years, 64.3% at 15 years and 51.9% at 25 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only one patient with <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp> needed a reoperation because of coronary pseudoaneurysm after 23 years from the previous operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: This modified Bentall procedure is reliable and safe, with superior long-term survival and a low rate of aortic reoperation </plain></SENT>
