<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (AAD) is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate assessment and therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A patient suffering from AAD often presents with an insignificant or irrelevant medical history, giving rise to possible misdiagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this retrospective study is to address the problem of misdiagnosing AD and the different imaging studies used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 2000 to December 2004, 49 patients (41 men and 8 women, aged from 18-75 years old) presented to the Emergency Department of our hospital for different reasons and finally diagnosed with AAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of those patients suffered from arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, one from giant cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> and another patient from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of AAD was made by chest X-ray, contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT), transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and coronary angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Initial misdiagnosis occurred in fifteen patients (31%) later found to be suffering from AAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The misdiagnosis was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> in 12 patients and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in another three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic dissection</z:hpo> may present with a variety of clinical manifestations, like <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100519'>anuria</z:hpo>, pulse deficits, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nearly a third of the patients found to be suffering from AD, were initially otherwise diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Key in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> is to maintain a high level of suspicion for this diagnosis </plain></SENT>
