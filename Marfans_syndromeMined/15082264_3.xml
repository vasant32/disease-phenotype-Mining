<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To prove whether different indications for valve sparing aortic root reconstruction may have an impact on the outcome and longevity of the repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From July 1993 to March 2003, the reimplantation technique for valve sparing aortic root reconstruction was applied to 232 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 44 patients, indication for operation was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> type A (AADA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients were compared with 44 randomised patients operated for aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (root) by matched pair analysis with respect to age, gender, time point of operation and presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Peri- and post-operative courses with focus on survival and valvular stability were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pre-operative grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> was 2.4+/-1 in root vs. 1.5+/-1.7 in AADA (P = 0.004) Mean CPB-time (214+/-60 vs. 171+/-42 min;P &lt; 0.001), aortic cross clamp time (158+/-40 vs. 129+/-39 min; P = 0.001) and stay on ICU (5.2+/-9 vs. 1.7+/-1 days; P = 0.034) were longer for AADA, while hospitalisation was comparable (14+/-10 vs. 14+/-7 days; P = 0.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five patients (11.4%) from AADA died peri-operatively compared to no patient from root (P = 0.055) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were valve-related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Re-thoracotomy rate was 6.8% for both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 19+/-21 months for AADA vs. 28+/-21 months for root (P = 0.038) Survival at 3 years was 88+/-5% for AADA and 100% for root (P = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Freedom from valvular reoperation was 97+/-2.7% for root and 97+/-3% for AADA at 3 years (P = 0.44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At last investigation, mean grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> for AADA was 0.2+/-0.3 compared to 0.3+/-0.3 for root (P = 0.34) CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the underlying indication, the aortic valve preserving reimplantation technique can be performed with favourable functional results </plain></SENT>
