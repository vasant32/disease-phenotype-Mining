<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between mutations in the Fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene and spontaneous CSF <z:hpo ids='HP_0011106'>hypovolemia</z:hpo> (SCH) in a Korean population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 10 consecutive patients with SCH without clinical characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The genetic analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Direct sequencing analysis of the FBN1 gene identified 15 genetic variations, of which 5 coding (3 synonymous, 2 nonsynonymous) and 8 intronic variations were listed in the single nucleotide polymorphism database (dbSNP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other 2 variations, c.2728 - 12T &gt; C in intron 21 and c.4582 - 19A &gt; G in intron 35, were also observed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls with estimated frequencies of 0.06 and 0.15, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We could not identify any FBN1 variations possibly associated with SCH in our study population </plain></SENT>
