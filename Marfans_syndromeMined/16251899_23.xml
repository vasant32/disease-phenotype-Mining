<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four mutations have been identified to date in five unrelated families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We screened TGFBR2 gene by direct automated sequencing in two adult patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> according to Ghent criteria, and in one girl clinically suspected as affected on the basis of a major cardiovascular criterion and skeletal involvement, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> proven not to carry mutations in the exon-intron boundaries of FBN1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified two novel and one known TGFBR2 gene mutations in the three unrelated probands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The D446N was identified in a 4-year-old girl with de novo disease characterized by severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and skeletal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The M425V and R460H mutations were identified in two familial, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> MFSs, both characterized by major cardio-skeletal signs and absence of major ocular signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mutation R460H has been recently reported in a family with thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The three mutations are absent in 192 controls and affect evolutionarily conserved residues of the serine/threonine kinase domain (exon 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data support the recently reported association between TGFBR2 gene and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> without major ocular signs (MFS2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number of genotyped cases however is too low to confirm that major ocular signs are characteristically absent in MFS2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients proven or suspected to be affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> with negative FBN1 gene screening could benefit from rapid investigation of the TGFBR2 gene </plain></SENT>
