<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen Marfan patients who were operated on for annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> (AAE) with or without type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> required reoperation through re-median sternotomy for various reasons in the late postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Average time interval between the initial operation and the late reoperation was 8.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reoperative procedures used in this series included re-composite graft replacement in 1 patient, total arch replacement (TAR) in 1, and re-composite graft replacement with TAR in 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 2 in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (14.3%); one patient died of low output syndrome (LOS) after combined Bentall and TAR while the other suffered a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> probably due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> after combined Cabrol and TAR procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight patients underwent additional descending or thoracoabdominal aortic replacement in the late postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Button technique (Carrel patch technique) with small side hole in the composite graft is the operative procedure of choice for AAE to reduce the risk of complications related to coronary artery anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Button technique and concomitant TAR that helps to avoid the possibility of reoperation on the aortic arch through re-median sternotomy, is the preferred technique for AAE with type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
