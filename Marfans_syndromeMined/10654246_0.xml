<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aortic diameters were measured at the sinus of Valsalva, the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, and the abdominal aorta in 20 patients (aged 5-63 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and 30 age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aortic distensibility was calculated as follows: aortic distensibility = 2 (change in aortic diameter)/(diastolic aortic diameter) (systolic pressure-diastolic pressure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aortic diameter increased with age in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diameters of the sinus of Valsalva and the ascending aorta were greater in the Marfan group than in the control group, and increased even after adolescence in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aortic distensibility was the highest at the abdominal aorta and the lowest at the sinus of Valsalva in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aortic distensibility decreased with age in both groups, but aortas were less distensible in the Marfan group than in the control group at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sinus of Valsalva and the ascending aorta dilate abnormally after adolescence in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, aortic elastic properties in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> were abnormal even in childhood </plain></SENT>
