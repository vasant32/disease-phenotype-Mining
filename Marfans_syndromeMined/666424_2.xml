<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and 1, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, type II </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no early or late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in a follow-up period of 2, 7, and 12 months, respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two underwent postoperative aortography that disclosed well-functioning valves and good filling of the coronary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> is best treated by the technique of total replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic valve by a composite valve-tube graft, and that the homologous dura mater valve, for its characteristics of central flow, lack of need for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>, and durability, represents a reasonable alternative for use in this situation </plain></SENT>
