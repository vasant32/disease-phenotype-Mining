<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: In dissection aorta involving the whole aorta from the left subclavian artery surgical repair may be a high risk procedure while an endovascular procedure would not be feasible by itself in view of the absence of a safe landing zone and the risk of blocking the brain and arm circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A hybrid procedure is presented to tackle such a problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 42-year-old Marfan, with a previous history of a Bentall procedure 10 years back, presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Investigations revealed a large dissection starting from the left subclavian to the right renal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since a safe landing zone was required which would block off the arch vessels, first a redo sternotomy was performed and under femoro-femoral cardio-pulmonary bypass (CPB), a short segment of Dacron graft was interposed between the previous Bentall graft and the arch of aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On to this graft, 2 additional grafts were anastomosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 14 X 9 bifurcated graft to go to the right brachiocephalic and the left common carotid, and a 9 mm side arm to facilitate the positioning of the endograft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After coming off CPB, a guide wire was manipulated from the femoral artery into the side graft with a snare and the endograft was inserted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The false lumen was successfully obliterated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patient made a complete recovery with no neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A hybrid procedure with an innovative technique of preserving the brain and arm circulation and a new technique of facilitating proper positioning of the endostent with a side arm conduit is presented </plain></SENT>
