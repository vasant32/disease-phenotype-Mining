<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The results are presented from the first year of our clinic in Edinburgh </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These were included in the setting up of a computerized Register of Ascertainment and Prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Inherited Disease</z:e> ('RAPID') in the Department of Human Genetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 45 relatives who had greater than 10% risk were ascertained from fifteen families with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hereditary diseases</z:e>; 24 relatives had 10% risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000510'>retinitis pigmentosa</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pupils at the Royal Blind School, Edinburgh, were surveyed and it was found that 40% of the 100 pupils had definitely inherited severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015397" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">eye disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only 31% , had definitely non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disease</z:e>, for which reassuring counseling can be given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 29% we could not be sure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hereditary disease</z:e> we ascertained 51 relatives at greater than 10% risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Any patient with a fairly symmetrical 'quiet' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015397" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">eye disease</z:e>, especially if congenital, should be suspected of having an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hereditary disease</z:e>--presumably due to a recessive gene, even if the parents are not consanguineous, but possibly due to a mutation which could prove dominant; a search of the literature in such cases is useful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although patients with a 'recessive' disease can be reassured that the (extra) risk to their children is small, it is worth warning them that in their families a consanguineous marriage is more liable than usual to produce affected children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A case of oculo-pharyngeal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> was seen and two cases of Leber's <z:hpo ids='HP_0007875'>congenital amaurosis</z:hpo>: the commonest diagnosis was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000510'>retinitis pigmentosa</z:hpo>, and there were several cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Royal Blind School takes both boys and girls and one couple have recently married, the male with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000510'>retinitis pigmentosa</z:hpo> and the female with dominantly inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
