<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is a relatively common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heritable disorder</z:e> of connective tissue that affects numerous organ systems, but the most severe complication is <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> and dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A variety of medical and surgical approaches are available for managing the cardiovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to compare elective composite graft surgery, elective valve-sparing surgery, and medical management for patients with both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and thoracic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> on the basis of life expectancy with differing diameters of the aortic root and rate of increase in the aortic root size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A Markov decision analysis model was constructed to compare the 2 surgical options with watchful waiting with medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For our base-case analysis of a 20-year-old patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo>, the aortic valve-sparing option was preferred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It extended life expectancy to 73.8 years compared with the medical treatment option (71.4 years) and with the composite graft surgery (72.7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results show that there is a better outcome for a patient with an aortic root diameter between 3.0 and 3.5 cm with early prophylactic surgery than with deferred or emergency surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Medical treatment was preferred when the aortic root diameter was smaller than 3.0 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although long-term follow-up data are not yet available, it appears that advances in the technique of valve-sparing surgery have made it the preferred option to composite graft, primarily to avoid the complications of anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study indicates that patients who have an aortic root diameter of larger than 3.0 cm should be considered for prophylactic aortic surgery </plain></SENT>
