<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The identity between the human and bovine sequences is 97.8% at the amino acid level and 92% at the nucleotide level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The bovine fibrillin sequence contains the same number and type of motifs as the human FBN1 sequence, including the same number of putative calcium binding sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the motifs conform to the patterns demonstrated in the human sequence, and many of the differences in identity between the sequences are conservative </plain></SENT>
