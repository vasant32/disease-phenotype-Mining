<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To describe a technique for iris fixation of acrylic intraocular lenses (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOLs</z:e>) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> and evaluate the medium-term anatomical and functional results in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Pediatric Ophthalmology Department, Fondation Rothschild, Paris, France </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective study included 17 eyes of 9 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The technique consisted of lens ablation, leaving in place the capsule in the zone of nonruptured zonule, and an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e> placement in the remaining sulcus with 2 iris sutures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The age of patients, postoperative complications, follow-up, anatomical results, final refraction, and visual acuity were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median age was 4.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One case of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011886'>hyphema</z:hpo> and 1 case of aseptic <z:mp ids='MP_0003665'>endophthalmitis</z:mp> occurred and resolved after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The anatomical outcome was favorable in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, with centered <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOLs</z:e> and round pupils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 16.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean final refraction was +0.18 diopter, and mean final best corrected visual acuity was 20/32 (range 20/50 to 20/20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that iris fixation of foldable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOLs</z:e> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> in children can lead to good anatomical and functional results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The use of the remaining part of the sulcus is helpful in reaching correct positioning of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The complication rate is similar to that with other techniques described in the literature, whereas the small incision and the absence of transscleral sutures could simplify the short-term and long-term evolution </plain></SENT>
