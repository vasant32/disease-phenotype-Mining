<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-six patients (22.6%) suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (24 AN, 13 AD, 9 CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients (14.7%) had undergone a previous cardiac or aortic operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ascending aortic replacement was extended to the transverse arch in 28 patients (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A mechanical valve was used in 193 cases (95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The technique of coronary reattachment has varied with time and according to the aortic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The classic "Bentall" technique was used in 87 patients (43%), the "button" technique in 74 (36%), the "Cabrol" technique in 26 (13%) and a "mixed" technique in 16 cases (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hospital mortality rate was 7.3% (15/203) (AN: 2.3%, CD: 11.4%, AD: 21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The only predictors of hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were emergency AD (p &lt; 0.03) and arch replacement (p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 46 +/- 10 months (2-246) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall long-term survival rate was (Kaplan Meier) 89 +/- 6% at 1 year, 77.9% at 5 years, 67.7 +/- 12% at 10 years and 61.3% +/- 15% at 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 10 years survival rate is significantly higher in patients with AN (77.8 +/- 11%) than in those with AD (61.6 +/- 17%) (Log.rank: p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The late survival rate is also significantly higher after the "button" or Bentall reimplantation that after the "Cabrol" or "mixed" methods (90 +/- 5% in the "button" group and 88.7 +/- 6%, 83.8 +/- 9% and 76.6 +/- 12% in the "Bentall" group vs 80 +/- 18%, 63 +/- 21% and 58 +/- 35% in the "Cabrol" group at 1, 5 and 8 years, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, ascending aortic replacement with a composite graft is a safe procedure especially when performed electively in patients with dystrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The technique of coronary reimplantation has a significant on the long-term results </plain></SENT>
