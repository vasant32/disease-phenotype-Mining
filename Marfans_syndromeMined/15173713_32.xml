<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgical approaches to valve sparing differ with regard to preservation of the native sinuses of Valsalva </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The role of the sinuses and the importance of maintaining them remain controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: By using a time-resolved, 3-dimensional, phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging technique, aortic root and aortic blood velocity data were acquired from 2 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> 6 months after aortic valve-sparing surgery with straight Dacron grafts and contrasted with data from 6 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aortas vortical blood flow became apparent in the individual sinuses after peak systole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The vortices filled the available space behind the valve leaflets and persisted until diastole, expanding and moving inward during aortic valve closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no vortices were observed in the postoperative patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> with negligible sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Changes in supravalvular flow accompany loss of sinus architecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whether the presence, size, and velocity of supravalvular vortices affects the function or durability of the preserved aortic valve remains to be studied </plain></SENT>
