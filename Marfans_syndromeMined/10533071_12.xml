<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the FBN1 gene for mutations in people who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> using three methods: single-chain polymorphism analysis (SSCP) with heteroduplex (HA) analysis, enzyme-mediated cleavage (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMC</z:e>) of heteroduplexes, and direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also used these methods to search for mutations in the P53 gene in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMC</z:e> was most efficient for detecting mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the cost favored SSCP with heteroduplex analysis, provided conditions did not need to be optimized to detect a mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Until more cost-effective and sensitive methods are developed to detect unknown mutations in large genes, diagnosis of many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> will depend on the willingness of an investigator who is studying a particular disorder to perform clinical molecular testing and have the laboratory accredited </plain></SENT>
