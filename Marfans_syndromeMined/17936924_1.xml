<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We screened the TGFBR1 gene in 46 Marfan patients in whom mutations in FBN1 and TGFBR2 genes were excluded and the analysis of Ex1 was extended to additional 114 Marfan patients and 237 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We detected two potentially pathological sequence variants: the TGFBR1 6Ala allele whose frequency was higher in the group of Marfan patients (0.13) than in the controls (0.08) (p=0.013; OR=1.69) and an insertion of 20 nucleotides in the 5'UTR that turned out to be a familial silent rare polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that TGFBR1 sequence variants may act not only as major, but also as low penetrance alleles of the clinical phenotype in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
