<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The experience of the authors with 22 severely affected infants diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in the first 3 months of life is described and the literature on 32 additional infants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was found that serious cardiac pathology (82% of the patients described in the article, 94% of those described in the literature) may be present at birth, and that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002803'>congenital contractures</z:hpo> (64% of our cases, 47% of literature cases) are often an associated finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other useful clinical findings included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000268'>dolichocephaly</z:hpo>, a characteristic facies, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000156'>high-arched palate</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000347'>micrognathia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001382'>hyperextensible joints</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001763'>pes planus</z:hpo>, anterior chest deformity, iridodenesis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000485'>megalocornea</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>dislocated lenses</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography was useful as a noninvasive method for defining the extent of cardiovascular involvement and following its course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Characteristic cardiac findings in early life included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, valvular regurgitation, and aortic root dilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardiac function ranged from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> to poor, with a tendency to worsen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 22 cases 3 infants died during the first year of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Morbidity and mortality may be high when <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is diagnosed during infancy, and prompt recognition of this phenotype can facilitate management and counseling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most such severe cases appear to be due to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> mutation in a single germ cell of one parent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Many familial cases may have milder manifestations, be more difficult to detect during infancy, and have a better prognosis </plain></SENT>
