<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Since October 1997, 47 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> received spinal fixation with the TRAFIX instrumentation at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The average age was 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>3 years (range 10 to 38 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 27 idiopathic cases, 16 congenital cases, 2 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and 2 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve of the 47 patients underwent anterior release, while 4 patients received the revision approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average follow-up time was 26 months (13 -38 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The measurements of primary coronal deformity before and after surgery were 74 degrees (50 degrees approximately 115 degrees) and 38.7 degrees (11 approximately 95 degrees), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average curve correction was 54% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average number of fused segments was 12.5 (7 approximately 17) vertebrae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The distance between the center of apex and the C7 plumb line was 56.8 mm before surgery (25 approximately 107 mm) and 31 mm after surgery (10 approximately 87 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The TRAFIX instrumentation provides three-dimensional correction with refinement, convenience and reliable fixation </plain></SENT>
