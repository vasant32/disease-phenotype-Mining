<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To identify mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) and provide further information about genotype-phenotype correlations in Chinese patients with predominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> (EL) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001519'>marfanoid habitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients from seven Chinese families underwent complete physical, ophthalmic, and cardiovascular examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes of peripheral blood from the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 65 exons and flanking intronic sequences of FBN1 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and screened for mutation by direct DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three novel mutations, c.203G&gt;T in exon 2, c.502T&gt;C in exon 5, and c.2096G&gt;C in exon 16 as well as four known mutations, c.364C&gt;T in exon 4, c.1633C&gt;T in exon 13, c.1879C&gt;T in exon 15, and c.4588C&gt;T in exon37, were identified in FBN1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We identified three novel mutations and four known mutations in FBN1 and found cysteine substitution highly related to EL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results expand the mutation spectrum in FBN1 and enrich our knowledge of genotype-phenotype correlations due to FBN1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first report of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32460">cysteine residue</z:chebi> loss in the unique <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29318,29339">NH2</z:chebi>-terminal domain of fibrillin-1 </plain></SENT>
