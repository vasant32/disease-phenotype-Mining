<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To describe the clinical features and surgical outcomes in a series of pediatric patients with rhegmatogenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachments</z:hpo> in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective study of pediatric patients (age 1 to 15 years) with rhegmatogenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> dated between January 1995 and December 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with perforating ocular trauma were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into four groups according to the predisposing factors: Group 1, those with congenital or developmental anomalies; Group 2, those with trauma history; Group 3, those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo> greater than -3 D but excluding patients in Groups 1 and 2; and Group 4, the others with miscellaneous etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients' age, sex, medical history, ocular history, type of detachment, macular status, refractive status, previous visual acuity, number and type of surgeries performed, postoperative <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> status, and current visual acuity were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-five eyes of 32 patients were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median age was 13 years, and 75% of patients were boys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 17 eyes (49%) in Group 1, 8 in Group 2 (23%), 8 in Group 3 (23%), and 2 in Group 4 (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> was present in 7 patients (22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In Group 1, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy was present in 7 eyes; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e> was noted in 5 eyes; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> was present in 3 eyes; mental and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> was present in 2 eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Macula sparing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> was found in 3 eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> attachment was achieved in 28/35 eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Visual recovery was modest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Congenital or developmental anomalies, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo>, and trauma were the most common risk factors for pediatric rhegmatogenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Regular follow-up for children at risk of developing rhegmatogenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> is necessary for early detection </plain></SENT>
