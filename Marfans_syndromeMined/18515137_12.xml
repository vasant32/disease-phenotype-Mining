<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Pathological aortic flow patterns differ significantly from haemodynamics within the healthy aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Development and impact of pathological flow is largely unknown and might affect pathogenesis and the progression of thoracic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study presents pathological blood-flow patterns within a series of six patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> investigated with high-detail flow-sensitive, four-dimensional (4D)-MRI and three-dimensional (3D) computer-aided flow-visualisation strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were acquired on a 3T magnetic resonance system (TRIO, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using a flow-sensitive 4D (time-resolved 3D) sequence protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurements were taken in synchrony with the cardiac cycle and under respiration control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After data pre-processing, blood-flow was visualised by means of systolic 3D streamlines and time-resolved 3D particle traces using the software EnSight (CEI, Apex, NC, USA) and homemade visualisation tools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We investigated six adult patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and one healthy individual and findings were compared to 3D-haemodynamics of the <z:mp ids='MP_0010470'>dilated ascending aorta</z:mp> described in current literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> blood-flow in the healthy volunteer resulted in highest velocities of up to 1 ms in the ascending and descending aorta, a right-handed helical flow pattern featuring 0.5-1.5 revolutions within the ascending aorta was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> presented either increased right-handed helical flow with flow acceleration along the great curvature, or multiple vortical flows in the sinuses and middle of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One Marfan-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> exhibited increased vortical flow in the dilated sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One pseudo-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> at the proximal anastomosis of an earlier supracoronary aortic replacement showed extensive vortex formation inside the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>'s lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in a patient with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> revealed one major vortex formation directly above the aortic valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> following congenital valvular stenosis and commissurotomy in childhood was characterised by helical diastolic backflow in the central ascending aorta and a vortex at the small curvature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> reveal considerable differences in local flow patterns among themselves and compared to healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further investigations are necessary to identify flow patterns predisposing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> development or adverse events in the course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
