<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonography revealed a double lumen in the innominate and right common carotid (RCCA) arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The false lumen extended from the aortic arch to the distal RCCA and compressed and nearly occluded the true lumen in the innominate artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the end of the RCCA was a large tear allowing communication between the false and true lumens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colour-coded Doppler sonography showed blood passing from the false lumen into the true lumen and antegrade flow in the false lumen but reverse flow in the true channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A dynamic test, as used in accessing for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038531" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subclavian steal syndrome</z:e>, producing reactive hyperaemia, showed the retrograde flow in the true channel to be markedly increased, supplying the subclavian artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We emphasie the importance of functional description of an abnormal haemodynamic situation, which in this case helped to avoid unnecessary surgery to the supra-aortic arteries </plain></SENT>
