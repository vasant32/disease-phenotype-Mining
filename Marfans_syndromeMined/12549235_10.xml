<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence and the proportion of smooth muscle, collagen, and elastin proteins contribute to the compliance of the vessel wall with the latter being the most extensible component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, elastin fibers fracture at low stresses contributing to a decrease of the aortic compliance and consequently to an elevation of the pulse pressure, which is a risk factor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early detection of a decrease in the aortic compliance could help to identify early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in asymptomatic patients and monitor the results of the therapeutic interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, estimation of the aortic compliance can be used for both screening as well as long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging which is a noninvasive, accurate, and reproducible method can estimate the compliance of the aortic wall either by measuring the relative change in cross sectional area of a chosen segment using ECG-triggered spin echo or gradient echo sequences or by measuring the pulse wave velocity through the aorta using the phase contrast-magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both techniques have been validated and many sudies suggest MRI as a valuable tool for evaluating aortic wall function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, large prospective studies are mandatory for the method to be established as a screening tool </plain></SENT>
