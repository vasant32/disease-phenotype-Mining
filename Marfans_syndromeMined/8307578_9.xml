<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have mapped the human genes for two fibrillins to chromosome bands 15q21 (FBN1) and 5q23-q31 (FBN2) and have demonstrated that FBN1 mutations are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, while FBN2 is linked to the gene for congenital contractural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the isolation of genomic clones of the corresponding mouse fibrillin genes (Fbn-1 and Fbn-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By analyzing a mapping panel of mouse x rodent somatic hybrid cell lines, we have assigned the Fbn-1 gene to mouse chromosome 2 and the Fbn-2 gene to mouse chromosome 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then sublocalized the fibrillin genes to bands 2F (Fbn-1) and 18D-E1 (Fbn-2) by fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These regions are known to exhibit conserved synteny with the regions on human chromosomes 15 and 5 that carry the homologous human fibrillin genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the Fbn-1 gene maps in the vicinity of the gene for a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> on mouse chromosome 2 called <z:mp ids='MP_0001198'>Tight-skin</z:mp> (Tsk) </plain></SENT>
