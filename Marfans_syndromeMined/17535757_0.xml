<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Preservation of the aortic valve using the technique described by David has been shown to be as effective as the Bentall-De Bono procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It avoids both the need for long-term anticoagulation and the complications associated with mechanical prostheses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report our initial experience using this technique in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between April 2004 and April 2006, we used the David reimplantation technique in 40 patients with an aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their median age was 29 years (13-55 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography showed that the median diameter of the aortic sinus was 53 mm (46-59 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 17 patients, aortic valve preservation was possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No patient died during hospitalization and there were no significant complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On echocardiography at discharge, no patient had greater than grade-II <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up period of 8 months (1-24 months), one patient died due to rupture of an abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The others are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in New York Heart Association class I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Preservation of the aortic valve by means of valve reimplantation produced excellent results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It avoided both the thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications associated with prostheses and the need for long-term anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>If reimplanted valves continue to function adequately over the long term, this technique should become the treatment of choice for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
