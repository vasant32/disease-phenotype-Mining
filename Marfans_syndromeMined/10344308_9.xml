<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histochemical and morphometric data demonstrated that the content of elastic fibers in the perichondrium, periosteum, and knee capsule of the individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> was dramatically reduced in comparison with control tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructurally the elastic fibers appeared fragmented and indented, because of the presence of discontinuous aggregates of elastin among randomly dispersed filaments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities of the articular capsule argue that these fibers could be functionally incompetent to resist <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stress, predisposing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001388'>joint laxity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, alterations in both perichondrium and periosteum seems to support our previous hypotheses about the control of long-bone growth exerted by elastic fibers </plain></SENT>
