<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We reviewed our experience with mechanical valves inserted between 1988 and 2002 in children aged 15 years or younger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Hospital files were extracted retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was completed by March 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 41 patients, we inserted a valve in atrioventricular position in 27 children, having a median age of 3.1 years, ranging from 0.4 to 14.5 years, and in aortic position in the remaining 14, having a median age of 13.5 years, and a range from 7.0 to 14.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the valves inserted in atrioventricular position, the underlying disease was congenital in 23, rheumatic in two, post-endocarditic in one, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 7.7 years, with standard deviation of 5.3, giving a total follow-up of 209 patient years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mortality at 30 days was 7%, and survival was 73% at up to 16 years follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Events related to anticoagulation were seen in 3 patients, corresponding to 1.4% per patient year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 6 patients (22%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>heart block</z:hpo> ensued which required implantation of a pacemaker treatment, and 5 patients (19%) had reoperations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For the implantations in aortic position, the underlying disease was congenital in 13, stenosis in 10 and insufficiency in three, and post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 6.8 years, with standard deviation of 4.6, giving a total of 95 patient years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We lost one patient within 30 days (7.7% mortality), and survival was 77% at up to 13 years follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no incidents of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, nor events related to anticoagulation, but one patient (7%) needed insertion of a pacemaker due to a perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>heart block</z:hpo>, and one (7%) required new valvar replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although preferably avoided, mechanical valves can be implanted in children with an acceptable mortality and morbidity, and good long-term results </plain></SENT>
