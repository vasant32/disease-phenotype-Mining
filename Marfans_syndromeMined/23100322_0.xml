<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The complex pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> involves changes in transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling and increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin-1 and elastin have repeated Gly-x-x- Pro-Gly (GxxPG) motifs that can induce a number of effects including macrophage chemotaxis and increased MMP activity by induction of signaling through the elastin-binding protein (EBP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this work, we test the hypothesis that antagonism of GxxPG fragments can suppress disease progression in the Marfan aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin-1 underexpressing mgR/mgR Marfan mice were treated with weekly intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of an antibody directed against GxxPG fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The treatment was started at 3 weeks of age and continued for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The treatment signiﬁcantly reduced MMP-2, MMP-9 and pSmad2 activity, as well as fragmentation and macrophage inﬁltration in the aorta of the mgR/mgR mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, airspace enlargement and increased pSmad2 activity in the lungs of mgR/mgR animals were prevented by the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our ﬁndings demonstrate the important role of secondary cellular events caused by GxxPG-containing fragments and matrix-induced inﬂammatory activity in the pathogenesis of thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi>) in mgR/mgR mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the results of the current study suggest that antagonism of the effects of GxxPG fragments may be a fruitful therapeutic strategy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
