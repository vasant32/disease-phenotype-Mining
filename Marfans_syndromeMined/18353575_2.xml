<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The sudden, unexpected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of young persons from ruptured thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> is suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>), a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorder</z:e> of fibrillin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Establishing such a diagnosis is important so that the same fate might be avoided in living relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> diagnosis is difficult in the deceased but the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo>, a common morphological feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, can be established by assessing the metacarpal index (MCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MCI is routinely determined using radiographic techniques including computed radiography (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The wider availability of computed tomography (CT) in the forensic environment provides an alternative method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CT is predicted to produce measurements at least as accurate as CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study therefore were to (1) validate MCI measurements by comparing CT and CR with direct measurement using calipers on human skeletonised hands, and (2) compare cadaveric CT and CR MCI measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The metacarpals of 12 human skeleton hands were measured using CT and CR, and compared with direct measurement using calipers (the "gold standard") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifty randomly selected cadavers between 20 and 40 years had the MCI of both hands measured using CT and CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CT was found to be more accurate in the measurement of MCI than CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences in the MCIs obtained for CT and CR (females: p=0.01; males: p&lt;0.0001) and between CR and calipers (p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between MCIs obtained for CT and calipers (p=0.71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CR was found to consistently overestimate the MCI by an average of 7.97% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CT is more accurate in determination of the MCI than CR and should provide the basis for future skeletal measurements </plain></SENT>
