<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Informative polymorphisms have been very difficult to detect in the elastin gene, and this has hampered the analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heritable connective tissue disorders</z:e>, notably the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently detected a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> repeat polymorphism in intron 17 of the human elastin gene consisting of 8 alleles with sizes between 161 and 175 bp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of 540 chromosomes from unrelated Caucasian individuals revealed a bimodal frequency distribution typical of (dC<z:chebi fb="51" ids="50323">-dA</z:chebi>)n.(dG-dT)n repeat polymorphisms, with allele frequencies ranging from 0.004 (161 bp) to 0.574 (163 bp) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As the elastin gene was originally assigned to chromosome 2q31-ter and because more recent data have suggested an assignment to 7q11.1-21.1, we have genotyped a sub-set of the CEPH pedigrees and carried out pairwise linkage analysis with markers on chromosomes 7 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lod-scores of between +3.70 and +13.69 were obtained with markers spanning 7p13-q22.1, whilst negative lod-scores were observed with the chromosome 2 markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of type II human ovarian <z:hpo ids='HP_0009792'>teratomas</z:hpo> placed the elastin gene within 11 cM of the centromere on chromosome 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we detected the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> repeat in human-rodent cell hybrids containing chromosome 7, but not those containing chromosome 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data confirm the assignment of elastin to chromosome 7 and provide a new, highly informative marker for the analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heritable disorders</z:e> of connective tissue for which elastin is a candidate gene </plain></SENT>
