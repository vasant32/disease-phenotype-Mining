<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of a defined Marfan population with traditional indications for bracing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the success rate of brace treatment in keeping curves from progressing by more than 5 degrees or exceeding 45 degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Few studies exist regarding brace treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and they include many patients with curves of more than 45 degrees, as well as some who are near maturity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the prior studies risk the possibility of some selection bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were selected from support groups and several institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were: Definite diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, curve of 45 degrees or less, Risser sign 2, 1, or 0 at inception of bracing, recommended wear of 18 hours or more per day, and follow-up until maturity or surgery (minimum, 2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Success was defined as curve progression of 5 degrees or less and final curve remaining 45 degrees or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Failure was a final curve of more than 45 degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients met the criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 15 girls and 9 boys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients wore a brace as recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two additional patients were unable to tolerate it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age at inception of bracing was 8.7 years (range, 4-12 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were 14 double major, 6 thoracic, and 4 thoracolumbar curves with a mean size of 29 degrees at the beginning of bracing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The stated wearing time averaged 21 hours per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Five patients had significant pain over bony prominences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Although correction of the curve in brace was good (45%), only 4 of the patients had success, and in 20 of the 24 treatment was considered a failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Mean progression was 6 degrees +/- 8 degrees per year, for a final mean curve of 49 degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of the patients had, or were advised to have, surgical correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The difference in age and degree of curvature were not statistically significant between the success and nonsuccess groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The success rate for brace treatment of Marfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> is 17%, which is lower than that reported for idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Possible reasons include increased progressive forces, altered transmission of corrective pressure to the spine, and younger age at inception of bracing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Because there was no control group, it is unknown whether bracing slowed curve progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Physicians should understand that most patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who have a curve of more than 25 degrees and a Risser sign of 2 or less will reach the surgical range, even with brace treatment </plain></SENT>
