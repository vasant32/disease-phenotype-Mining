<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of this gene are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular remodeling and T cell activation of TGFBR2 gene suggest that the TGFBR2 gene SNPs are related to the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026691" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MLNS|MCLS">Kawasaki disease</z:e> (KD) and coronary artery lesion (CAL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects were 105 patients with KD and 500 healthy adults as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean age of KD group was 32 months age and 26.6% of those had CAL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We selected TGFBR2 gene SNPs from serum and performed direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sequences of the eleven SNPs in the TGFBR2 gene were compared between the KD group and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three SNPs (rs1495592, rs6550004, rs795430) were associated with development of KD (P=0.019, P=0.026, P=0.016, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One SNP (rs1495592) was associated with CAL in KD group (P=0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Eleven SNPs in TGFBR2 gene were identified at that time the genome wide association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>But, with the change of the data base, only six SNPs remained associated with the TGFBR2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One of the six SNPs (rs6550004) was associated with development of KD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One SNP associated with CAL (rs1495592) was disassociated from the TGFBR2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The other five SNPs were not functionally identified, but these SNPs are notable because the data base is changing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further studies involving larger group of patients with KD are needed </plain></SENT>
