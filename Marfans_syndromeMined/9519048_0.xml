<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 24 patients with aortic repair after Stanford type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> were followed up by spiral CT and MRI (0.5 Tesla) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Presence of persistent dissection, progressive or new dissection, proximal and distal anastomosis, periprosthetic space, supraaortic vessels, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the true and false lumen were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The following postoperative complications were seen: three pseudoaneurysms which developed at the proximal anastomoses of the Dacron prosthesis in two cases and at the insertion site of the reimplanted left coronary artery after implantation of a composite graft (Bentall procedure) in one case; one re-dissection; one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> of the false lumen; periprosthetic flow in one patient after surgical repair of type A dissection by the graft inclusion technique; progressive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the false lumen in 4 cases; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the aortic root in a Marfan patient after replacement of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Precise knowledge of the surgical technique performed is crucial to accurate postoperative imaging evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI is the method of choice in the postoperative follow-up of clinically stable patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
