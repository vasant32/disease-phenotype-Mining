<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the immediate and long-term results of fenestration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> malperfusion syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1999 and 2007, 35 patients (31 men; age, 57 ± 11 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (19 with type A and 16 with type B) were treated by fenestration for malperfusion syndrome (27 renal, 27 bowel, and 14 lower limb) due to dynamic compression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fenestration was performed with 2 rigid guidewires inserted in one 8F sheath (45 cm long) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean interval between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and fenestration was 5 days (28 patients within 3 days and 7 patients between 9 and 41 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fenestration (100% technical success rate) with an additional endovascular procedure (29 peripheral stents and 1 thoracic stent graft) resulted in angiographic success in 97% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bowel surgery was performed in 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mortality within the first month (12/35) was related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0156149" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel ischemia</z:e> (n = 5), neurologic complications (n = 3), type A surgery (n = 2), and late treatment (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At a mean follow-up of 48 ± 30 months, 4 of the remaining 23 patients had died and 2 had withdrawn from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the aorta, as measured using computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging, remained stable in 12 of the remaining 17 patients and had increased in 5 (1 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and 4 with multiple arterial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In emergencies, fenestration saved 69% of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> malperfusion syndrome in complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period, the aortic diameter remained stable in most of the surviving patients </plain></SENT>
