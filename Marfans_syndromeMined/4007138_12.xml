<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five patients had the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In controls the highest elastin concentrations (estimated from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37628">desmosine</z:chebi> concentrations or insoluble residues after hot-alkali extraction) were found in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During aging until 60 years, elastin concentration decreased when determined by the hot-alkali extraction method while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37628">desmosine</z:chebi> concentration changed less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aorta samples from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan-syndrome</z:e> patients showed a great variation of elastin concentration from total lack to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Samples from the other AAE patients could be divided into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One contained clearly less elastin and more collagen than the controls whereas in the other group this difference was less marked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histological examination of the aortic wall of the first group also showed marked <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> accompanied by severe elastin fragmentation and acellularity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From the 15 non-Marfan patients 14 were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By means of clinical examination these patients could also be divided into "familial" and "nonfamilial" groups, because increased diameter of the aortic root was found in relatives of almost half of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, there were no differences in elastin and collagen concentrations between the familial and nonfamilial cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As well, no correlation was found between biochemical findings and diameters of the aortic roots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results point to altered elastin and/or collagen metabolism in the aortic wall of AAE patients </plain></SENT>
