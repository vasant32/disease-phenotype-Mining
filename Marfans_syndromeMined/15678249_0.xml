<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Young adults without a history of blunt trauma who are not at risk for atherosclerotic disease may lower this suspicion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present a 24-year-old patient with complaints of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> who presented in multiple urgent care clinics and emergency departments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chest radiograph, he was repeatedly discharged home on <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesics</z:chebi> until a loud murmur was heard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An echocardiogram revealed a <z:mp ids='MP_0011575'>dilated aortic root</z:mp> with an intimal flap consistent with a type II dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After surgical aortic repair with a Bentall procedure, he was discharged with complete relief of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histologic reports revealed cystic medial degeneration </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This case illustrates the importance of cardiac auscultation when assessing an individual with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo>, even with a low likelihood for alteration in arterial structure, and the maintenance of a high index of clinical suspicion despite a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chest radiograph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We consider this case to be of interest because of its rarity in a 24-year-old </plain></SENT>
