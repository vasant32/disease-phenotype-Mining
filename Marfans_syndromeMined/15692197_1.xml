<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) is a relatively frequent systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> with an important physical morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The influences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> on physical problems, perception of severity, and impact on the quality of life and psychosocial well-being have been studied only limitedly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the association between the severity derived from the reported symptoms and subjectively experienced severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> (expressed as a global judgment), with special emphasis regarding impact on relationships and pregnancies, psychosocial adjustment, and differences between the seven European countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A questionnaire designed specifically for this study and translated in each of the native languages was sent to 2,080 members of one of the patient support groups in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>857 MFS patients of 13 years and older completed the questionnaire and were included in the data analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Physical impairments were scored by perception of severity of physical symptoms by the patients (physical severity perception score) and by their perception of the influence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> on their life (subjective severity score) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Main discrepancy between physical severity perception and subjective severity score was the higher percentage of patients scoring in physical severity perception as severe (53.5%) compared to subjectively severe (26.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>61% of those who scored on the physical severity score as severely affected were designated as being mildly-moderately affected on subjective scoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both severity scores increased significantly with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two hundred-twenty women have carried 430 pregnancies (1.95 pregnancies/woman), with cardiovascular complications in 1.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prenatal studies for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> were rejected by 7.6% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients of 25 years and older, 33.6% were undecided, and 48.5% favored prenatal diagnosis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> if available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A positive general self-image was reported by 91.5% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, more than 90% stated that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> had a negative influence on their sexual relationships, which they ascribed to negative perception of their body image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> has significant impact on daily life activities, but the majority of patients come to terms with their condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Acceptance is mainly determined by subjective severity, and less by physical symptoms as reported by the patients themselves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It is important to stimulate a positive attitude towards <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
