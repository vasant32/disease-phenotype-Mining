<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the natural history of vasculopathy of the thoracoabdominal aorta in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> after composite graft repair of the aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total 224 magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) images obtained in 48 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> over a period of 2.3-9.4 years (mean, 5.0 years) were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On each image, the diameter of the thoracoabdominal aorta was measured and the presence of dissection or major peripheral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 31 (65%) of the 48 patients, no statistically significant change (3 mm or less increase in diameter) in the diameter of the aorta occurred during the study (group 1); in the remaining 17 (35%) patients, a significant change occurred (greater than 3 mm increase) (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean initial diameter of the native aorta was slightly larger in group 2 (mean, 27 mm +/- 8 [standard deviation]) than in group 1 (mean, 23 mm +/- 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In group 1, the mean rate of dilation was 0.07 mm/y +/- 0.2; in group 2, the rate was 2.3 mm/y +/- 3.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> were in group 1, whereas 14 such patients were in group 2 (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> that involved major peripheral arteries were present in four (13%) of the 31 group 1 patients and in 12 (71%) of the 17 group 2 patients (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surgical intervention was necessary in two group 1 patients and in 14 group 2 patients (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A subset of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> manifested multiple forms of vasculopathy, including progressive <z:mp ids='MP_0010574'>aortic dilation</z:mp>, dissection, and peripheral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> after composite aortic graft repair of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with these characteristics merit more frequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> follow-up since further surgery was often necessary in these individuals </plain></SENT>
