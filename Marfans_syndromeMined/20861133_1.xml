<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The heart can be affected since valvular regurgitation is a common complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there is still debate whether a primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> exists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to evaluate the existence of a Marfan-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> using cardiovascular magnetic resonance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively evaluated 68 consecutive adult patients with no cardiovascular surgery or significant valvular regurgitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular and right ventricular volumes, ejection fraction, and mass were estimated and compared with published data on a healthy control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were also assessed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, aortic dimensions, and valve disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One quarter (25.0%) of Marfan patients had reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), with 25.0% having increased left ventricular end-diastolic and 30.8% having increased end-systolic volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The right ventricular ejection fraction was reduced in 10.3%, with increased right ventricular end-diastolic volumes in 11.8% and increased end-systolic volumes in 13.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, no association was found between reduced LVEF and age, gender, indexed aortic dimensions, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, or valve regurgitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study supports the existence of a primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in a subgroup of Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The biventricular enlargement and dysfunction is usually mild, asymptomatic, and independent from other cardiovascular manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to assess underlying causes and natural history of this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Routine monitoring and treatment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> may need to be tailored not only to prevent aortic root expansion but also to support myocardial function </plain></SENT>
