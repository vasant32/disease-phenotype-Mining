<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fibrillins and latent transforming growth factor β binding proteins (LTBPs) are components of the extracellular matrix of connective tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While fibrillins are integral to the 10nm microfibrils, and often associated with elastin, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> family members are likely to have an additional role in regulating the bioavailability of transforming growth factor β (TGBβ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both fibrillins and LTBPs are large <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi>, containing a series of calcium binding epidermal growth factor domains as well as a number of copies of a unique 8 cysteine domain found only in this protein superfamily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There are three mammalian fibrillins and four LTBPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin monomers link head to tail in microfibrils which can then form two and three dimensional structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In some tissues elastin is recruited to the fibrillin microfibrils to provide elasticity to the tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LTBPs are part of the TGBβ large latent complex which sequesters TGBβ in the extracellular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin-1 appears to bind to LTBPs to assist in this process and is thus involved in regulating the bioavailability of TGBβ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mutation of fibrillin genes results in connective tissue phenotypes which reflect both the increased level of active TGBβ and the structural failure of the extracellular matrix due to the absence or abnormality of fibrillin protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fibrillinopathies include <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo>, familial thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (mutations of FBN1) and congenital contractural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo> (mutation of FBN2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There are no diseases currently associated with mutation of FBN3 in humans, and this gene is no longer active in rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Expression patterns of fibrillin genes are consistent with their role in extracellular matrix structure of connective tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>FBN1 expression is high in most cell types of mesenchymal origin, particularly bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Human and mouse FBN2 expression is high in fetal cells and has more restricted expression in mesenchymal cell types postnatally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>FBN3 is expressed early in development (embryonic and fetal tissues) in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The fibrillins are thus important in maintaining the structure and integrity of the extracellular matrix and, in combination with their sequence family members the LTBPs, also contribute to the regulation of the TGFβ family of major growth factors </plain></SENT>
