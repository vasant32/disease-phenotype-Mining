<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We assessed the outcome in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> operated on exclusively with the aortic valve-sparing reimplantation technique for aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> during more than a decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between July 1993 and April 2005, the aortic valve-sparing reimplantation technique (David I) was used in 325 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 59 patients with clinical evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, procedures were done for aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (n = 55) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> type A (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their mean age was 30 +/- 12 years (range, 9 to 62 years), and 37 (63%) were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional procedures were arch replacement in 4 patients, coronary artery bypass grafting in 1, mitral valve surgery in 9, and closure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 54 +/- 37 months (range, 0 to 139 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No patient died during the first 30 days postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean bypass time was 163 +/- 34 minutes (range, 99 to 248 minutes), and mean aortic cross clamp time was 126 +/- 28 minutes (range, 78 to 202 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients (6.8%) required rethoracotomy for postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (8.5%) occurred during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reoperation of the reconstructed valve was required in 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Freedom from reoperation was 88% +/- 5% at 5 years and 80% +/- 9% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mean grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> was 1.81 preoperatively compared with 0.20 early postoperatively (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At last investigation, the mean grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> increased slightly to 0.22 (p = 0.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation was not required in 67% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>One thromboembolic complication and four instances of minor <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I (86%) or II at last contact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Excellent early outcome, favorable long-term results, and acceptable durability of the reimplanted valve should encourage use of this technique in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
