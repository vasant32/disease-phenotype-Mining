<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 23-year-old man was admitted to our hospital presenting severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography and cardiac catheterization studies demonstrated marked annulo-aortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> and significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> due to a ruptured chorda </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In operation, it was found that a chorda of the mitral posterior leaflet had been torn, with the leaflet completely prolapsed to the left atrium, and that the aortic root was dilated to 90 mm in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ascending aorta was extensively resected leaving those areas of aortic tissue involving the coronary ostia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then the mobilized coronary arteries were reattached to the composite graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MVR was performed with preservation of the whole anterior and posterior mitral valve apparatus except for that small part with the torn chorda </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histopathological findings of the aortic wall and mitral valve were compatible with those of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
