<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their physiological importance is underscored by the complex spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with mutations of fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) and congenital contractural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Early evidence suggested that fibrillin-1 mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> lead to loss of tissue integrity by perturbing microfibril assembly and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent studies in genetically targeted mice have however revealed that fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 mutations perturb signaling events mediated by TGF-beta superfamily members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As such, these studies have established a new biological paradigm whereby fibrillin-rich microfibrils are structural networks that specify the local concentration and timely release of signaling molecules during morphogenesis and tissue remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This review summarizes our current understanding of the role of fibrillin-rich microfibrils in development and disease, as well as exciting new applications in the clinical management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
