<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen family members, ages ranging from 3 to 47 years, were evaluated from 2006 to 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten members were found to have primary or secondary visual problems secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Evaluation of 10 members with subluxated lenses in three generations showed that the leading cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>loss of vision</z:hpo> (&lt; 20/200) was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000646'>amblyopia</z:hpo> (n = 5), followed by surgical complications (n = 2) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000646'>amblyopia</z:hpo> was observed in 8 additional eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of those with long axial length (&gt; 25 mm, n = 10), visual acuity ranged from 20/400 to 20/70 and no eyes tested better than 20/40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In eight eyes with an axial length of less than 25 mm, visual acuity ranged between counting fingers and 20/30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this group, 50% had a visual outcome of 20/40 or better </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two eyes had no light perception and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041327" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">phthisis</z:e> secondary to surgical complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 18 eyes in which axial length data were available, more eyes in the axial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo> group had unfavorable visual outcome (P = .04, Wilcoxon signed rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000646'>Amblyopia</z:hpo> due to delayed surgical intervention was the leading cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> in three generations of this family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Axial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011003'>high myopia</z:hpo> was more frequent in deeply <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002418" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">amblyopic</z:e> family members </plain></SENT>
