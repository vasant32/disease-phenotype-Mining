<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed the prospectively collected Hong Kong Health Authority's Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System and Clinical Medical System </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine (9.3%) patients had major cardiac or aortoiliac operations, with an operative mortality of 5/49 (10.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven (7.0%) patients (23 male, 14 female) died during this period, with a mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of 41.0 years (range 0-83) for males and 29.9 years (range 0-59) for females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The majority of these patients died of cardiovascular causes, with four <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo>, two ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, seven with sudden collapse and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, and five with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, there were other causes of mortality: five perioperative, one congenital, and four pulmonary causes, three with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and one of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
