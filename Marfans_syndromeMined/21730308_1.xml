<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 90 patients ≤50 years of age with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, LDS, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e>, or nonspecific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> who underwent thoracic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Controls (n=30) underwent magnetic resonance imaging to exclude arrhythmogenic right ventricular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a volume-rendered angiogram, vertebral arteries were measured along the curvature of the vessel (actual length) and linearly (straight length), and distance factor was calculated: [(actual/straight length-1)×100] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each subject's maximum distance factor was designated the Vertebral Tortuosity Index (VTI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The VTI was compared among diagnostic groups and among patients with cardiac surgery, dissection, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median age at magnetic resonance imaging was 19.6 years (range 0.2 to 50.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>VTI interrater reliability was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient =0.987) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The VTI was higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (n=57, median 26; interquartile range 10 to 49) and LDS (n=13, median 58; interquartile range 18 to 92) compared with controls (median 4.5; interquartile range 3 to 6; P&lt;0.001 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Higher VTI was associated with younger age at surgery even when controlling for root size (adjusted P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Vertebral tortuosity index ≥50 was associated with earlier age at dissection and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> compared with VTI &lt;50 (P=0.001 versus P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We found no difference in age at surgery, dissection, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> compared with LDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005116'>Arterial tortuosity</z:hpo> measured by magnetic resonance angiography is a reproducible marker of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
