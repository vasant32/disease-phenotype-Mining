<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Major clinical manifestations affect cardiovascular and skeletal apparatuses and ocular and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed FBN1 gene in 99 patients referred to our Center for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan Syndrome</z:e> and Related Disorders (University of Florence, Florence, Italy): 85 were affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and 14 by other fibrillinopathies type I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified mutations in 80 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 77 different mutational events, 46 had not been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They are represented by 49 missense (61%), 1 silent (1%), 13 nonsense (16%), 6 donor splice site mutations (8%), 8 small deletions (10%), and 3 small duplications (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of missense mutations were within the calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found preferential associations between The Cys-missense mutations and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> and premature termination codon mutations and skeletal manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to what reported in literature, the cardiovascular system is severely affected also in patients carrying mutations in exons 1-10 and 59-65 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we were able to detect FBN1 mutations in 88% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and in 36% of patients with other fibrillinopathies type I, confirming that FBN1 mutations are good predictors of classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
