<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in the absence of solid genotype-phenotype correlations, the identification of an FBN1 mutation has only little prognostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We propose a bioinformatics framework for the mutated FBN1 gene which comprises the collection, management, and analysis of mutation data identified by molecular genetic analysis (DHPLC) and data of the clinical phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To query our database at different levels of information, a relational data model, describing mutational events at the cDNA and protein levels, and the disease's phenotypic expression from two alternative views, was implemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For database similarity requests, a query model which uses a distance measure based on log-likelihood weights for each clinical manifestation, was introduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A data mining strategy for discovering diagnostic markers, classification and clustering of phenotypic expressions was provided which enabled us to confirm some known and to identify some new genotype-phenotype correlations </plain></SENT>
