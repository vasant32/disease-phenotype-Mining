<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to describe the influence of (nearly) entire aortic replacement and beta-blocking therapy on blood pressure and wave reflections in Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four Marfan patients (mean age 31+/-3 years) and 8 age matched control subjects were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure and wave reflections (reflection coefficient and augmentation index) were studied by means of magnetic resonance imaging, continuous non-invasive blood pressure measurements and applanation tonometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were studied with atenolol, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6343">labetalol</z:chebi> and without beta-blocking therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In Marfan patients, aortic systolic pressure (129+/-13 vs 114+/-10 mmHg), pulse pressure (58+/-13 vs 40+/-5 mmHg), wave speed (11+/-3 vs 4+/-0.4 m s(-1)) and reflection coefficient (65+/-22 vs 41+/-5%) were significantly increased compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in aortic pressure between various medications in Marfan patients (atenolol 129/76 mmHg, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6343">labetalol</z:chebi> 121/75 mmHg and without beta-blocking therapy 129/71 mmHg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher reflection coefficients were seen in patients with atenolol compared to discontinued medication (73+/-18 vs 65+/-22%), and also the augmentation index was higher with atenolol compared to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6343">labetalol</z:chebi> and discontinued medication (24+/-22 vs 17+/-17 vs 22+/-22%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results describe <z:mp ids='MP_0006265'>increased pulse pressure</z:mp>, systolic pressure, wave speed and wave reflections in four Marfan patients after entire aortic replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The use of atenolol or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6343">labetalol</z:chebi> did not decrease aortic pressure and with atenolol increased wave reflections were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the beneficial effect of atenolol in these patients is doubtful </plain></SENT>
