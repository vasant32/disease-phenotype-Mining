<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: The root replacement (RR) method for insertion of the pulmonary autograft (PA) has resulted in improved immediate aortic valve competence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the unsupported pulmonary artery wall is thinner, more elastic, and thus more prone to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This might predispose to late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> (AR) due to splaying of the aortic commissures, similar to the mechanism of AR in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A fully supported root replacement (FSRR) method was designed and implemented in 78 patients, with preservation of the aortic root and proximal ascending aortic remnant fully to surround and support the PA root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional aortic annulus reduction was performed in 29 patients, and adjustment of the sinotubular diameter in 27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients were analyzed with sequential Doppler echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The maximal neoaortic sinus diameter remained constant for up to three years after surgery (mean 34.3 +/- 4.0 mm) compared with before surgery (35.2 +/- 4.0 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was one early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, no late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> or reoperations, and at last follow up AR was nil/trivial in 72% of patients, mild in 27% and moderate in 1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no progression of AR over four years' follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By comparison, four patients previously underwent unsupported RR for insertion of the PA; in these patients, mean neoaortic sinus diameter increased significantly from 31 +/- 6 mm to 41 +/- 3 mm at three years after surgery (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Insertion of the PA using a FSRR method prevents <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the neoaortic sinuses and sinotubular junction without need for prosthetic material, and provides similar results to conventional RR with regard to aortic valve competence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Retaining the advantages of RR in this manner and maintaining aortic root size may prove valuable in the longer term </plain></SENT>
