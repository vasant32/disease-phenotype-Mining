<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> which occurred during general anaesthesia in the prone position for surgical correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0008454'>lumbar kyphosis</z:hpo> in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Peroperative monitoring was routine with ECG, non-invasive arterial pressure, oximetry, PETCO2 and central venous pressure, plus aortic blood flow and and systolic time intervals via an oesophageal echo-Doppler device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-five minutes after the start of surgery, a sudden decrease in aortic blood flow followed by a decrease in PETCO2 suggested <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> despite continuation of the ECG signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initial CPR in the prone position produced a slight increase in PETCO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the patient was turned to the supine position and the legs elevated, chest compression was more efficient and spontaneous circulation was rapidly restored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Circulatory arrest</z:e> could be explained by incompletely treated hypovolaemia, or by myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (decrease in aortic blood flow and lengthened pre-ejection period) combined with excessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, thus compromising coronary blood flow producing ST segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Continuous non-invasive aortic blood flow and PETCO2 monitoring proved valuable in the early detection and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> and in the evaluation of the efficiency of peroperative CPR </plain></SENT>
