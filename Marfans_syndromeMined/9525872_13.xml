<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A mutation that changes a highly conserved Gly residue to Ser in this domain has been identified both in the factor IX (FIX) and fibrillin-1 genes, where it is associated with relatively mild variants of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0684275,C0019069" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemophilia</z:e> B and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the structural consequences in vitro of this amino acid change when introduced into single cbEGF domains from human FIX (G60S) and human fibrillin-1 (G1127S), and a covalently linked pair of cbEGF domains from fibrillin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High pressure liquid chromatography analysis, mass spectrometry, and 1H NMR analysis demonstrate that <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> cbEGF domains purified in the reduced form and refolded in vitro adopt the native fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the<z:chebi fb="1" ids="32722"> Gly --</z:chebi>&gt; Ser change causes defective folding of FIX and fibrillin-1 cbEGF domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in the case of the factor IX mutant domain, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-dependent change in conformation, identified by NMR in a proportion of the refolded material, suggests that some material refolds to a native-like structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis of FIX G60S from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0684275,C0019069" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemophilia</z:e> B patient Oxford d2, which demonstrates that the mutant protein is partially recognized by a monoclonal antibody specific for this region of FIX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NMR analysis of a covalently linked pair of fibrillin cbEGF domains demonstrates that the C-terminal domain adopts the native epidermal growth factor fold, despite the fact that the adjacent mutant domain is misfolded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The implications of these results for disease pathogenesis are discussed </plain></SENT>
