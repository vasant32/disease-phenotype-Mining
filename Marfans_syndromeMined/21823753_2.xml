<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Murine models of disease are a powerful tool for researchers to gain insight into disease formation, progression, and therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The biomechanical indicators of diseased tissue provide a unique insight into some of these murine models, since the biomechanical properties in scenarios such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> can dictate tissue failure and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Understanding the properties of the tissue on the macroscopic scale has been shown to be important, as one can then understand the tissue's ability to withstand the high stresses seen in the cardiac pulsatile cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Alterations in the biomechanical response can foreshadow prospective mechanical failure of the tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These alterations are often seen on the microstructural level, and obtaining detailed information on such changes can offer a better understanding of the phenomena seen on the macroscopic level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, mouse models present problems due to the size and delicate features in the mechanical testing of such tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, some smaller arteries in large-animal studies (e.g., coronary and cerebral arteries) can present the same issues, and are sometimes unsuitable for planar biaxial testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this paper is to present a robust method for the investigation of the mechanical properties of small arteries and the classification of the microstructural orientation and degree of fiber alignment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This occurs through the cost-efficient modification of a planar biaxial tester that works in conjunction with a two-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> nonlinear microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This system provides a means to further investigate how microstructure and mechanical properties are modified in diseased transgenic animals where the tissue is in small tube form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Several other hard-to-test tubular specimens such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> arteries and atherosclerotic coronary arteries can also be tested using the described modular device </plain></SENT>
