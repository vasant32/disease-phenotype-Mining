<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Correction of adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> frequently involves long segmental fusions, but controversy still exists whether these fusions should include the sacrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that forces associated with activities of daily living transfer the stresses to the remaining levels of the spine and to the pelvis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The case described here was a 43-year-old woman with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo> refractory to non-surgical modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Radiographically, the patient had a 110 degree lumbar curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An anterior and posterior fusion with Luque-Galveston instrumentation was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six months postoperatively the patient returned with a 2-week history of right hip pain with no history of trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was radiographic evidence of a displaced femoral neck fracture and pubic rami fractures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The femoral neck fracture was treated with a total hip replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further surgeries were required to correct a lumbar <z:hpo ids='HP_0005864'>pseudoarthrosis</z:hpo> and hardware failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We believe that this case provides evidence that fusion into the lumbosacral junction may distribute forces through the pelvic bones and hip resulting in stress and potential hardware complications, especially in patients at risk due to osteopenic conditions </plain></SENT>
