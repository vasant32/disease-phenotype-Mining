<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The girls were double second cousins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One of the girls also had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000062'>ambiguous genitalia</z:hpo>, an anomaly not generally associated with this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two children were both the product of first-cousin Bedouin parents from the same family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is possible that both sets of parents were heterozygous for CCA; thus the infants may have been homozygous for CCA, which is usually an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No instance of homozygous CCA has previously been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This family suggests <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> in CCA and that, in some rare families, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> may be <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
