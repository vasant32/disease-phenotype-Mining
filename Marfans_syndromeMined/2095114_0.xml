<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1980 to December 1989, the Bentall and De Bono technique was employed in 38 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of ascending aorta with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo>; 14 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four patients were operated on previously by other techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The immediate mortality was 5.2%; one patient due to low-output syndrome and one had neurological complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients (13.1%) died late postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The surviving 31 patients were followed up from two to 72 months (mean 25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, 29 (93.5%) were in functional class I and two in class II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients had late evaluation by one or more of the following methods: digital angiography, chest computerized tomography, echocardiography, or conventional angiography, 6 to 60 (mean 33) months after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them had good conditions of composite valve graft and coronary artery reattachment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The immediate and late results were similar in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The aortic valve and aortic ascending portion replacement with reimplantation of coronary arteries is of low mortality and fairly good late outcome </plain></SENT>
