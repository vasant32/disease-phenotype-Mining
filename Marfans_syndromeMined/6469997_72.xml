<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied tissue and cultured skin fibroblasts from a newborn with the lethal perinatal form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029434" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteogenesis imperfecta</z:e> born to a mother with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and her unrelated husband </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dermis from the infant was thinner and fibril diameter smaller than control; dermal fibroblastic cells had dilated endoplasmic reticulum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>His fibroblasts in culture synthesized two different species of pro alpha 1(I) chains in about equal quantity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One chain was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, the other contained cysteine within the triple-helical portion of the COOH-terminal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29306,29308">cyanogen</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="25" ids="15858">bromide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> alpha 1(I)CB6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecules which contained two copies of the mutant chain formed alpha 1(I)-dimers linked through interchain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bonds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Molecules which contained either one or two mutant chains were delayed in secretion and underwent excessive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32568">lysyl</z:chebi> hydroxylation and hydroxylysyl glycosylation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> chains in the molecule, probably as a result of delayed triple-helix formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Molecules containing either one or two copies of the mutant chain melted at 38 degrees C instead of 41 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most likely explanation for these findings is that a cysteine is substituted for a glycine in the triple-helical domain of the products of one of the alpha 1(I) alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Such a substitution would interfere with triple-helix formation and stability and thus explain 1) the decreased melting temperature, 2) the increased post-translational modification, 3) the altered rate of secretion and accumulation of intracellular material, 4) the increased intracellular degradation of newly synthesized collagen, and 5) the decreased collagen production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since neither parental cell strain produced the same mutant chain, the findings are best explained by a new mutation in one of the alpha 1(I) genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The role of the uncharacterized "Marfan" gene in modifying the phenotype in this patient is unclear </plain></SENT>
