<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 29-year-old patient with calcification of the mitral valve annulus with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and severe malformation of the chest is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are 8 other cases with calcification of the mitral annulus in this syndrome in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It seems to be a specific but rare cardiac manifestation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> with calcification occurring also in the younger age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients, in contrast to other patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> who mostly have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral insufficiency</z:hpo> of minor degree mainly in late systole, present with hemodynamically severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our patient died 7 weeks after implantation of a prosthetic valve in low output syndrome, probably caused by a paraprosthetic leak and newly developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It therefore seems that indication for prosthetic replacement of the mitral valve in these patients should be made with caution, particularly in regard to the technical difficulties at operation </plain></SENT>
