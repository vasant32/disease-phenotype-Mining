<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its impact on the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e> in humans is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An extensive review of the scientific literature from the 1800s until the present time was performed to examine the common pathways between animal and human lathyrism and genetically triggered thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and cardiovascular conditions in humans, with special focus on the identification of potential therapeutic targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Search areas covered the following subjects: lathyrism/spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>/rupture in animals; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27413">beta-aminopropionitrile</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28306">semicarbazide</z:chebi> and their effects; collagen and elastin synthesis and cross-linking; genetic and molecular biology characteristics of the genetically triggered thoracic aortic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Search results demonstrate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> as a model for the genetically triggered thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo>, has been linked to mutations of the fibrillin-1 gene, via transforming growth factor beta-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several other conditions do not share this mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28306">semicarbazide</z:chebi>-sensitive <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> oxidase [vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> protein-1 (VAP-1)] in animals has been shown to result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> due to disruption of elastin cross-linking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significantly low activity of this enzyme was identified in annulo-aortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath>; a condition similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the precise molecular and genetic pathways responsible for the clinical findings in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and related conditions remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Observational and experimental findings relating to the vascular and systemic effects of molecular pathways implicated in the phenomenon of animal and human lathyrism suggest that VAP-1 seems to be involved in the molecular and developmental pathways of the genetically triggered thoracic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic diseases</z:e> and thus could be a potential therapeutic target for these conditions </plain></SENT>
