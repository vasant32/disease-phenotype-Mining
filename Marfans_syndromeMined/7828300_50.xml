<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Development of surgical therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and dissections has led to treatment of the life-threatening cardiovascular complications associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study determines the effect of surgical therapy on the life expectancy of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and the clinical course of these patients after <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Medical records were reviewed on 192 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who underwent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> repair during the past 26 years; 103 patients were interviewed, and complete preoperative and postoperative medical information was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival curves were generated, and data were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median cumulative probability of survival was 61 years, significantly increased compared with the median survival of 47 years for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> determined 30 years ago (P &lt; .0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients (53%) had second surgeries to repair subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> or dissections at other sites, the vast majority of which involved the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> repair was proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> repair, followed by descending thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The following variables predicted patients requiring second vascular surgeries: presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection at the time of the first surgery, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> after the first surgery, and a history of smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The life expectancy of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> undergoing surgical repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> has improved and is consistent with increased survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After initial repair of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo>, a significant number of patients have subsequent surgeries at other sites throughout the aorta, indicating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is a disease involving the entire aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients who had a dissection at the time of the first aortic surgery were more likely to require subsequent aortic surgery than were patients who underwent prophylactic composite graft repair of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
