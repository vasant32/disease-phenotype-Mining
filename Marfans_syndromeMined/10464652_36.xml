<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutation detection in this large gene of 65 exons is a considerable technical challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To develop an efficient method capable of identifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> possible mutations in this gene, we have explored the use of a novel denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This technique compares two or more chromosomes as a mixture of denatured and reannealed PCR amplicons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Under partially denaturing conditions, heteroduplexes can be separated from homoduplexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A panel of 94 DNA samples from individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> or related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> was screened exon-by-exon by this method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 66 unique heteroduplex profiles was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of the amplicons detected 37 novel and two previously reported mutations, as well as 15 novel and 10 known polymorphisms or unique sequence variants that are probably of no clinical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 34 mutations found in definitive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> cases, 16 were identified in the 21 samples that had not been screened before (76% detection rate) and 17/40 (43%) were in samples previously screened by other mutation detection methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 32 individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>-related phenotypes, five FBN1 mutations were identified (16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate the power of the DHPLC method to detect FBN1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It should be applicable for mutation screening in any gene in a large population </plain></SENT>
