<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: The major cardiovascular manifestations of thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> (TAAD) include: (1) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the ascending thoracic aorta at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva or ascending aorta or both; and (2) dissections of the thoracic aorta involving either the ascending (Stanford type A dissections) or descending aorta (Stanford type B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rarely an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> involving the descending thoracic aorta is observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular manifestations can be the only findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the absence of surgical repair of the ascending aorta, affected individuals typically have progressive enlargement of the ascending aorta leading to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> and presentation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> are highly variable, as are the other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: TAAD is diagnosed using different imaging modalities such as echocardiography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Up to 20% of individuals with TAAD have a first-degree relative with thoracic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Familial TAAD (FTAAD) is diagnosed based on the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and/or dissection of the thoracic aorta, absence of clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, or vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e>, and presence of a positive family history of TAAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TGFBR2, TGFBR1, MYH11, ACTA2, and two loci on other chromosomes, AAT1 (FAA1) and AAT2 (TAAD1), are associated with familial TAAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rarely, FTAAD can also be caused by FBN1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further locus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> is evident: to date, only about 20% of familial TAAD is accounted for by mutations in known genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Molecular genetic testing for TGFBR1, TGFBR2, MYH11, FBN1, and ACTA2 is available clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Medications that reduce hemodynamic stress, such as beta adrenergic blocking agents, are recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>When the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005111'>dilation of the ascending aorta</z:hpo> approaches 0.5 cm per year or the diameter is between 4.2 and 5.0 cm (depending on the underlying mutation or family history) elective repair of the ascending aorta is recommended to prevent a life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> or rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Early prophylactic repair should be considered in individuals with confirmed mutations in TGFBR2 and TGFBR1 and/or a family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> with minimal aortic enlargement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Surveillance: Appropriate imaging studies (echocardiography, CT, or MRI) should be performed at frequent intervals to monitor the status of the affected segment of the thoracic aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Imaging for additional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> is based on the gene that is mutated and/or family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Agents/circumstances to avoid: Uncontrolled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, smoking, isometric exercise, bodybuilding/weight training exercises, and competitive sports that could lead to a significant blow to the chest should be avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Testing of relatives at risk: Aortic imaging is recommended for first-degree relatives of individuals with TAAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Because of the variability of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of TAAD, aortic imaging once a year or every few years is warranted for at-risk relatives in families with inherited or familial TAAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>If the disease-causing mutation is known, genetic counseling and testing of at-risk first-degree relatives assures that only relatives with the familial mutation undergo aortic imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>GENETIC COUNSELING: Familial TAAD is primarily inherited in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> manner with variable expression and decreased penetrance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The majority of individuals with familial TAAD have an affected parent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The children of an affected parent have an up to 50% chance of inheriting the genetic predisposition to TAAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the disease-causing mutation in the family is known </plain></SENT>
