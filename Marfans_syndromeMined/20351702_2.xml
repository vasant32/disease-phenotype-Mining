<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Improvements in surgical techniques have facilitated prophylactic surgery and have dramatically changed the life expectancy of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Valve-sparing techniques are becoming the standard surgical treatment for these patients, since the operative and long-term results are comparable with those obtained with the Bentall and De Bono procedure and their theoretical advantages over the Bentall and De Bono procedure are attractive for young patients </plain></SENT>
