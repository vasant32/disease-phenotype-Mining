<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene on chromosome 15 (FBN1) have been reported to cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have now screened 44 probands with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> or related phenotypes for alterations in the entire fibrillin coding sequence (9.3 kb) by single strand conformation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report four unique mutations in the fibrillin gene of unrelated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One is a 17 bp deletion and three are missense mutations, two of which involve 8-cysteine motifs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another missense mutation was found in two unrelated individuals with annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> but was also present in unaffected relatives and controls from various ethnic backgrounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By using allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization, we screened 65 unrelated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients, 29 patients with related phenotypes and 84 control individuals for these mutations as well as for a previously reported mutation and two polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> families carry unique mutations and that the fibrillin genotype is not the sole determinant of the connective tissue phenotype </plain></SENT>
