<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Aortic valve sparing is frequently performed to treat patients with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, but there is an inadequate amount of information regarding its long-term durability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examines the long-term results of reimplantation of the aortic valve in patients with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From August 1989 to December 2010, 296 consecutive patients had reimplantation of the aortic valve into a tubular Dacron graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their mean age was 45 years (range, 11-79 years), and 78% were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the patients, 36% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and 11% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed prospectively with periodic images of the aortic root and remaining aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 6.9 ± 4.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 21 patients at risk at 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 4 operative and 18 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The survival at 5, 10, and 15 years was 95.1% ± 3.5%, 93.1% ± 4.4%, and 76.5% ± 18%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only 3 patients required reoperation on the aortic valve; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 patients had the Bentall procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Freedom from reoperation at 5, 10, and 15 years was 99.7% ± 2.0%, 97.8% ± 5.3%, and 97.8% ± 5.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> developed in 9 patients, and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> developed in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Freedom from moderate or severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> at 5, 10, and 15 years was 98.3% ± 3.5%, 92.9% ± 6.5%, and 89.4% ± 12%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The function of the aortic valve implanted inside a tubular Dacron graft remains <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at 15 years in most patients after this type of aortic valve-sparing operation </plain></SENT>
