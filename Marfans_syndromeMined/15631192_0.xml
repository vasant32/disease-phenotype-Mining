<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are composed of two elements: protein-elastin and microfibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tissue rich in elastin include: aorta and major vessels, lungs, ligaments, tendons and skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Elastases are a group of enzymes, which are able to degrade elastin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They are liberated from different cells including granulocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes, skin fibroblasts, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells and others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The product of elastin degradation is known as elastin-derived <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (EDP) and is a marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306863" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elastolysis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Elastin-derived <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> are thought to act on elastin-laminin receptor (ELR), which is located on membrane of fibroblasts, granulocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes and' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An increased elastin turnover can occur in several disorders, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, but its role is not well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There are a group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inherited diseases</z:e> affecting elastic fibres e.g. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It seems, that elastin degradation plays an important role in pathogenesis of some cardiovascular and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An enhanced elastolytic activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> is also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The data are rather sparse and above <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> concern lung and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
