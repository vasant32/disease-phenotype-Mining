<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study was carried out to evaluate the early and long-term outcomes of aortic root replacement over a 10-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 83 patients with a mean age of 43.2 +/- 14 years (range, 10 to 78 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> were found in 28% and 24%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most common technique used for repair of this condition was the Bentall operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of follow-up was 29.6 +/- 28 months, ranging from 1 to 120 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hospital (30-day) mortality was 13.3% (11 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients died during the late follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mortality was significantly higher in patients presenting with cardiogenic shock, those with long cardiopulmonary bypass and crossclamp times, and the group who had concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Emergency operation was not a significant risk factor for early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common complications were <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and neurological sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Aortic root replacement can be achieved with acceptable mortality and morbidity in a high-risk group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Improvements in the outcome may be achieved by faster transport of patients in cardiogenic shock, and by reducing the cardiopulmonary bypass and crossclamp times </plain></SENT>
