<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we review existing published participation guidelines and analyze emerging data from ongoing registries and population-based studies pertaining to return-to-play decisions for cardiac conditions specifically affecting adult athletes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Considerations related to return-to-play decisions will vary according to age of the athlete, with inherited disorders being the main consideration in younger adult athletes aged 18 to 40 yr, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> being the main consideration in older adult athletes aged 40 yr and older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although this arbitrary division is based on the epidemiology of underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> in these populations, the essential return-to-play decision process for both age groups is quite similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the most widely used guidelines to make return-to-play decisions in this group of athletes are the 36th Bethesda Conference Eligibility Recommendations for Competitive Athletes with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001626'>Cardiovascular Abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These have long been considered the "gold standard" for determining return-to-play decisions in young athletes in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other guidelines are available for unique purposes, including The European Society of Cardiology guidelines, and the American Heart Association published recommendations regarding participation of young patients (younger than 40 yr) with genetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> in recreational sports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The latter are consistent with the 36th Bethesda guidelines and cover common genetically based diseases such as inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1720983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">channelopathy</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The consensus on masters athletes (older than 40 yr) provides return-to-play decisions for a wide variety of conditioned states, from elite older athletes to walk-up athletes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For any adult athlete with a cardiac condition, return-to-play decisions following use of medications, ablation procedures, device implantation, corrective surgery, or coronary intervention depend on whether the procedure has sufficiently altered the risk for sudden cardiac events, and whether there is a potential for unfavorable interaction with cardiac performance </plain></SENT>
