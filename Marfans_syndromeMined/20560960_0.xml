<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutational analysis of the FBN1 and FBN2 genes excluded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and congenital contractural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MMP2 gene sequence analysis excluded multicentric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002797'>osteolysis</z:hpo>, nodulosis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003040'>arthropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lack of mutations within the MAGP2 gene also excluded an MAGP2-associated disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to establish the mechanistic basis for the severe skin pathology noted in this patient, we performed transcriptional profiling of dermal fibroblasts, and candidate gene expression studies in conjunction with immunocytochemistry and cell-based and functional assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data from these experiments have further excluded any previously recognized fibrotic disorder and identified a unique pattern of gene expression in this patient consistent with progressive <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pathogenic mechanisms included persistent proliferation of dermal fibroblasts in coexistence with a disarray of the microfibrillar network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collagen accumulation, moreover, could be linked to extensive crosslinking resulting from increased activities of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32568">lysyl</z:chebi> oxidases (LOX and LOXL), and lack of remodelling due to deficiencies in collagenolytic matrix metalloproteinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The disorder may represent a novel syndrome in which transforming growth factor-Î²1-independent dermal <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, unlike known microfibrillar disorders caused by single gene deficiencies, associates with a disarray of the microfibrillar network </plain></SENT>
