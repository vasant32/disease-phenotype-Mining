<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Another member of the fibrillin family, the FBN1 gene, is involved in a broad phenotypic continuum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective-tissue disorders</z:e> including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Identifying not only what is in common but also what differentiates these two proteins should enable us to better comprehend their respective functions and better understand the multitude of diseases in which these two genes are involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 1995 we created a locus-specific database (LSDB) for FBN1 mutations with the Universal Mutation Database (UMD) tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To facilitate comparison of identified mutations in these two genes and search for specific functional areas, we created an LSDB for the FBN2 gene: the UMD-FBN2 database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This database lists 26 published and six newly identified mutations that mainly comprise missense and splice-site mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the number of described FBN2 mutations was low, the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001373'>joint dislocation</z:hpo> was significantly higher with missense mutations when compared to splice site mutations </plain></SENT>
