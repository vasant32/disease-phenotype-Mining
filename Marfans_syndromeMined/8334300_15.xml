<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pattern of labeling, established using both whole-mounted and sectioned embryos, showed a striking localization at the primary axis of the early embryo, including Hensen's node </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After stage 8, the labeling of Hensen's node diminished while other structures in the embryo exhibited increased immunolabeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These structures include the region of the presumptive dorsal aorta, the ventral surface of the notochord, and the mesocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Injections of the antibody between the vitelline membrane and the blastoderm in vivo failed to perturb the development of embryos, thus precluding any conclusions regarding the function of fibrillin </plain></SENT>
