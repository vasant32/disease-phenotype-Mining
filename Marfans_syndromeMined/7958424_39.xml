<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A restricted population of endothelial cells lining the atrioventricular (AV) canal and proximal outflow tract (OT) transforms into mesenchyme, the reputed progenitor of the valves and membranous septa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The remainder of the cells lining these and other regions of the heart, in particular the ventricle, stay epithelial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the present time there is no information regarding the determinants for endothelial cell diversity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate the molecular basis for functionally distinct endothelial cell populations, we undertook a search for cell surface proteins within the endocardial cushions of Day 4 chicken embryos that might be sensitive to subtle differences in endothelial cell composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We theorized that monoclonal antibodies raised against proteins expressed during early valve morphogenesis could provide markers for endothelial subpopulations, thereby assisting our efforts in defining, and determining the origin of, endothelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the present study, an in vitro collagen gel culture assay was employed to identify an antibody, JB3, that distinguishes between AV/OT endothelium and ventricular endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on this assay, JB3-positive material was associated only with AV/OT endothelia or the mesenchyme derived from these epithelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, a network of JB3-positive fibrillar material was observed within the collagen gel surrounding the explanted cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The JB3 antigen showed a conspicuous distribution in pregastrulation-stage chicken embryos with immunolabeling observed in the initial primitive streak at 5 hr incubation (stage 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subsequent detection in the definitive primitive streak, Hensen's mode, and notochord indicate a consistent relationship to midline structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>JB3 antigen also localized to the regions of presumptive precardiac mesoderm and, at later stages, neural crest, somites, and ventral mesocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the JB3 antigen may play a role in establishing cardiac endothelial diversity by defining a subpopulation of cells destined to participate in valve formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, JB3 may also influence formation of the primary axis and mesoderm structures that form at the midline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Immunochemical analyses showed that JB3 recognizes a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> that migrates near the molecular weight position of fibrillin (350-390 kDa), the extracellular matrix protein linked to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Based on the molecular mass and similar immunostaining patterns in early embryos, we propose that the JB3 antigen is a fibrillin isotype or a fibrillin-associated protein </plain></SENT>
