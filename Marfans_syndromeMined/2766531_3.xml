<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This therapy resulted in mitral valve replacement in 13, aortic valve replacement in 135, aortic segment replacement in 151 (including total aortic replacement in 10), nearly total aortic replacement in 26, entire thoracic aortic replacement in seven, and replacement of the entire descending and abdominal aorta in 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The early (30-day) survival was 94%, and the 5- and 10-year Kaplan-Meier survival was 75% and 56%, respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic dissection</z:hpo> occurred in 102 (67%) patients, and 34 (22%) patients with ascending aortic operations required reoperation </plain></SENT>
