<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Arterial stiffness, which has independent predictive value for cardiovascular events, seems to have a genetic component, largely independent of the influence of blood pressure and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In animal models of essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats), structural modifications of the arterial wall include an increase in the number of elastin-smooth muscle cell connections and smaller fenestrations of the internal elastic lamina, possibility leading to redistribution of the mechanical load towards elastic materials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These modifications may give rise to mechanisms explaining why changes in arterial wall material accompanying wall <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> in these animals are not associated with an increase in arterial stiffness </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Such studies have highlighted the role of extracellular matrix signalling in the vascular wall and have shown that elastin and collagen not only display elasticity or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo>, but are also involved in the control of smooth muscle cell function </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data provide strong evidence that arterial stiffness is affected by the amount and density of stiff wall material and the spatial organization of that material </plain></SENT>
