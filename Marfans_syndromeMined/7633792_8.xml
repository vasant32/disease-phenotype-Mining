<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although radiological studies suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000938'>osteopenia</z:hpo>, investigations utilizing measurements of bone mass have yielded conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To address this question further, we measured bone mineral density (BMD) in 14 women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> at the right hip and lumbar spine by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results were compared with the age- and weight-matched reference population supplied by the DXA manufacturer, and with our own control population of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> women, the latter being matched for height, in addition to age and weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that BMD was very similar in our Marfan women as compared with the two reference populations, at the lumbar spine and femoral neck, while trochanteric BMD was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship between an isolated reduction in trochanteric BMD and future fracture risk is unclear, and, on the basis of our results, we conclude that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is not associated with a clinically significant increase in the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteoporotic fracture</z:e> </plain></SENT>
