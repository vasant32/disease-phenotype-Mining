<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed our experience of total arch replacement combined with stented elephant trunk implantation for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> with type A dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between April 2003 and September 2008, 44 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> = 19, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> = 25) with type A dissection underwent this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postoperative computed tomography was used to evaluate <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and absorption of the residual false lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In-hospital mortality was 4.55% (2/44) (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> = 0%, 0/19; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> = 8.00%, 2/25) and follow-up <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 4.76% (2/42) (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> = 5.26%, 1/19; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> = 4.35%, 1/23) during a mean follow-up of 38 Â± 17 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient (5.26%, 1/19) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection underwent thoracoabdominal aortic replacement 7 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Injury to the spinal cord and visceral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were not observed during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Obliteration of the false lumen around the stented elephant trunk was observed in 76.2% of patients (32/42) (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> = 84.2%, 16/19; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> = 69.6%, 16/23) as demonstrated by postoperative computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The distal end of the stent-graft entering the false lumen was observed in 4 patients (21.1%, 4/19) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The procedure was a suitable alternative to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type A dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, more attention should be paid to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection caused by the fragile dissecting membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>If this procedure was adopted in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection, an entry adjacent to the distal end of the surgical stent-graft, a small true lumen, or an extremely tortuous <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the false lumen aorta should be excluded </plain></SENT>
