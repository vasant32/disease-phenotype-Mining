<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventeen of the patients were also evaluated by echocardiography, and 14 had angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 11 patients, MRI demonstrated lesions that echocardiography either failed to visualize or found inconclusive, including supravalvar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> (one patient), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001680'>coarctation of the aorta</z:hpo> (three patients) hypoplastic aortic arch (one patient), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004971'>pulmonary artery hypoplasia</z:hpo> or stenosis (six patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI complemented echocardiographic diagnosis in four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and in one with coarctation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One mild recurrent coarctation demonstrated angiographically was not visualized by MRI or echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The eight other angiographic studies of the aorta confirmed MRI findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six MRI studies of the pulmonary arteries, obstructive lesions were revealed that had not been completely visualized on echocardiography or angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MRI is an excellent noninvasive method of depicting congenital abnormalities of the great arteries and may provide otherwise unobtainable information </plain></SENT>
