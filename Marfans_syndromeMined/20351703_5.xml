<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This gene encodes fibrillin-1, a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> that is the main constituent of the microfibrils of the extracellular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most mutations are unique and affect a single amino acid of the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reduced or abnormal fibrillin-1 leads to tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, increased transforming growth factor beta signaling, <z:mp ids='MP_0000340'>loss of cell</z:mp>-matrix interactions, and, finally, to the different phenotypic manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since the description of FBN1 as the gene affected in patients with this disorder, great advances have been made in the understanding of its pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The development of several mouse models has also been crucial to our increased understanding of this disease, which is likely to change the treatment and the prognosis of patients in the coming years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the many different clinical manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, cardiovascular involvement deserves special consideration, owing to its impact on prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the diagnosis of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> should be made according to Ghent criteria and requires a comprehensive clinical assessment of multiple organ systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Genetic testing can be useful in the diagnosis of selected cases </plain></SENT>
