<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Surgical results for Stanford type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> were retrospectively compared between the subtotal prosthetic replacement of the thoracoabdominal dissected aorta (STR) and partial replacement of the descending aorta at the intimal tear (PR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two patients (11 males and 11 females with mean age of 56.9+/-2.6 years) undergoing repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> operations were performed with the aid of femorofemoral partial cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reconstruction of the critical artery for spinal cord blood supply was determined by evoked spinal cord potential (ESP) monitoring in non-urgent cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Operative mortality and incidence of complications were compared between the PR group (Group I; n=15) and the STR group (Group II; n=7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were one operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and one late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in Group I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No early or late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred in Group II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> occurred in 1 patient in Group I and 2 patients in Group II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among patients undergoing selective reconstruction of the critical intercostal arteries, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> occurred in only one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Incidence of postoperative complications was not significantly different between Group I and Group II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Presence of rupture (p&lt;0.001) and development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> (p&lt;0.05) revealed significant determinants of postoperative mortality by multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Operative procedure did not influence postoperative mortality or occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Operative results of STR with selective reconstruction of the critical arteries and PR for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Subtotal replacement of the thoracoabdominal dissected aorta is encouraged to apply for patients with diffuse, large postdissection <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> or those with a high risk of future enlargement of remaining false channels such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, under adequate reconstruction of the critical segmental arteries </plain></SENT>
