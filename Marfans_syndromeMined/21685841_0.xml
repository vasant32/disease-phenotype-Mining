<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Due to the advances in cardiovascular care of children born with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (CHD), the population of adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (ACHD) has increased substantially over the past 60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the number of women with CHD who reach child-bearing age has also increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With this reality comes the responsibility to educate these women on factors that would decrease the likelihood of an adverse outcome during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is well known that pregnancy may result in circulatory changes that could adversely affect the health status of a healthy patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a patient with CHD, with or without repair, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> change in circulatory burden could increase adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Certain lesions are considered to be high risk (e.g., patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo>), based on anecdotal evidence and small case study reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most advice given to patients with intermediate risk lesions (i.e., Fontan operation, <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>transposition of great arteries</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001575'>cyanotic</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo>) are based on theoretical determination of risk, and there are few studies done to validate these recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This review serves to summarize the literature findings and make current recommendations on managing pregnancy in patients with CHD </plain></SENT>
