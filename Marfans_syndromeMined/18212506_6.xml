<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Occurrence of disease complications in the abdominal aorta in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> caused by mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin-1, is relatively rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> could affect the structure, vasomotor function and mechanical property of the abdominal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Abdominal aorta from mice at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of age, heterozygous for the Fbn1 allele encoding a cysteine substitution (Fbn1(C1039G/+), Marfan mice, n = 50), were compared with those from age-matched control littermates (n = 50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Marfan abdominal aorta demonstrated pronounced elastic fiber degradation and disorganization, concomitant with an increased aortic stiffness during aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the isometric force measurement, vasoconstriction in response to membrane depolarization or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> stimulation was similar in both Marfan and control abdominal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, Marfan abdominal aorta was less sensitive to the inhibition of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi>-induced contraction by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> and SQ-29548, during which the release of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> A(2) was one half of that of the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the protein expression of cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 detected by Western immunoblotting was not different between the 2 strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> affected abdominal aorta with respect to matrix elastic fiber organization, aortic stiffness and release of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> A(2) </plain></SENT>
