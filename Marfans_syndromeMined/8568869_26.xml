<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their importance is emphasised by the identification of mutations in these domains in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0684275" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haemophilia</z:e> B (defective in coagulation factor IX) and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (defective in the connective tissue protein fibrillin-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The X-ray crystal structure of a single <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> binding EGF-like domain from human coagulation factor IX has recently been solved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It shows that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> ligands form a pentagonal bipyramid, where one ligand is provided by an adjacent (N-terminal) EGF-like domain in the crystal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The N and C termini of the neighbouring domains are only approximately 4 angstrum apart, hence the crystal packing has been proposed as a model for the association of contiguous EGF-like domains in proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since the adjacent EGF-like domain in the crystal, although close, is not covalently linked to its neighbour, this model requires verification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this study we have expressed and purified a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> binding EGF-like domain pair from human fibrillin-1 and used an in vitro refolding system to obtain protein with the correct EGF fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> binding properties of the protein have been investigated by two-dimensional NMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The affinity of the C-terminal domain for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> is approximately 25-fold higher than that of the N-terminal domain, consistent with the two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> binding sites having different local environments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, these data provide the first direct experimental evidence that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> plays a major role in defining the interdomain linkage in multiple repeats of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> binding EGF-like domains </plain></SENT>
