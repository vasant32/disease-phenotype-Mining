<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reported rates are probably underestimates of the true incidence of TAD because of difficulties in diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of TAD appears to have been increasing over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TAD is most common in men and older individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>Aortic dilatation</z:hpo> is a well-established risk factor for TAD but is not a prerequisite; most <z:hpo ids='HP_0004933'>ascending aortic dissections</z:hpo> occur when aortic diameter is &lt;5.5 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and smoking, are associated with TAD, evidence supporting their direct causal role is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Notably, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is remarkably uncommon in patients with TAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other risk factors for TAD include <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e>, iatrogenic aortic injury, and drug use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Congenital cardiovascular defects, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo>, and certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0567439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic syndromes</z:e>, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, are the genetic factors most commonly associated with TAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Specific nonsyndromic genetic mutations in families and single nucleotide polymorphisms have also been identified as possible risk factors for TAD </plain></SENT>
