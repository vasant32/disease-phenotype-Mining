<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Attempts at correlating genotype with phenotype have suggested considerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To define the subtype of fibrillinopathy caused by premature termination codon (PTC) mutations, we integrate genotype information and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels with clinical and biochemical phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By screening the entire FBN1 gene for mutations, we identified 34 probands with PTC mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the exception of two recurrent mutations, these nonsense and frameshift mutations are unique and span the entire FBN1 gene, from IVS2 to IVS63 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Allele-specific reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed differential allelic expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studied samples, with variable reduction of the mutant transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin protein synthesis and deposition into the extracellular matrix were studied by pulse-chase analysis of cultured fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the majority of PTC samples, synthesis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-sized fibrillin protein was approximately 50% of control levels, but matrix deposition was disproportionately decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Probands and mutation-positive relatives were clinically evaluated by means of a standardized protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 71% (22/31) of probands and 58% (14/24) of the mutation-positive family members met current clinical diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When compared with our previously reported study group of 44 individuals with FBN1 cysteine substitutions, the PTC group showed statistically significant differences in the frequency of individual signs, especially in the ocular manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Whereas large-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001382'>joint hypermobility</z:hpo> was more common, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>lens dislocation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> were distinctly less common in the PTC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that PTC mutations have a major impact on the pathogenesis of type 1 fibrillinopathies and convey a distinct biochemical, clinical, and prognostic profile </plain></SENT>
