<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is an increase of cardiac size and volume during pregnancy; furthermore hormonal changes lead to diaphragmatic elevation and barrel-shaped thorax followed by a rotation of the cardiac axis to the left (15 degrees-30 degrees) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardiac topography and size, changes in cardiac functioning and <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> as well as hemodynamic changes lead to auscultatory and ECG changes (i.e. S1-Q3-type, ST-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, T wave flattening) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This results in continuous cardiac stress during the whole pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This stress is specifically high from the 28th to the 34th week of pregnancy and in the post-partum period; the maximum of cardiac stress is reached during labor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Important for the specific cardiac risk during pregnancy is not the type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> but cardiac functioning and the severity of complaints before pregnancy </plain></SENT>
