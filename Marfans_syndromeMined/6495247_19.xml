<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The criteria for inclusion of details of a given patient in the study were the occurrence of Marfan abnormalities in at least two separate body systems (skeletal, cardiovascular, ocular) or in one body system where there was a family history of a classically affected first degree relative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Selection of cases was biased towards those with cardiorespiratory problems by virtue of the hospitals from which the patients were drawn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty eight patients underwent cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002108'>spontaneous pneumothorax</z:hpo>, which had been recurrent in 10 cases and bilateral in six </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight had had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> or excessively <z:hpo ids='HP_0002205'>frequent respiratory infections</z:hpo> and two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002110'>bronchiectasis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chest radiographs showed emphysematous bullae in five, upper lobe <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> in four, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0276651" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aspergilloma</z:e> in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cases reviewed together with other published evidence suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002108'>spontaneous pneumothorax</z:hpo> and bullae are causally related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of idiopathic upper lobe <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> in four Marfan patients is interesting but provides insufficient evidence to assess possible causality </plain></SENT>
