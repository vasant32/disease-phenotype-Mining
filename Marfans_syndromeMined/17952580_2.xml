<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a case series of four patients with Marfan or Marfan-like syndromes who underwent ablation for drug-refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ultimately three of four patients remained in sinus rhythm, however most patients required multiple ablative attempts and long-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> was common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, peri-procedural complications were minimal despite the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> and prosthetic valves in three of four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, catheter ablation of AF in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is a viable option in those individuals refractory to conventional therapy </plain></SENT>
