<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A positive family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> was found in 74.3% of the patients: the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> was dominant in 73.8% and recessive in 0.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>Sporadic</z:hpo> cases occurred in 25.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A screening of 29,067 children found five children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, giving a prevalence of 17.2 per 100,000 of the population, a gene frequency of 8.61 per 100,000 genes, and a penetrance of 71.69% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pleiotropy was clear in these cases: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo> in 77%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> in 86.8%, and <z:mp ids='MP_0011575'>dilated aortic root</z:mp> in 80.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chromosome examination showed no regular aberrations except in a family of five in whom a giant-satellited chromosome 14 was found in three afflicted members but not in the two unaffected relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The high prevalence of aortic root dilation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> makes echocardiography the most useful and practical means of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Close follow-up and regular echocardiographic evaluation are indicated not only in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> but also in their families, for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes </plain></SENT>
