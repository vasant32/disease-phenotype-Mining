<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the FBN1 gene cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) and a wide range of overlapping phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The severe end of the spectrum is represented by neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, the vast majority of probands carrying a mutation within exons 24-32 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that a mutation in exons 24-32 is predictive of a severe cardiovascular phenotype even in non-neonatal cases, and that mutations leading to premature truncation codons are under-represented in this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To describe patients carrying a mutation in this so-called 'neonatal' region, we studied the clinical and molecular characteristics of 198 probands with a mutation in exons 24-32 from a series of 1013 probands with a FBN1 mutation (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When comparing patients with mutations leading to a premature termination codon (PTC) within exons 24-32 to patients with an in-frame mutation within the same region, a significantly higher probability of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral insufficiency</z:hpo> were found in the second group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with a PTC within exons 24-32 rarely displayed a neonatal or severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also found a higher probability of neonatal presentations associated with exon 25 mutations, as well as a higher probability of cardiovascular manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A high phenotypic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> could be described for recurrent mutations, ranging from neonatal to classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, even if the exons 24-32 location appears as a major cause of the severity of the phenotype in patients with a mutation in this region, other factors such as the type of mutation or modifier genes might also be relevant </plain></SENT>
