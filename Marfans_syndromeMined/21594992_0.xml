<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report on a 20-year-old man who presented in infancy with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0009064'>generalized lipodystrophy</z:hpo> with a progeroid appearance and some Marfanoid features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He subsequently was diagnosed with bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001132'>lens subluxations</z:hpo> at the age of 16 years which prompted analysis of the FBN1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This analysis showed him to have a novel heterozygous, de novo, c.8156_8175del, p.Lys2719ThrfsX12, frameshift mutation in exon 64 of his FBN1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>His phenotype is similar to a patient described by Graul-Neumann et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>[2010] who was found to have a de novo, heterozygous, c.8155_8156del deletion in exon 64 of FBN1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both mutations result in a truncated protein with an extremely charged C-terminus, containing two positive and four negative charges in the last eight amino acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This most likely has a profound impact on proteinâ€“protein interactions, which are very important in the extracellular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The similarities in the phenotypes, and overlapping molecular defects, provides further evidence that the phenotype with features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0406586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neonatal progeroid syndrome</z:e>-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0009125'>lipodystrophy</z:hpo> is a distinct clinical entity due to frameshift mutations in exon 64 of the FBN1 gene </plain></SENT>
