<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we attempt to determine the early and long-term results, timing, and determinants of outcome of this operation in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Since 1979, 82 patients (73.2% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> undergoing resection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta) were operated on using this technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ages ranged from 2 to 69 years (mean, 33.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, there were 4 early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (4.9%), 2 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection and 2 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> operated on as emergencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in 67 patients operated on electively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival for patients operated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was 94.2%, 94.2%, and 94.2% at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively; that for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection was 72.7%, 63 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>6%, and 63.6%; and that for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection was 100%, 85.7%, and 75.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The probability of needing reoperation was 5.7%, 17.3%, and 17.3% at 1, 5, and 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no instances of infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> or thromboembolic complications except in 2 patients operated on early in the series who had cusp extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the end of the follow-up, trivial or no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> was demonstrated in 33.3%, mild in 45.6%, moderate in 21.1%, and severe in 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Valve-sparing operations are feasible in most patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>; they are applicable to patients with both dissection and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The early and long-term results are encouraging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Results are better in the absence of dissection, and prophylactic operation is warranted in some cases </plain></SENT>
