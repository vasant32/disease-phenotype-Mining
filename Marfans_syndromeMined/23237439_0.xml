<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its impact on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> (MVP) has not been completely studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined 35 patients undergoing reconstructive surgery due MVP complicated by severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral insufficiency</z:hpo> (mean age 62.5+/-7.9 years, 46% - men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High level of TGF-βl/2 was detected in majority (65%) of cases and correlated with the thickness of posterior leaflet (r=0.67; p=0.016), residual valve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> (r=0.68; p=0.007) and residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) (r=0.56; p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with high TGF-βl/2 level we detected a significant decrease in left ventricular longitudinal systolic (-13.5+/-2.2% vs. -16.6+/-2.3%, p=0.008) and diastolic (1.14+/-0.20 s-1 vs. 1.34+/-0.18 s-1, p=0.04) strain and SR (-0.89+/-0.15 s-1 vs. -1.14+/-0.15 s-1, p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, TGF-β has a significant impact on the progression of valve myxomatous degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The high activity of TGF-β signaling pathway results also in reduction in LV function, probably due to the profibrotic activity </plain></SENT>
