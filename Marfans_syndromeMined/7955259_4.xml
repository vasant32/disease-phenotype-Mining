<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic dissection</z:hpo> is one of the most lethal potential complications in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 360 patients undergoing operative treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> between 1963 and 1992, 40 had the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 24 men and 16 women with a mean age of 35 +/- 9 years (+/- 1 SD; range, 15 to 54 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients included 16 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A, 2 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type B, 18 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type A, and 4 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aortic arch was involved in 29 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preoperative complications included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> aortic valvular insufficiency in 13 patients, rupture into the pericardial space in 3, and loss of peripheral pulses in 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The site of primary intimal tear was the ascending aorta in 25 patients, the aortic arch in 2, the descending aorta in 7, and not identified in 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Operations included ascending aortic and aortic valvular replacement (with or without coronary artery reimplantation) in 22 patients, ascending aortic replacement alone in 5, and descending thoracic aortic replacement in 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (10 +/- 5% [+/- 70% confidence limits]) occurred in 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> patient-years and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type A patient-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up (216 patient-years; range, 1 month to 22 years; mean, 5.4 years) revealed 15 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, 7 from late aortic sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall actuarial survival estimates were 71 +/- 8%, 54 +/- 10%, and 22 +/- 11% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twenty late aortic operations were required in 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite satisfactory early results, the long-term survival of patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> was suboptimal (albeit similar to those without the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Future progress will pivot on reducing the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in these patients with medical therapy and/or earlier surgical intervention and enhanced postoperative serial imaging surveillance of the entire aorta </plain></SENT>
