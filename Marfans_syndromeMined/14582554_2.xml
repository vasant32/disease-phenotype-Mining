<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen subjects, mean age 23 years, performed spirometry, maximal ergometer cycle tests and knee extension and flexion isokinetic torque tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> had increased total and residual lung volume values compared with predicted values in healthy subjects and reduced peak oxygen uptake compared with healthy subjects of the same age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The isokinetic peak torque was reduced only at the highest velocity in the women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Thirteen subjects were able to perform the bicycle test until exhaustion without cardiovascular complications or pulmonary restrictions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, their aerobic capacity was considerably decreased, which we suggest is caused by deconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further investigations are needed to reveal how pulmonary and cardiovascular limitations change with ageing and to give guidelines for exercise </plain></SENT>
