<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> response to beta blockade in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> by non-invasive assessment of the aortic pressure-area curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND PATIENTS: 25 patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who used beta blocking agents (mean (SD) age, 29 (10) years; 20 men, five women), seven without beta blockade (34 (14) years; five men, two women), and 10 controls (29 (5) years; seven men, three women) underwent magnetic resonance imaging and non-invasive continuous blood pressure measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pressure-area curves were constructed at the level of the descending thoracic aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A transition point was defined as the pressure at which the pressure-area relation deviated from its elastic (linear) to the collagen (exponential) course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary referral centre for adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In six patients (five with and one without beta blockade), a transition point in the pressure-area curve was observed, indicating that the load bearing component was not only elastin but also collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 26 Marfan patients and in the control subjects a linear pressure-area relation was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This new non-invasive method to derive aortic pressure-area curves showed that most patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> have a similar pressure-area curve to controls with similar blood pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five patients on beta blockade showed a transition point in the pressure-area curve which could play a crucial role in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> response to beta blocker treatment in Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with a transition at <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>low blood pressures</z:hpo> may not benefit from beta blocking agents </plain></SENT>
