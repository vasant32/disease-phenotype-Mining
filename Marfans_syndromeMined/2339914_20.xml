<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The life expectancy of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> is significantly prolonged by graft replacement therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regardless, a significant predictor of late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is complications of either residual aortic aneurysmal disease or the development of additional <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper reviews a personal experience in the treatment of 4170 patients with aneurysmal disease of either dissection or medial degenerative origin, indicating that multiple segment involvement was or became present in 1262 (30%) patients, 463 (67%) of 694 patients with dissection, and 799 (23%) of 3476 patients without dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regardless of etiology, multiple involvement varied with the location of the presenting involved segment, i.e., ascending aorta (38%), ascending and arch (70%), descending thoracic aorta (73%), and abdominal aorta (26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study was limited in detail to 811 patients who had ascending and ascending and aortic arch replacement for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These patients were divided into 3 subgroups: (1) 524 patients with no distal disease; (2) 135 patients with distal disease treated by subtotal replacement in 82 and total replacement in 53; and (3) 152 patients with distal disease not treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival rate from the time of first operation, including early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from operation was 75% in group 1, 65% in group 2, and 39% in group 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in group 3 patients were aneurysmal rupture and/or associated disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that initial total aortic study and regular postoperative monitoring with computed tomographic scanning is indicated to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849867" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">extensive disease</z:e> or recurrence of disease and that aggressive replacement is indicated except in patients with associated disease that does not permit operation </plain></SENT>
