<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, administration of such medication from the midtrimester onward has been advocated in these patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present a case in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> administration of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> 150 mg/day to a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> with existing aortic root dilation was associated with repeated abnormal intrapartum fetal heart rate responses to vibroacoustic stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequent delivery of a nonhypoxic, nonacidotic infant suggests that maternal administration of beta-blockers should be considered in the interpretation of results of fetal vibroacoustic stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This case also supports that in similar clinical presentations, ultrasonographic confirmation of the fetal startle response, or alternatively observation of the resulting fetal recoil may be utilized rather than the fetal heart rate, which may be modulated by maternal medications </plain></SENT>
