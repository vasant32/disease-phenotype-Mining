<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Beta blockade slows <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> in adults, but there has been no definitive evidence in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the evolution of aortic diameter at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva in 155 children (82 males, 73 females) aged &lt;12 years who had been diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> according to international criteria was retrospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Affected children treated by beta blockade &gt;or=1 time during their lives (n = 77, mean age at diagnosis 6.1 +/- 3.2 years) were compared with affected children who had never received beta blockers (n = 78; 42 males, mean age 7.4 +/- 5.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A mean delay of 1.3 years was observed between diagnosis and the initiation of beta blockade in the treated group (mean age at initiation 7.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the time of diagnosis, aortic diameters were similar in the 2 groups, but after 1.3 years, aortic diameters were greater in the group of children in whom beta blockers had been initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, aortic diameter was related to age and height, but not gender or familial history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, treatment and age remained significant determinants of aortic diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Beta blockade significantly decreased the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva by a mean of 0.16 mm/year (p &lt;0.05), an effect that increased with treatment duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A trend toward lower cardiac mortality, decreased need for preventive aortic surgery, and less dissection was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, beta blockade appears to limit <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> during childhood in patients affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this treatment should be recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made </plain></SENT>
