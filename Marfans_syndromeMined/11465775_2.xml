<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine how well conventional radiographic findings can predict the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> in Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Twelve Marfan patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> and 21 Marfan patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five radiographic measurements were made of the lumbosacral spine: interpediculate distance, scalloping value, sagittal canal diameter, vertebral body width, and transverse process width </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The following measurements were significantly larger in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo>: interpediculate distances at L3-L4 levels (P&lt;0.03); scalloping values at the L1 and L5 levels (P&lt;0.05); sagittal diameters of the vertebral canal at L5-S1 (P&lt;0.03); transverse process to width ratios at L2 (P&lt;0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Criteria were developed for diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> in Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These included presence of one of the following: interpediculate distance at L4 &gt; or = 38.0 mm, sagittal diameter at S1 &gt; or = 18.0 mm, or scalloping value at L5 &gt; or = 5.5 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>Dural ectasia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is commonly associated with several osseous changes that are observable on conventional radiographs of the lumbosacral spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conventional radiography can detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> with a very high specificity (91.7%) but a low sensitivity (57.1%) </plain></SENT>
