<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Pediatric Heart Network is conducting a large international randomized trial to compare aortic root growth and other cardiovascular outcomes in 608 subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> randomized to receive atenolol or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> for 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors report here the echocardiographic methods and baseline echocardiographic characteristics of the randomized subjects, describe the interobserver agreement of aortic measurements, and identify factors influencing agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Individuals aged 6 months to 25 years who met the original Ghent criteria and had body surface area-adjusted maximum aortic root diameter (ROOTmax) Z scores &gt; 3 were eligible for inclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure for the trial is the change over time in ROOTmaxZ score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A detailed echocardiographic protocol was established and implemented across 22 centers, with an extensive training and quality review process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Interobserver agreement for the aortic measurements was excellent, with intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.921 to 0.989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lower interobserver percentage error in ROOTmax measurements was independently associated (model R(2) = 0.15) with better image quality (P = .002) and later study reading date (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic characteristics of the randomized subjects did not differ by treatment arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subjects with ROOTmaxZ scores ≥ 4.5 (36%) were more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> and dilation of the main pulmonary artery and left ventricle, but there were no differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, aortic stiffness indices, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo>, or left ventricular function compared with subjects with ROOTmaxZ scores &lt; 4.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The echocardiographic methodology, training, and quality review process resulted in a robust evaluation of aortic root dimensions, with excellent reproducibility </plain></SENT>
