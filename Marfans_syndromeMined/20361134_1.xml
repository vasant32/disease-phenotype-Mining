<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To report the experience with the Nuss procedure in adults' patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective study of patients operated between January 2007 and January 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical features, symptoms, operative time, postoperative complications, hospital stay and quality of life, using the Nuss questionnaire adapted for adults, was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen patients aged 18+/-2 years (14 males) were operated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> and one had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AU patients were concerned about aesthetic issues, nine had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo>, three had compression of cardiac cavities and three had pulmonary function disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Haller index was 3.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean operative time was 92 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative complications were a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo> without chest tube management in two patients, a peridural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> in one patient and a bar stabilizer <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> that required a reoperation in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patient died and the mean hospital stay was six days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The Nuss questionnaire scores in the pre and postoperative periods were 33 and 48, respectively (p &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nuss operation is feasible and safe in adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
