<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The calcium-binding epidermal growth factor (cbEGF)-like domain is a structural motif that is present in many matrix proteins throughout the animal kingdom from invertebrates to mammals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This module has been demonstrated to bind calcium in the micromolar range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the functional consequences of calcium binding to proteins that contain this structural element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used fibrillin-1, an extracellular matrix protein consisting of approximately 60% cbEGF-like motifs, as a model system to study stabilizing effects of calcium in protease degradation assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Authentic human fibrillin-1 and recombinant human fibrillin-1 subdomains, spanning the whole molecule, showed significantly slower proteolytic degradation in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3312">CaCl2</z:chebi> than in the presence of EDTA, demonstrating that calcium stabilizes the structure of fibrillin-1 and protects the molecule against proteolytic degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Information about cleavage sites protected by calcium was obtained with a new recombinant subdomain, rF17 (Asp 952-Val 1527), comprising the longest stretch of cbEGF-like motifs in the center of the fibrillin-1 molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most sensitive sites for trypsin and endoproteinase Glu-C were observed in cbEGF-like motifs 11 (Met 1034 and Asn 1046), 12 (Ser 1103), and 17 (Thr 1318) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since most of the currently known mutations in fibrillin-1 are found within cbEGF-like motifs and are predicted to disrupt calcium binding, we suggest that these mutations render fibrillin-1 more susceptible to proteolytic cleavage, and this might be one of the reasons why these mutations result in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
