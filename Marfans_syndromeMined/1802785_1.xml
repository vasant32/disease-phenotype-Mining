<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were distributed into three groups: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>lens dislocation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Marked arachnodacytyly was observed in the first group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these patients increase in finger length was positively correlated with the ridge count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moderate increase in finger length and ridge count was observed in the second group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relative finger length was lower in patients with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>lens dislocation</z:hpo> than in unaffected persons, though the ridge count did not differ from the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relations noted between the finger length and ridge count in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> are in agreement with the suggestion that these two parameters are determined by common cause, namely, the morphogenetic gradient in digital primordia </plain></SENT>
