<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Doctor Antoine Marfan described the first case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in 1896 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was over 50 years later that the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and subsequent rupture was appreciated as the most life-threatening component of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Doctor Vincent Gott, at our institution, performed the first Bentall procedure for an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta in 1976 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since that time, the aortic root has been replaced in 231 Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of this group, 218 patients had a composite graft repair, 11 had an aortic root replacement with a homograft, and 2 patients had valve sparing procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 168 males and 63 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the total 231 patients, 150 were operated on by Dr Gott </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining 81 patients were operated on by 10 other Hopkins surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average diameter of the ascending aorta was 6.8 cm, with a range from 4.5 to 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average aortic diameter of 43 patients who had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004933'>ascending aortic dissection</z:hpo> was 7.3 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of these patients had dissection with an aortic diameter of 6.5 cm or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 198 patients who underwent elective repair, there was no 30-day mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients underwent urgent repair with 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, yielding a 30-day mortality of 6.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mortality for the entire group of patients was 0.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Complications associated with this series of patients included 8 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, 7 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, and 4 late coronary dehiscences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival was 88% at 5 years, 81% at 10 years, and 75% at 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed New York Heart Association classification, male gender and urgent surgery as independent risk factors for mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Marfan patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> can undergo elective surgery with a low operative risk and excellent long-term survival with low morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>We feel that elective resection of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in a Marfan patient should occur when it approaches a diameter of 5.5 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>It is essential that a timely diagnosis be made in this group of young patients </plain></SENT>
