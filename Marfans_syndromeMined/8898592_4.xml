<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Clinical and laboratory data were collected from patients diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo> due to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17755">cystathionine</z:chebi> synthase deficiency, with special reference to the ages at which the patients had their first major signs of the disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> was established, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo> was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University hospital in the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: 34 patients (18 males) in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo> due to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17755">cystathionine</z:chebi> synthase deficiency was diagnosed in the period 1970-94 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 34 consecutively detected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo> patients the mean age at diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo> was 24 (range 1-61) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite frequent ocular manifestations, serious complications in the vascular, skeletal, and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> systems, and repeated examinations performed in these patients by clinicians of various disciplines, there was a mean delay of 11 (0-43) years between the first major signs of the disease (at mean age 13 (1-40) years) and the ultimate diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Even when <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> was diagnosed (in 26 (76%) patients, mean age 18 (1-50) years), this did not lead to adequate biochemical analysis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo> at the time of detection, causing a mean diagnostic delay of 8 (0-24) years in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Three factors should have precipitated the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo>: early recognition that unusual <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo> (high, very high, abnormal progressive, or at young age) was caused by subluxation of the ocular lenses; awareness that the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo> combined with systemic complications ("<z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo> plus") might be due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo>; and appropriate biochemical investigations carried out in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> and in their siblings </plain></SENT>
