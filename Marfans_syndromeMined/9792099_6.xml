<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data for the sixth TB module from human fibrillin-1 has revealed the existence of two stable conformers that differ in the isomerization states of two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32874">proline residues</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unusually, the two isoforms do not readily interconvert and are stable on the time scale of milliseconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have computed independent structures of the major and minor conformers of TB6 to assess how the domain fold adjusts to incorporate alternatively cis- or trans-prolines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on previous observations, it has been suggested that multiple conformers can only be accommodated in flexible regions of protein structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33479">P22</z:chebi>, which exists in trans in the major form and cis in the minor form of TB6, is in a rigid region of the domain, which is confirmed by backbone dynamics measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, the structures of the major and minor conformers are similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the secondary structure topologies of the two forms differ as a direct consequence of the changes in proline conformation </plain></SENT>
