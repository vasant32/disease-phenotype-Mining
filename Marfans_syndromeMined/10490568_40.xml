<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate survival and complication free survival in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and to assess the possible influence of recently revised guidelines for prophylactic aortic root replacement in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 130 patients who had been attending one institution over 14 years were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed in 125 patients who did not present with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340646" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic root dissection</z:e> as the first sign of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, with the end points: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340646" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic root dissection</z:e>, and prophylactic aortic root replacement after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the patients developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340646" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic root dissection</z:e>, current guidelines for prophylactic aortic root replacement were retrospectively applied to investigate the number of dissections that could theoretically have been prevented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The guidelines were: (1) aortic root diameter &gt;/= 55 mm, (2) positive family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> and aortic root diameter &gt;/= 50 mm, and (3) aortic root growth &gt;/= 2 mm/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcomes following emergency surgery (15 patients) and prophylactic surgery of the aortic root (30 patients) were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five and 10 year survival after diagnosis was 95% and 88%, and the five and 10 year complication free survival was 78% and 66%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients developed dissection, 30 underwent prophylactic repair, and 82 had an uncomplicated course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eleven dissections could theoretically have been prevented by application of the current guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five year survival following emergency and prophylactic repair of the aortic root was 51%, and 97%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Survival in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> in the past 14 years seems satisfactory; with application of current guidelines, it has probably even improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, because of the high fatality rate in Marfan patients developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340646" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic root dissection</z:e>, more extensive screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and a search for additional risk factors are desirable </plain></SENT>
