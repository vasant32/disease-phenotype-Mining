<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many of the more than 600 mutations currently known in fibrillin-1 eliminate or introduce <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32460">cysteine residues</z:chebi> in epidermal growth factor-like modules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report structural and functional consequences of three selected cysteine mutations (R627C, C750G, and C926R) in fibrillin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mutations have been analyzed by means of recombinant <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> produced in mammalian expression systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels for the mutation constructs were similar to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three mutated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> were secreted by embryonic kidney cells (293) into the culture medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Purification was readily feasible for mutants R627C and C750G, but not for C926R, which restricted the availability of this mutant <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> to selected analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall folds of the mutant <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> were indistinguishable from the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> as judged by the ultrastructural shape, CD analysis, and reactivity with a specific antibody sensitive for intact <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bonds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subtle structural changes caused by R627C and C750G, however, were monitored by proteolysis and heat denaturation experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These changes occurred in the vicinity of the mutations either as short range effects (R627C) or both short and long range effects (C750G) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Enhanced proteolytic susceptibility was observed for R627C and C750G to a variety of proteases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results expand and further strengthen the concept that proteolytic degradation of mutated fibrillin-1 might be an important potential mechanism in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and other disorders caused by mutations in fibrillin-1 </plain></SENT>
