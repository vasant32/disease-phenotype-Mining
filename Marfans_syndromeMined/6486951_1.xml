<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>Pectus excavatum</z:hpo> was repaired by the sternal eversion (turnover) technique in 26 patients over a 7-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vascular supply to the sternal graft was maintained by preservation of one internal mammary vascular pedicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Good results were obtained in 21 (81%) patients followed for periods ranging from 2 to 76 months (mean, 32 months) postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four patients (15%) had fair results; 2 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> had partial recurrence, as did 1 patient with skin <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and 1 with hypertrophic scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient (4%) had a poor early result due to wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and distal sternal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> requiring reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other complications were minor: superficial wound seroma in 2 patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo> in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sternal eversion technique for repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> utilizes the concave shape of the sternum when turned over to create a cosmetically acceptable convex anterior chest wall contour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Judicious tailoring of the costal cartilages and shaping of the anterior sternum corrects asymmetrical deformities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The chest wall is very stable after repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since no prosthetic struts or pins are used, a second operation for removal is avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Preservation of the vascular supply to the sternum should allow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> growth of the anterior chest wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results have been sufficiently encouraging for us to recommend sternal eversion as the primary method for repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
