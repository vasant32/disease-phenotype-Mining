<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate aortic diameter outcomes after stent-graft implantation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in the descending thoracic aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty patients with type A dissection after ascending aortic surgery (n = 10), type B dissection (n = 34), or intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> (n = 6) underwent stent-graft repair in 3 centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> and aortic diameter were analyzed by computed tomographic angiography at different levels of the aorta before stent-graft implantation, at discharge, and at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measurements were standardized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 67 stent-grafts were implanted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (n = 18) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (n = 32) dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stent-graft placement was successfully performed with high technical success (100%) despite 4 major complications (iliac <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in 2 cases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003496" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic rupture</z:e>, and a type A dissection) in 3 (6%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the thoracic false lumen was observed in 42% and 63% of cases at discharge and at follow-up (mean 15 months), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, the diameters of the entire aorta (mean 5 mm, p &lt; 0.05) and the false lumen (mean 11 mm, p &lt; 0.0001) decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diameters of the abdominal aorta remained stable in association with persistent false lumen perfusion at this level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aortic diameter results were better in the subgroup of patients with intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> compared to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> unrelated to the stent-graft procedure occurred; 2 patients with partial <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the false lumen died in follow-up secondary to aortic diameter growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Complete <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the false lumen by stent-graft coverage of the entry tear results in decreased diameter of the entire aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In patients with partial <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the false lumen, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> continues to enlarge </plain></SENT>
