<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mathematical modeling of various aortic valve or root replacements requires tissue material properties, and those of the aortic sinuses are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to compare the biaxial mechanical properties of the individual porcine aortic sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Square specimens, oriented in the longitudinal and circumferential directions, were excised from the left coronary, right coronary, and noncoronary porcine sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue thickness was measured, and specimens were subjected to equibiaxial mechanical testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stress-strain data corresponding to a 35% stretch were fitted to a Fung strain energy function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tissue stiffness and anisotropy were compared at 0.3 strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The circumferential direction was more compliant than the longitudinal one for left coronary (183.03 +/- 40.78 kPa versus 231.17 +/- 45.38 kPa, respectively; p = 0.04) and right coronary sinuses (321.74 +/- 129.68 kPa versus 443.49 +/- 143.59 kPa, respectively; p = 0.02) at 30% strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No such differences were noted for noncoronary sinuses (331.74 +/- 129.68 kPa versus 415.98 +/- 191.38 kPa; p = 0.19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Left coronary sinus was also significantly more compliant than right and noncoronary sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between right coronary and noncoronary sinus tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the material properties of the porcine aortic sinuses are not symmetric </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The left coronary sinus is significantly more compliant than the remaining sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Realistic modeling of the aortic root must take into account the asymmetric differences in tissue material properties of the aortic sinuses </plain></SENT>
