<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, even aggressive conventional therapy may ultimately fail in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Administration of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) may be the only remaining therapeutic option to stop life-threatening coagulopathic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We here describe the clinical course of 5 patients exhibiting severe continuous <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> that could not be stopped by surgical intervention and appropriate hemostatic management but resolved after a mean dose of 90 microg/kg of rFVIIa (range, 90-120 microg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four of the five patients recovered completely, and one patient died after developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> in multiorgan failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> from wound surfaces stopped within minutes of the administration of rFVIIa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Coagulation measurements improved, and transfusion requirements declined considerably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No adverse effects associated with rFVIIa were observed </plain></SENT>
