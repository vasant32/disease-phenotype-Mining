<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their importance in bone biology is illustrated by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>skeletal abnormalities</z:hpo> manifest in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital disorder</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, which results from mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the expression of fibrillins and other microfibril-associated proteins in human bone and bone-derived osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> extracted from cancellous bone showed expression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> encoding fibrillin-1 and -2, MAGP-1 and -2, LTBP-2, and MP78/70 (Big-h3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In demineralized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mature bone, fibrillin-1 was immunolocalized to fibrils within the bone matrix and pericellularly to cells lining the endosteal surfaces of trabecular bone, some osteocytes, and cells associated with blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LTBP-2 was also identified at the endosteal surface and within the bone matrix in a lamellar fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, primary osteoblast-like cells cultured from human trabecular bone (obtained from patients at joint replacement surgery) were found to express abundant <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for fibrillins and associated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, using western blot analysis, fibrillin-1 protein was shown to be secreted into the medium and to be deposited into the cell layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence staining of the cell layer visualized fibrillin-1 in the matrix as a three-dimensional network of fine filaments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Expression of fibrillin-1 by osteoblast-like cells was constitutive, and a number of skeletally active agents had little effect on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> or protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results show that human osteoblasts from mature bone express fibrillins and other microfibril-associated proteins, and suggest a role for these molecules in adult human bone </plain></SENT>
