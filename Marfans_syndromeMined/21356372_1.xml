<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the factors increasing susceptibility to coronary artery lesions are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because transforming growth factor (TGF) β increases elastin synthesis and suppresses proteolysis, we hypothesized that, in contrast to the benefit observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> forming in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, inhibition of TGF-β would worsen inflammatory-induced coronary artery lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By using a murine model of KD in which injection of Lactobacillus casei wall extract (LCWE) induces coronary <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo>, we show that LCWE increased TGF-β signaling in the coronary smooth muscle cells beginning at 2 days and continuing through 14 days, the point of peak coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By 42 days, LCWE caused fragmentation of the internal and external elastic lamina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blocking TGF-β by administration of a neutralizing antibody accentuated the LCWE-mediated fragmentation of elastin and induced an overall loss of medial elastin without increasing the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We attributed these increased pathological characteristics to a reduction in the proteolytic inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and an associated threefold increase in matrix metalloproteinase 9 activity compared with LCWE alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our data demonstrate that in the coronary <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> associated with KD, TGF-β suppresses elastin degradation by inhibiting plasmin-mediated matrix metalloproteinase 9 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, strategies to block TGF-β, used in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, are unlikely to be beneficial and could be detrimental </plain></SENT>
