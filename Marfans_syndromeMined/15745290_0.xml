<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In many cases, however, mechanical prosthetic conduits are not suitable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are few reports in the English-language medical literature concerning the mid- to long-term outcome of Bentall operations with cryopreserved homografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we reviewed our experience with this procedure and valved homografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From January 1997 through December 2002, 21 patients underwent a Bentall operation with cryopreserved homografts at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 14 males and 7 females; the mean age was 36 +/- 21 years (range, 15-74 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients had undergone previous aortic valve surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> involving the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Indications for surgery included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic valve stenosis</z:hpo> or insufficiency, and aortic valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (native valve or prosthetic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu</z:e>'s <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> and 3 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was 1 hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>), but no other major postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean hospital stay was 14 +/- 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Follow-up echocardiographic and computed tomographic scans were performed yearly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 34 months (6-72 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Follow-up imaging revealed no calcifications or degenerative processes related to the homograft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Four patients had minimal valve regurgitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Two patients died during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The 3-year actuarial survival rate was 85.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the Bentall procedure with a valved homograft conduit is a safe procedure with excellent mid- to long-term results, comparable to results reported with aortic valve replacement with a homograft </plain></SENT>
