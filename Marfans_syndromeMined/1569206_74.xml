<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To examine the associations among fibrillin gene mutations, protein function, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> phenotype, we screened for alterations in the fibrillin coding sequence in patients with a range of manifestations and clinical severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A cysteine to serine substitution at codon 1409 (C1409S) was identified in an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like motif from one fibrillin allele which segregates with the disease phenotype through three generations of a family affected with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This alteration was not observed in 60 probands from other families or in 88 unrelated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The altered cysteine is completely conserved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EGF-like motifs identified in fibrillin, and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> proteins that contain this motif </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These observations strongly indicate that C1409S is the disease-producing mutation in this family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The phenotype of individuals carrying C1409S varied widely with respect to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of disease, organ-system involvement, and clinical severity; certain affected adults were unaware of their status before being diagnosed through this investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that fibrillin gene defects cause familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, that mutations in the EGF-like motif of the fibrillin gene are not uniformly associated with severe disease, and that fibrillin genotype is not the sole determinant of Marfan phenotype </plain></SENT>
