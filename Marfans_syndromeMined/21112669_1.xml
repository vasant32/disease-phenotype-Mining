<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to clarify the value of skin signs in patients with MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 61 consecutive patients (median age: 34 years) seen in the French Reference Centre for MS and Related Disorders and with a confirmed diagnosis of MS were paired with 61 age-, sex-, and height-paired control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had a structured interview and standardized dermatologic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The gold standard for MS diagnosis was the Ghent criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001065'>Striae</z:hpo> of any type were significantly (P = .0001) more frequent in patients with MS (92%) than in control subjects (61%), but specificity was low (39%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 27-52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001065'>Striae</z:hpo> on unusual locations (other than buttock, hip, or thigh) were more frequent in patients with MS (66%) than in control subjects (16%) (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This finding had a high specificity (84%, 95% CI 74-93), without notably decreasing sensitivity (66%, 95% CI 54-77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hypertrophic, large, or atrophic surgical or posttraumatic, frequently hypopigmented or hyperpigmented, scars were present in 46% of patients with MS and 21% of control subjects (P = .007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity was 46% (95% CI 34-58) and specificity 79% (95% CI 67-87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001065'>striae</z:hpo> in some control subjects could be attributed to intensive practice of sports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATION: A few control subjects were selected from patients consulting the MS center but without a diagnosis of MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001065'>Striae</z:hpo> are a good diagnostic criterion for MS, particularly when arising in unusual sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Other reported skin signs of MS are infrequent </plain></SENT>
