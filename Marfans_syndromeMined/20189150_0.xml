<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are environmental microbes that are associated with a variety of human diseases, particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0002783'>chronic lung infections</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over the past several decades, NTM <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lung disease</z:e> has been increasingly seen in postmenopausal women with slender body habitus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This article reviewed the clinical and experimental evidence that supports the observation that thin older women (aged 50-80 years) are predisposed to NTM <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lung disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We posited 3 potential pathways for this predisposition: relative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> deficiency, abnormal levels of adipokines that alter immune responses, and abnormal expression of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) related to fibrillin anomalies similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using the PubMed database, a literature search was performed (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> publications up to July 2009) by pairing the key phrase nontuberculous mycobacteria with weight, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo>, female gender, body habitus, leptin, adipokines, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>, menopause, postmenopausal, or body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Non-English-language articles were included if their abstracts were in English </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relevant articles were also identified from the abstracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Published case reports and series indicate that in the past 20 years, NTM <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lung disease</z:e> has been recognized in disproportionately increased numbers in postmenopausal women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among these patients, slender body habitus and thoracic cage abnormalities, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, are commonly described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Notably, no long-term prospective clinical studies exist to corroborate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0004325'>low weight</z:hpo> is an independent risk factor for NTM <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lung disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, based on the findings of a limited number of experimental studies, we hypothesize that decreased leptin, increased adiponectin, and/or decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> in older women with slender body habitus may account for their increased susceptibility to NTM <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We further speculate that in some patients with features mindful of MPS (slender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>), there may be anomalies of fibrillin, similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, that lead to the expression of the immunosuppressive cytokine TGP-beta further increasing their susceptibility to NTM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is likely that both sufficient environmental exposure and host susceptibility are required for the establishment of NTM <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lung disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The observation that NTM <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0876973" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lung infections</z:e> are more common in slender, older women without any overt immune defects suggests that abnormal expression of adipokines, sex hormones, and/or TGF-beta may play an important role in their susceptibility </plain></SENT>
