<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to precise its genetic background, we performed a segregation analysis on 32 French families (320 subjects including 120 individuals with clinical data) containing at least one high myopic person in their genealogy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under the assumption of a two-alleles single gene model, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> transmission mode showed a much greater likelihood than the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> mode, which therefore was rejected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From the segregation model obtained, a two-point linkage analysis was made on 18 families (107 subjects), among the 32 used for the segregation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Different candidate loci were tested: collagen genes including Stickler syndrome types 1 and 2, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> genes, Marfan 1 syndrome and a Marfan like disorder localised in 3p24.2-p25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No evidence of linkage was found with any of the studied markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the absence of linkage with chromosome 18p11.31 markers, a locus linked to familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011003'>high myopia</z:hpo> in 6 North American families and 1 family of Chinese descent, demonstrated the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the disease </plain></SENT>
