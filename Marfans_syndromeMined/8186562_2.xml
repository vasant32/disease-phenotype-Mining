<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred seventy-four Marfan patients have had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> repair with a prosthetic composite graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An additional four children and two adults have had aortic root replacement with a cryopreserved homograft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven (21%) patients came to operation with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection involving the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one (17%) patients having aortic root replacement also had mitral valve repair or replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first 86 patients in the series had a hemostatic Bentall wrap constructed; however, in the last 88 patients, the ascending aorta has been transected completely and the aortic wall tacked loosely over the composite graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is our preference to construct a direct end-to-side anastomosis of each coronary ostium to the side of the composite graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the past, we used the Cabrol interposed graft for low-lying coronary ostia, but currently favor the "button technique" for this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One hundred fifty-six of 180 patients underwent elective root replacement with no hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients underwent urgent or emergency surgery; 17 of these patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection or rupture underwent emergency surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two of these patients with rupture died intraoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, overall hospital mortality among the 180 patients was 1.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There have been 14 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> among 178 patients discharged from the hospital (7.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Five of these late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred among our first 11 patients operated on between 1976 and 1979 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Since 1980, there have been nine late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> among 167 patients (5.4%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
