<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed our experience with 65 patients (adults and children) who had this operation at our institution to determine early and late outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective clinical review was undertaken using hospital records, clinical and echocardiographic, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging data, and telephone interviews with patients and their physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between July 1994 and December 2002, 65 patients (46 adults and 19 children) underwent a valve-sparing operation for aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-four of the patients had the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>; the remaining 21 had either a nonspecific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> (14 patients) or a miscellaneous disease process such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e> (7 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight (89%) had a David II (remodeling) procedure and 7 had a David I (reimplantation) procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The DePaulis "Valsalva graft" was used in six of the David I patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no operative or hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>; only one late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in an adult due to salmonella <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, survival was 100% at one year and 98% at 3 and 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (7 adults and 3 children) developed significant late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> (AI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nine of these patients had a David II procedure and in 8 of these cases, AI was secondary to significant late annular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One of the 10 patients developed late AI 8.2 years after a David I procedure; his AI was secondary to aortic leaflet extension and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Six of the 10 patients who developed significant late AI required aortic valve replacement (4 adults and 2 children) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Freedom from late aortic valve replacement (AVR) in this series of 65 patients was 91% at 3 and 84% at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At the close of this study, 58 patients were New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I and 6 were NYHA class II; no patients were class III or IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There were no episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> or clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Valve-sparing operations provide satisfactory results for many patients with an aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, but the David II remodeling procedure has a greater risk of late annular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and AI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The David I reimplantation procedure utilizing the DePaulis Valsalva graft may obviate this problem </plain></SENT>
