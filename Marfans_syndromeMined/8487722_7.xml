<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationship between age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and to define the rate of progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were evaluated in a multidisciplinary clinic to establish a firm diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aortic dimensions were measured by echocardiography and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> were followed up with annual physical and echocardiographic examinations to detect any change in aortic diameter over the subsequent four years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: One hundred and fifty-seven patients were referred to the clinic for assessment, of whom 40 exhibited diagnostic features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only 24 of these patients had previously been diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, while 17 other patients, previously diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, had insufficient clinical features to justify the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 40 patients (19 male, 21 female) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (mean age, 28 +/- 15 years), the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001626'>cardiovascular abnormalities</z:hpo> was 90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>Aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> was present in 78% of patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> in 28%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> in 65% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> in 35% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean aortic root diameter in the Marfan patients (21.4 +/- 4.0 mm/m2 body surface area) markedly exceeded that of age and sex matched controls without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (14.9 +/- 2.2 mm/m2) and that of first-degree relatives without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (15.3 +/- 2.9 mm/m2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> was variable, with patients as young as 20 years exhibiting severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> exhibiting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> were advised to take beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, unless contraindicated, in an effort to retard the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among 33 patients followed up for at least one year, 14 (42%) exhibited an increase in aortic diameter of at least 2 mm, while 16 of 23 patients (70%) followed up for at least three years exhibited similar progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall mean rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> in the Marfan patients was 1.9 mm per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nine patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> of more than 50 mm diameter during four years' follow-up and required surgical repair of the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Each of these patients is well at between three months' and four years' follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aneurysmal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the aorta is a common complication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and may become manifest at an early age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> can progress rapidly, even in the absence of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> should have annual echocardiographic examinations to monitor aortic root dimensions, and those exhibiting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> or an aortic root diameter in excess of 50 mm, should be considered for elective composite graft repair of the aorta </plain></SENT>
