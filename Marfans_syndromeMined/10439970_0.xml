<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe two unrelated cases of FAP with unusual extracolonic phenotypes, namely several abnormalities of mesodermal origin strongly resembling <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) or a Marfan-like habitus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conventional cytogenetic and FISH analysis did not reveal any gross chromosomal rearrangement on the long arm of chromosome 5 where the APC and FBN2 genes were located </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in case 2 the FAP-causing mutation in the APC gene was found in the donor splice site of exon 4 and was shown to result in a frameshift and a premature termination codon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We propose that such connective tissue abnormalities may result from germline APC mutations in combination with specific genetic and/or environmental modifying factors </plain></SENT>
