<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> was present in 45% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the earlier period from 1972 to 1976, the operative and hospital mortality rates were 40%, and it was reduced to 0% (p less than 0.08) in the later period from 1977 to 1981 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Operative survivors showed the mean clinical improvement from the NYHA class 3.0 to 1.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The LVEDP and the left ventricular dimension were significantly reduced toward <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival rate at 6 years after operation was 71% in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Bentall operation can now be performed with a low risk, and can improve the clinical and hemodynamic states significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type I <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, a false lumen remained patent after surgery regardless of the types of graft-distal aorta anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The fate of the remaining dissection is undetermined, but some may require further surgery </plain></SENT>
