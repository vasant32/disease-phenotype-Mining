<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate biomechanical aortic properties in Marfan patients and in their relatives to identify an early index of aortic involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) morphologic and functional study of the thoracic aorta was performed in 20 Marfan patients, 15 family members, and 14 healthy volunteers as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aorta was imaged in the oblique sagittal plane by spin-echo sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A high-resolution gradient-echo sequence was then applied in the axial plane at the level of ascending supravalvular aorta to evaluate aortic distensibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aortic distensibility (mm Hg(-1) was significantly different in the three groups (ANOVA, p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aortic distensibility was sensibly reduced in Marfan patients (0.0085 +/- 0.006 vs. 0.025 +/- 0.006 control group, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was found between aortic area and distensibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aortic distensibility was reduced also in family members (0.016 +/- 0.011 vs. 0.025 +/- 0.006 control group, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among them, 4 subjects showed aortic diameters to the upper limit of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, whereas the other 11 presented <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aortic diameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility for diastolic measurement was 1.2% and 0.4%, respectively, and 1.1% and 0.3%, respectively, for systolic measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MRI is an accurate technique in detecting abnormal aortic elastic properties in Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Abnormal ascending aorta distensibility may constitute an index of early aortic involvement before dilation occurs </plain></SENT>
