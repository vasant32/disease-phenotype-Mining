<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report describes our initial experience with graft replacement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> using a superior mini-sternotomy approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between March 1997 and October 1997, four patients underwent operation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> via superior mini-sternotomy approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were two female and two male patients, ranging in age from 52 to 62 years (mean 53.7 +/- 7.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had the stigmata of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean diameter of the ascending aortas was 6.1 +/- 0.9 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Composite graft replacement with coronary reimplantation was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one patient hemiarch replacement was performed under total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no hospital (30-day) mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean aortic cross clamp and cardiopulmonary bypass times were 63 +/- 14.1 minutes (range 44 to 78) and 116.7 +/- 43.3 minutes (range 81 to 177), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient was re-explored for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lengths of hospital stay ranged from 5 to 7 days (mean 5.5 +/- 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed-up for at least 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One patient suffered a fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in her third postoperative month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> surviving patients were in NYHA Class I at the sixth postoperative month and thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive graft replacement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> can be performed safely and effectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Long term results are likely to be similar to those of conventional cases performed through a full median sternotomy </plain></SENT>
