<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two hundred fifty-two patients underwent a Bentall composite graft repair and 18 patients received a cryopreserved homograft aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred eighty-seven patients had a Marfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta (41 with dissection) and 53 patients had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> resulting from nonspecific medial degeneration (17 with dissection) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These 240 patients were considered to have annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients were operated on for miscellaneous lesions of the aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-day mortality for the overall series of 270 patients was 4.8% (13/270) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no 30-day mortality among 182 patients undergoing elective root replacement for annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> without dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six of the 270 patients having root replacement also had mitral valve operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no hospital mortality for aortic root replacement in these 36 patients, but there were seven late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients received a cryopreserved homograft aortic root; 18 of these were primary root replacements and four were repeat root replacements for late <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and two late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival for the overall group of 270 patients was 73% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, only poor New Year Heart Association class (III and IV), non-Marfan status, preoperative dissection, and male gender emerged as significant predictors of early or late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>Endocarditis</z:hpo> was the most common late complication (14 of 256 hospital survivors) and was optimally treated by root replacement with a cryopreserved aortic homograft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Late problems with the part of the aorta not operated on occur with moderate frequency; careful follow-up of the distal aorta is critical to long-term survival </plain></SENT>
