<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the operative technique and preliminary results of video-assisted thoracoscopic anterior correction and fusion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven cases underwent thoracoscopic anterior correction and fusion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> from March 2003 to April 2005 in our hospital were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> females with an average age of 13.1 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of which, 9 cases were idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, 1 case was congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, and 1 case was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The coronal Cobb angle and apical vertebral translation before and after surgery as well as at final follow-up were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The operation time, blood loss during operation, and peri-operative complications were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results The mean operation time was 6.4 hours, mean instrumented vertebrae were 6.4 segments, and mean blood loss during operation was 364 mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The coronal Cobb angles of the thoracic curve before and after surgery were 45.5 degrees and 15.4 degrees respectively, with an average correction rate of 65.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The lumbar curve was corrected from 28.4 degrees lation to 11.8 degrees, with an average simultaneous correction rate of 57.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients were followed up regularly with an average time of 21.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the final follow-up, the coronal Cobb angles of the thoracic and lumbar curves were 19.0 degrees and 20.1 degrees, with a 3.6 degrees and 8.3 degrees loss of correction, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The apical vertebral translation was improved from 32.3 mm to 10.5 mm for the thoracic curve, and from 13.1 mm to 8.2 mm for the lumbar curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were 6 cases with peri-operative complications, including 1 case of thoracic effusion, 1 case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010310'>chylothorax</z:hpo>, 1 case of locking plug loosing, 2 cases of aggravation of the unfused lumbar curve (1 case also with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005619'>thoracolumbar kyphosis</z:hpo>), and 1 case with a screw tip causing a contour deformity of the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>And 4 of them underwent revision surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Video-assisted thoracoscopic anterior correction and fusion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> has good correction capability, less intraoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, and favorable cosmetic effect for mild and moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002943'>thoracic scoliosis</z:hpo>, but with higher rates of correction loss of the lumbar curve and peri-operative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A surgeon should be cautious to perform this technique. ders </plain></SENT>
