<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate presenting signs and clinical diagnosis in a cohort of patients referred to rule out <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on patients referred to the Cleveland Clinic Foundation between November 1993 and July 2001 to rule out <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical findings necessary for the diagnosis of the disorder according to current criteria (De Paepe et al., Am J Med Genet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>1996;62:417-426) were determined through complete physical examination and testing, including an echocardiogram and a slit-lamp examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Information regarding age, sex, reason for evaluation, family history, symptoms, and ultimate clinical diagnosis were extracted from the charts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-five patients averaging 23.5 years of age completed a comprehensive evaluation to rule out <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A clinical diagnosis of this condition was made in 28 (37%) patients (12 males, 16 females) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reasons for referral included one or more of the following: (1) the finding by a physician of one or more typical clinical manifestations of the disease; (2) a known family history of the syndrome; and/or (3) curiosity on the part of the patient or family as a result of publicity about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in lay or medical journals or in television programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight individuals (37% of the total group) were referred because of skeletal findings common to the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these, 10 (36%) were diagnosed with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seven (78%) of the nine patients who presented with ocular signs or symptoms were ultimately diagnosed with the disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the 22 individuals referred because of cardiovascular signs or symptoms, nine (41%) were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twelve (31%) of 39 individuals with a known family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> or symptoms common to this condition had a positive diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of six individuals evaluated in response to publicity about the disease, two (33%) were ultimately diagnosed with the disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The most common reasons for evaluation to rule out <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> include a positive family history of the condition and the presence of one of its common manifestations (e.g., body habitus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo>, or subluxated lenses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the present series of patients, the physical finding that predicted the diagnosis most was subluxation of the ocular lens </plain></SENT>
