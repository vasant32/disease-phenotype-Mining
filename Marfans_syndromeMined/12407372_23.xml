<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 36-year clinical experience of medical and surgical treatments in 189 patients was retrospectively analyzed (multivariable Cox proportional hazards model) with respect to three outcome end points: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, freedom from reoperation, and freedom from late aortic complications or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Propensity score analysis identified 2 quintiles (quintiles I and II, consisting of 142 comparable patients) for further comparison of the effects of surgical versus medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Shock (hazard ratio 14.5, 95% confidence interval 4.7-44.5, P &lt;.001) and visceral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (hazard ratio 10.9, 95% confidence interval 3.9-30.3, P &lt;.001) largely predominated as determinants of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, along with 6 other risk factors (arch involvement, rupture, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, previous sternotomy, and coronary or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lung disease</z:e>), which roughly doubled the hazard of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Female sex was a significant but weaker predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>Renal dysfunction</z:hpo>, year of presentation, age, and mode of therapy (medical vs surgical) had no important bearing on overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival estimates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were 71%, 60%, 35%, and 17% at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively, and were similar for the medical and surgical patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reoperation and late aortic complications were predicted by the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the propensity-matched patients in quintiles I and II, survival, freedom from reoperation, and freedom from aortic complications were almost identical in the medically treated and surgical subsets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> is bleak and determined primarily by dissection-related and patient-specific risk factors, which do not appear to be readily modifiable </plain></SENT>
