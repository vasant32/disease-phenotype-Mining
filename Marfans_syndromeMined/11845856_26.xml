<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The introduction of composite graft repair of aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> by Hugh Bentall in 1968 promised Marfan patients the choice for a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> life expectancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed our first Bentall composite graft procedure in 1976 and herein report our 24-year experience with 271 Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between September 1976 and August 2000, 232 Marfan patients had a composite graft replacement of the aortic root, 15 patients received a homograft, and 24 had a valve-sparing procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-five Marfan patients underwent elective aortic root replacement with no 30-day mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred among 36 patients who underwent urgent or emergent operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighty-three percent of patients in this series are currently alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The actuarial freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, and reoperation on the residual aorta 20 years postoperatively was 93%, 90%, and 74% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients have undergone valve-sparing procedures with encouraging results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elective aortic root replacement for Marfan patients can be performed with low operative risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Elective repair before the aortic root reaches 6 cm in diameter is recommended to minimize risk of dissection and rupture </plain></SENT>
