<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fate of false lumen on the stent graft border was expressed by CT scan follow-up that were patent in 0, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in 5 and absorption in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient who had new <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> 8 years after initial surgery required the Crawford V operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten-years-survival rate was 100% and ten years-event free rate was 67%.Conclusions: Frozen elephant trunk technique was feasible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and might become alternative prophylactic treatment to the downstream aorta for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
