<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated changes in basal and receptor-stimulated endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activity after isolation of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and Marfan mouse aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Starting 1h after dissection, basal NO release was assessed at hourly intervals by its ability to suppress isometric contractions in aortic segments </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> or UK14304 relaxation curves changed minimally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>l-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e> and eNOS-deficiency abolished basal NO production, unlike inhibitors of neuronal (N(Ω)-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="26308">propyl</z:chebi>-l-arginine) or inducible (1400W) NOS </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunoblotting showed unchanged eNOS expression, or phosphorylation at Ser1177, Ser617 or Thr495 between 1h and 4h, but Akt phosphorylation declined gradually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The dramatic loss of basal NO release after tissue isolation shows that timing is crucial when studying NO responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The preservation of receptor-induced relaxation implies differential regulation of basal and stimulated eNOS activity, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi>-3-kinase/Akt signalling seems specifically associated with basal eNOS activity </plain></SENT>
