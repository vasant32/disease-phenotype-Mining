<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examines the long-term results of these operations in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1988 to 2006, 103 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (mean age, 37 +/- 12 years) and aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> had aortic valve-sparing operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Emergency surgery was performed in 11 patients: 8 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and 3 for unexplained persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients also had mitral valve surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The technique of aortic valve reimplantation was used in 77 patients, and aortic root remodeling was used in 26 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed prospectively and underwent annual echocardiographic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 7.3 +/- 4.2 years and 100% complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was 1 operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and 5 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four of the 6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were due to complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patients' survival at 15 years was 87.2% compared with 95.6% for the general population of Ontario matched for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had important <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo>: 4 mild to moderate, 2 moderate, and 1 moderate to severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Freedom from greater than mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> at 15 years was 79.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Three patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> after aortic root remodeling, had aortic valve replacement, 2 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> and 1 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At the most recent follow-up, 97 patients were alive: 86 were in functional class I, and 11 were in functional class II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aortic valve-sparing operations provided excellent clinical outcomes in this series of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> were the leading cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
