<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently it is considered that the prognosis and morphologic characteristics in infantile <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> may be quite different from those reported in older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to analyze the cardiovascular manifestations and evolution of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> followed at our pediatric cardiac unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors reviewed the clinical files of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients that fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for MS according to De Paepe et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(1996) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the following parameters: gender, age at referral, race, family history, clinical examination, diagnostic exams, therapy and evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into two groups according to the age at diagnosis: infants (group 1) and older patients (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Group 1 included 3 infants, two boys and one girl, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases, presenting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The major cardiac diagnoses were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> (1/3) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (2/3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>Congenital heart disease</z:hpo> was associated in two cases (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001643'>patent ductus arteriosus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two needed cardiac surgery at an early age and one was recently proposed for surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Group 2 included 20 patients, 14 boys and 6 girls, first seen at a mean age of 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ten had a positive family history and none presented cardiac symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The major cardiac manifestations were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> (18/20) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> (17/20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was no significant progression of the cardiac lesions, except for one case, during the 12 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Infantile MS presented high morbidity; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> was severe in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presented <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, two needing early operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In classic MS evolution was favorable, and the commonest cardiac lesions were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>We emphasize the need for beta-blockers to prevent progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The decision for surgery rests upon the severity of valve regurgitation and the rate of progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>It is important to inform patients and family about physical exercise, prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, risks associated with pregnancy and genetic counseling </plain></SENT>
