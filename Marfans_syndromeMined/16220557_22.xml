<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical spectrum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> is highly variable and includes involvement of the cardiovascular, skeletal, ocular, and other organ systems; however, the genotype-phenotype correlations have not been well developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Various screening methods have led to the identification of about 600 different mutations (FBN1-UMD database; www.umd.be) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we performed SSCP and/or direct sequencing to analyze <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 65 exons of the FBN1 gene in 116 patients presenting with classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> or related phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine novel and nine recurrent mutations were identified in 38 of the analyzed patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mutations comprised 18 missense (47%), eight nonsense (21%), and five splice site (13%) mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven further mutations (18%) resulted from deletion, insertion, or duplication events, six of which led to a frameshift and subsequent premature termination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we describe new polymorphisms and sequence variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the data presented here and in a previous study, we were able to establish highly significant correlations between the FBN1 mutation type and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> phenotype in a group of 76 mutation-positive patients for whom comprehensive clinical data were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most strikingly, there was a significantly lower incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> in patients who carried a mutation that led to a premature termination codon (PTC) or a missense mutation without cysteine involvement in FBN1, as compared to patients whose mutations involved a cysteine substitution or splice site alteration </plain></SENT>
