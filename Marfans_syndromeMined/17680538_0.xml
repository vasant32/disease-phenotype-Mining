<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To detect novel mutations in the fibrillin 1 (FBN1) and transforming growth factor beta receptor type II (TGFBR2) genes by screening the genes from 14 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) was introduced to screen for FBN1 and TGFBR2 mutations exon-by-exon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The DNA amplification fragments which DHPLC elution profiles showed different from the corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elution profile were sequenced to identify the positions and types of mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was employed to further prove the mutations when needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two gene mutations of the FBN1 were found in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were a novel substitutional mutation (Intron29 +4A &gt; T) of FBN1 and a recurrent nonsense mutation (8080C &gt;T) of FBN1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intron29 +4A &gt; T and 8080C &gt; T of FBN1 are possibly the pathogenesis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
