<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) is an underrecognized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heritable connective tissue disorder</z:e> resulting from mutations in the gene for fibrillin-1 (FBN1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Affected patients are at risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and/or severe ocular and orthopedic problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis is primarily based on a set of well-defined clinical criteria (Ghent nosology) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The age-related nature of some clinical manifestations and variable phenotypic expression may hinder the diagnosis, particularly in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis may be helpful to identify at-risk individuals early and start prophylactic medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FBN1 mutations have also been reported in patients with Marfan-related conditions, but it is unknown what proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> FBN1 mutation carriers they represent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the clinical and molecular data of 171 consecutive patients referred for FBN1 analysis because either <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> was diagnosed or they had signs suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We compared the incidence of mutations in patients who fulfilled the clinical diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> with those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> were fulfilled in 94 patients, 62 (66%) of whom had an FBN1 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> was found in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> with an FBN1 mutation vs those without (P=.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the 77 patients who did not meet the criteria, an FBN1 mutation was found in 9 patients (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between the severity of the phenotype and the position and nature of the FBN1 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a significant difference in the number of FBN1 mutations between patients fulfilling and those not fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, which seems to be a good predictor of the presence of an FBN1 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive clinical evaluation is mandatory before establishing a definitive diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>An FBN1 mutation analysis is helpful to identify individuals at high risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> who need careful follow-up, particularly in families displaying <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>phenotypic variability</z:hpo> and in children </plain></SENT>
