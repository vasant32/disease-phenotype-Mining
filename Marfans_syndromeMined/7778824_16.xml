<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To review the available information on the diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic aspects of cardiac complications in women with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> during the peripartum period and to develop guidelines for the approach to these patients on the basis of this information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search and a manual search of bibliographies from reviewed articles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles that reported on pregnancy in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> or that discussed potentially relevant aspects of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pregnancy in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is associated with two primary problems: potential catastrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and the risk for having a child with the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk for peripartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> is especially high in women in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> is diagnosed before pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gestation seems to be safer in women without preexisting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>; however, an event-free pregnancy cannot be guaranteed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is inherited in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> manner, and the fetus has a 50% risk for inheriting the mutant gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Women with the syndrome should be counseled before conception about the risks of pregnancy to both mother and fetus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because preconceptual <z:hpo ids='HP_0005111'>dilatation of the ascending aorta</z:hpo> seems to be an important predictor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, it should be excluded before pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiography seems to be preferable for noninvasive assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> before and during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic use of beta-blockers may be useful in preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Surgery should be considered during gestation in patients with progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> when or before the aortic root reaches 5.5 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because of the potential risk of ionizing radiation to the fetus, noninvasive methods such as transesophageal echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging are preferred to contrast aortography for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Vaginal delivery can be done in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who do not have cardiovascular system abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, or other important <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo>, cesarean section should be the preferred method of delivery </plain></SENT>
