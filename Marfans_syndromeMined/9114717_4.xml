<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It rarely is due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e>, but deserves careful evaluation for this possibility, with laboratory tests performed in limited cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The child who has pain of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> that interferes with sleep, is precipitated by exercise, or is associated with dizziness, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, or <z:mp ids='MP_0001954'>shortness of breath</z:mp> should be evaluated with the aid of laboratory tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This includes at least a chest radiograph and electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, pain in the child who has a history of coin ingestion, trauma, previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e>, or conditions that put him or her at risk for developing cardiac pathology deserve further study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Likewise, those who have a history of conditions such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> warrant special consideration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, most of those who have an abnormal physical examination (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo>, abnormal breath sounds, <z:mp ids='MP_0006114'>cardiac murmur</z:mp>, abnormal rhythm or heart sounds, palpable subcutaneous air, or obvious trauma) also require a chest radiograph and an electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the child who has <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> physical examination with no worrisome history needs reassurance and careful follow-up rather than extensive studies </plain></SENT>
