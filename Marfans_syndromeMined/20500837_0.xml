<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Right axillary artery cannulation confers significant advantages, because it provides antegrade arterial perfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass, and allows continuous antegrade cerebral perfusion during hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e>, thereby minimizing global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, right axillary artery cannulation has been associated with serious complications, including problems with systemic perfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass, problems with postoperative patency of the artery due to stenosis, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or dissection, and brachial plexus injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We herein present the case of a 36-year-old Caucasian man with known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, who had direct right axillary artery cannulation for surgery of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, the patient developed an axillary perigraft seroma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As this complication has, not, to our knowledge, been reported before in cardiothoracic surgery, we describe this unusual complication and discuss conservative and surgical treatment options </plain></SENT>
