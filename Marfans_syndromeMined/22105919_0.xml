<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic procedures before disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and the mechanisms involved in the transition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aortic tissue to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We determined signs of descending <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> before disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in mice with a mutation in the fibrillin 1 gene (Fbn1(+/C1039G)), a validated mouse model of disease susceptibility and progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed a tubular unfixed non-aneurysmal descending thoracic aorta from 8-month-old <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and Fbn1(+/C1039G) mice by a tubular biaxial tester that works in conjunction with a two-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> nonlinear microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fbn1(+/C1039G) mouse aorta was more compliant in the circumferential direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> imaging showed defective organization of adventitial collagen fibers in the pressurized aortas of Fbn1(+/C1039G) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, disruption in the elastic lamina was noted in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in pressurized aortas but not unpressurized aortas of Fbn1(+/C1039G) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the molecular level, this altered tissue behavior in non-aneurysmal descending aortas of Fbn1(+/C1039G) mice was accompanied by an increasing trend of canonical but not noncanonical, transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, assays of in vitro collagen lattice formation in mouse <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and TGFβ1-deficient embryonic fibroblasts indicate that TGFβ1 can regulate collagen organization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ability to reveal the presence of altered biomechanics and microstructure coupled with subtle changes in TGFβ signaling provides a novel surrogate measure of tissue susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> before disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
