<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The tissues are often fragile, contributing to the risk of haemorrhage and postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the past surgery has been directed towards minimising haemorrhage by wraparound techniques and the right atrial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> method of Cabrol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, recent use of aortic homografts, collagen-impregnated grafts and tissue glues have reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and simplified operative technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> and total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> allows <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> resection to extend into the aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Between 1986 and 1991 25 aortic root replacements were carried out at the Oxford Heart Centre in 21- to 76-year-olds, 13 for aorto-annular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> (4 due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>), 7 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (2 Marfan's syndrome) and 2 for complications of previous aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients had homograft root replacement for aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We implanted 14 Medtronic composite grafts, 1 St Jude conduit and 7 collagen-coated Dacron grafts (Hemashield, Meadox) into which a Starr-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Edwards</z:e> valve was sewn, as well as 3 homografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient with a massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection following previous aortic valve replacement required an interposition graft to the coronary ostia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the others, the coronary ostia were mobilised from the native aorta and directly implanted into the conduit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In dissections a ring of pericardium or GoreTex was used to buttress the coronary anastomoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six patients also required coronary artery grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Native aorta was excised and not wrapped around the conduit </plain></SENT>
