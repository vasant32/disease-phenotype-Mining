<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are characterized by teeth anomalies associated with system anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study is an analysis of single dental anomaly cases in personally observed syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The dental arch radiographs of 8 patients suffering from hereditary syndromes characterized by teeth anomalies have been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0000164'>dental anomalies</z:hpo> have been classified--from an anatomic-clinical viewpoint--as to number (missing/exceeding teeth), shape, position, volume (too much/too little), eruption (early/late, till inclusion) and structure (enamel, dentine, cement) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For each syndrome, the kind of transmission, the kind of dental anomaly (isolated or associated), the prevailing, the kind of association among the various <z:hpo ids='HP_0000164'>dental anomalies</z:hpo> have been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The most frequently observed anomaly among the examined syndromes has been the number associated to shape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 95.4% of the specimen presented association between different <z:hpo ids='HP_0000164'>dental anomalies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of the observation confirm the well documented ontogenetic and etiopathogenetic relationship between genetics, dental genesis, morphogenesis, teeth eruption and growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000164'>Dental anomalies</z:hpo> observation should direct the surgeon towards considering the presence of other signs and symptoms when tracing out probable and more complex--sometimes recessive--syndrome outlines </plain></SENT>
