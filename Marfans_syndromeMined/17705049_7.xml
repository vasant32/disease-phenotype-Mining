<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutant mice (Tsk/+) display a tightness of skin in the interscapular region, lung <z:hpo ids='HP_0002097'>emphysema</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0010633'>myocardial hypertrophy</z:mp>, skeletal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is hypothesized in this study that in Tsk mice the mutation in Fbn1 alters bone cell metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A detailed study of the Tsk skeletal phenotype revealed that Tsk mice have significantly longer femurs and axial skeleton as well as vertebral abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cortical and trabecular bone volumes were significantly decreased in Tsk femurs from 2- and 4-month-old mice (13% and 39%, respectively) as well as trabecular thickness, number, connectivity, and surface area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These skeletal differences were also associated with a reduction in bone mineral density in mutant mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of the osteoblast-specific genes Col1a1, BSP and OC was examined in marrow stromal cell cultures at various time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A decrease in the rate of maturation of the Tsk cells was indicated by a delay in the appearance of OC expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These initial experiments demonstrated a significant role of the fibrillin 1 protein in the extracellular matrix of bone cells </plain></SENT>
