<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1975 and 2004, a total of 81 patients (55 males, 26 females; mean age 58 +/- 18 years) underwent aortic root replacement with the Hancock conduit for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (n = 22; 27%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> (n = 57; 70%), or porcelain aorta (n = 2; 3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients (31%) underwent an emergency operation, 12 (15%) presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and eight (10%) had undergone previous cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Concomitant procedures were performed in 26 cases (32%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The follow up was 98% complete; the mean follow up was 4.8 +/- 4.0 years (range: 1 day to 16.7 years), and the cumulative follow up was 403 patient-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Actuarial event-free rates were calculated, and valve-related complications classified according to guidelines for reporting morbidity and mortality after cardiac valvular operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were seven (9%) operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and four (5%) in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival rates at five and 10 years (excluding operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>) were 77.0 +/- 5.3% and 54.0 +/- 7.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Actuarial freedom from aortic valve reoperation at five and 10 years was 98 +/- 1.6% and 64 +/- 10.2%, from structural valve deterioration 88.1 +/- 4.7% and 49.9 +/- 9.6%, from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> 87.4 +/- 4.6% and 75.1 +/- 9.5%, and from major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> events 90.2 +/- 3.9% and 75.4 +/- 8.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among redo procedures, the stentless Hancock valve could be excised without separating the synthetic graft from the left ventricular outflow tract, and a stented valve prosthesis thus implanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hence, it was possible to avoid a second Bentall operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The long-term survival rates after aortic root replacement with the bioprosthetic Hancock conduit were reasonable for this demanding patient cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the durability of the prosthesis was inferior to that reported for the stented Hancock valve substitute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The key benefit of this bioprosthetic valved conduit was the simplified redo procedure </plain></SENT>
