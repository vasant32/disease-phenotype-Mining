<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cysteine substitutions that disrupt one of the three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bonds are frequent causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified 19 new substitutions involving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32460">cysteine residues</z:chebi> in each of the six positions of EGF-like domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Allele-specific <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> assays revealed equal abundance of mutant and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> FBN1 transcripts in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 individuals studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative pulse-chase analysis of fibrillin protein was performed on 25 mutant fibroblast strains with substitutions of 22 different <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32460">cysteine residues</z:chebi> in 18 different EGF-like domains spanning the entire gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> synthesis and stability of mutant fibrillin molecules was seen in 20/25 individuals, 11 of whom showed delayed intracellular processing and/or secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the remaining five cases, the mutant protein was apparently unstable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In four of these five cases, the second or third <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bond of EGF-like domains immediately preceding an 8-cysteine or hybrid domain was affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but two mutations caused severe reduction of matrix deposition, which was attributed to a dominant-negative effect of mutant molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For genotype/phenotype comparisons, clinical data on 25 probands and 19 mutation-positive family members were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ocular manifestations were among the most consistent features (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> in 86%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo> in 80%) </plain></SENT>
