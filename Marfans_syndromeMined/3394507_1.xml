<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment was started at a chronological age of 12.0 +/- 0.5 years and height of 173.0 +/- 3.1 cm (means +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Skeletal age was 12.4 +/- 0.2 years and Bayley-Pinneau final height prediction 186.3 +/- 1.4 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">Estrogen</z:chebi> treatment for 2.0 +/- 0.4 years resulted in final height of 184.1 +/- 0.2 cm (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The weight increased with 7.8 +/- 2.7 kg during the treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present results indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> treatment may be effective in reducing adult height in girls with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, but that the effect is probably less than that observed in normally tall girls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This may probably be explained by the rather late start of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No immediate effects on aortic root diameters were observed </plain></SENT>
