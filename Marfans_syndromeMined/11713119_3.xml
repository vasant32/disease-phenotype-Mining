<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To examine the prevalence and nature of craniofacial abnormalities in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and to investigate the relationship between craniofacial abnormalities and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> (OSA) severity in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> clinic in a tertiary teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Fifteen consecutive adult patients (7 men and 8 women; mean [+/- SD] age, 34.8 +/- 13.2 years) who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Apneic status was determined from standard overnight polysomnography testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Measurements from standardized lateral cephalometric radiographs were compared to normative data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients had OSA, which was defined as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>/<z:mp ids='MP_0001956'>hypopnea</z:mp> index (AHI) of &gt; 5 episodes per hour (mean AHI, 22 +/- 15 episodes per hour) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A high prevalence of craniofacial abnormalities was found with significant gender differences for some of the variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant abnormalities for the entire group were bimaxillary retrusion, a reduced maxillary length, an increased total anterior face height, a long lower anterior face height, an obtuse gonial angle, a steep mandibular plane, a reduced posterior nasal airway height, a reduced posterior airway space, and an increased distance from the mandibular plane to the hyoid bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis revealed significant correlations among the total anterior face height, the upper anterior and posterior face heights, the mandibular length, and AHI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between the rank of the number of cephalometric abnormalities per patient and AHI in those patients with OSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Craniofacial abnormalities are common in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The relationship between some cephalometric parameters and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> severity suggests a potential role of craniofacial structure in the pathogenesis of OSA in these patients </plain></SENT>
