<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently found that fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 control bone formation by regulating osteoblast differentiation through the differential modulation of endogenous TGFβ and bone morphogenetic protein signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe in vivo and ex vivo experiments that implicate the fibrillins as negative regulators of bone resorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult Fbn2(-/-) mice display a greater than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> osteolytic response to locally implanted <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi>-coated <z:chebi fb="55" ids="33341">titanium</z:chebi> particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although isolated cultures of Fbn2(-/-) preosteoclasts exhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> differentiation and activity, these features were substantially augmented when mutant or <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> preosteoclasts were co-cultured with Fbn2(-/-) but not <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Greater osteoclastogenic potential of Fbn2(-/-) osteoblasts was largely accounted for by up-regulation of the Rankl gene secondary to heightened TGFβ activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This conclusion was based on the findings that blockade of TGFβ signaling blunts Rankl up-regulation in Fbn2(-/-) osteoblasts and bones and that systemic TGFβ antagonism improves locally induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002797'>osteolysis</z:hpo> in Fbn2(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Abnormally high Rankl expression secondary to elevated TGFβ activity was also noted in cultured osteoblasts from Fbn1(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Collectively our data demonstrated that extracellular microfibrils balance local catabolic and anabolic signals during bone remodeling in addition to implying distinct mechanisms of bone loss in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and congenital contractural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
