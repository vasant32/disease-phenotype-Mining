<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We compared results of the Bentall procedure with valve-sparing aortic root replacement (VSRR) for aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> patients who had the Bentall procedure or VSRR at our institution between April 1997 and September 2006 were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up information was obtained from hospital charts and contact with patients or their physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier survival and propensity score analyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred forty <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> patients had either the Bentall procedure (n = 56) or VSRR (n = 84; 40 remodeling and 44 reimplantation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bentall patients were older than VSRR patients (38 versus 29 years; p = 0.0001) and had more <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> (16% versus 1%; p = 0.0012); more urgent/emergent surgery (20% versus 2%; p = 0.0008); larger preoperative sinus diameter (5.7 versus 5.1 cm; p = 0.0004); and more preoperative 3+/4+ <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> (59% versus 10%; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, 9% Bentall patients (5 of 56) and 1% of VSRR patients (1 of 84) suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two percent (1 of 56) of Bentall patients required reoperation on the aortic root versus 6% of VSRR patients (5 of 84; p = 0.40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eight-year freedom from aortic valve replacement was 90% for VSRR patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eight-year survival was 90% for Bentall and 100% for VSRR patients (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Propensity-adjusted regression showed that the Bentall procedure did not predict mortality (p = 1.00) and did not protect from reoperation (odds ratio = 0.28; 95% confidence interval: 0.01 to 4.33; p = 0.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Bentall procedure and VSRR have similar operative results in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The procedures are distinguished by higher rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> among Bentall patients and higher rates of reoperation among VSRR patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Lower late survival among Bentall patients probably reflects the preferential use of the Bentall procedure for higher risk patients </plain></SENT>
