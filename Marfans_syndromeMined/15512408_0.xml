<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few district hospital obstetricians except those who work in areas with Marfan family clusters have experience in managing patients with this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Modern medical and surgical treatments have resulted in improved longevity and quality of life for many with this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For these reasons, there is an increased likelihood that more obstetricians may in the future have to manage a pregnant Marfan patient even though their involvement may only be in the early stages of her pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is important that every district hospital obstetrician is aware of the implications of the condition in pregnancy and has a clear idea of the principles of management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This paper is based on experience gained from working in a district hospital in an area with a cluster of Marfan families and review of the relevant medical literature </plain></SENT>
