<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>General anesthesia was maintained using <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> and remifentanil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The procedure was performed examining the motor evoked potential (<z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi>) and somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) of the lower extremities with the patient placed in the prone position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The procedure was completed successfully without major cardiovascular or respiratory complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The duration of anesthesia was 821 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When drapes were removed, we noticed that the right shoulder was in a hyperabduction position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After emergence from anesthesia, it was observed that the right upper extremity was paralyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, brachial plexus injury, which may have been due to intraoperative malpositioning, was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brachial plexus injury is the most common among the nerve injuries resulting from intraoperative malpositioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with EDS are thought to be at high risk for the complications and it has also been reported that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001382'>joint hypermobility</z:hpo>, such as that in EDS or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, are highly susceptible to nerve injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative monitoring of the <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> and SSEP in the upper extremities should be considered for early detection and prevention of brachial plexus injury in patients with EDS who are thought to be at high risk </plain></SENT>
