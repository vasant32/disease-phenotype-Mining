<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The anatomical substrate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> is a degeneration of elastic fibres and disorganization of the collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is now known that these lesions are due to mutation of genes localised on chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first of them (FBN1) codes for the main constitutive protein of the elastic tissue: fibrillin 1, present mainly in structures which must resist load and stress (aortic adventitia, the suspending ligament of the lens, skin); the second (FBN2) codes for fibrillin 2: responsible for the orientation of the elastin and mainly present in cartilage, the aortic media, the bronchi, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tissues rich in elastin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations of FBN1 are very common and are associated not only with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> but also fibrillinopathies: incomplete forms, neonatal forms, ectopic lens, isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the thoracic aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The widespread distribution of fibrillin explains the pleiotropic nature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and its clinical presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The variability of interfamilial expression is due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> (at least two genes) and alletic differences (different mutations of FBN1 from one family to another), also explaining mild forms due to quantitative reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fibrillin and severe forms by "negative dominance" where the fibrillin is structurally abnormal because of alteration of the polymerisation mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The biologic diagnosis of fibrillopathy can be made by a protein test analysing fibrillin on a culture of the patient's fibroblast obtained by skin biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At present, molecular diagnosis of the mutation within the FBN1 gene is not feasible as a routine procedure </plain></SENT>
