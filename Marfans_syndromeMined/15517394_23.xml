<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin-1 is the main component of the 10- to 12-nm microfibrils that together with elastin form elastic fibers found in tissues such as the aortic media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, FBN1 mutations have been shown to increase the susceptibility of fibrillin-1 to proteolysis in vitro, and other findings suggest that up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), as well as fragmentation of microfibrils, could play a role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present work, we have investigated the influence of fibrillin-1 fragments on the expression of MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-3 in a cell culture system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cultured human dermal fibroblasts were incubated with several different recombinant fibrillin-1 fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression level of MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-3, was determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and the concentration of the corresponding proteins was estimated by quantitative Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results establish that treatment of cultured human dermal fibroblasts with recombinant fibrillin-1 fragments containing the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) integrin-binding motif of fibrillin-1 induces up-regulation of MMP-1 and MMP-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A similar effect was seen upon stimulation with a synthetic RGD <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of MMP-2 was not influenced by treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest the possibility that fibrillin fragments could themselves have pathogenic effects by leading to up-regulation of MMPs, which in turn may be involved in the progressive breakdown of microfibrils thought to play a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
