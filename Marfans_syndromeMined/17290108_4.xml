<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> leading to a so-called '<z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of the vessel wall' and predisposing certain individuals to dissection has often been postulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of connective tissue, a main component of vessel wall and environment, was investigated in carotids and skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While the overall <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of dermal connective tissue is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, about half of patients with sCAD show mild ultrastructural connective tissue alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These ultrastructural morphological aberrations can be designated either as '<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e> (EDS) III-like', resembling mild findings in patients with the hypermobility type of EDS (EDS III); or coined 'EDS IV-like' with collagen fibers containing fibrils with highly variable diameters resembling mild findings in vascular EDS; or the abnormalities are restricted to the elastic fibers (with fragmentation and minicalcifications) without significant alterations in the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the collagen fibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings had some similarity with the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> found in heterozygous carriers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033847" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PXE">pseudoxanthoma elasticum</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A grading scale according to the severity of the findings has been introduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar connective tissue abnormalities were detected in some first-degree relatives of patients with sCAD showing hereditary at least in a subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They can serve as a phenotypic marker for further genetic studies in patients with sCAD and large families to possibly identify the underlying basic molecular defect(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Very few of patients (&lt;5%) with sCAD and connective tissue abnormalities have clinical manifestations of skin, joint, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>skeletal abnormalities</z:hpo> of a defined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heritable connective tissue disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In specimens of arterial walls of carotid, aortic, and renal arteries of patients with sCAD, pronounced systemic, histopathological, and ultrastructural abnormalities were detected with elastic fiber fragmentation and medial degeneration, described before only in a few patients with known hereditary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e> such as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that a major part of sCAD cases represents a manifestation of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> with a vascular phenotype </plain></SENT>
