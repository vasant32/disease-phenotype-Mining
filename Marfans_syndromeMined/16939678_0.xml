<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Manifestations of the disorder primarily affect the skeletal, cardiovascular, and ocular systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The phenotypic manifestations of this disorder can be quite variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The major cause of morbidity and mortality in this patient population is the cardiovascular manifestations of the disorder: aortic root dilation and dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individuals with this disorder are at risk for catastrophic cardiovascular events, most often as a result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the incidence of dissection in childhood is exceedingly low, the background of a progressively dilating aortic root appears to be the major factor contributing to this risk in adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is beneficial to identify affected individuals as early as possible to institute lifestyle changes and medical therapy in an effort to enhance their long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Familial screening, once a case has been identified, and consideration of genetic screening of an affected family may also be helpful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Medical therapy with beta blockers, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi>, and/or angiotensin inhibitors has been shown to be somewhat effective in slowing the rate of growth of the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Exciting new data suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> may provide an even greater degree of protection from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite medical therapy, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> do have progressive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of their aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> increases with increasing size of the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic surgical techniques have been successful in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, resulting in a longer average life span in this patient population </plain></SENT>
