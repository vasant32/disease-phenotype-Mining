<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>phenotypic variability</z:hpo> observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> makes genetic counselling difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prenatal diagnosis (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PND</z:e>) and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are technically feasible when a causal mutation is identified, but both raise many ethical questions in this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Little is known about opinions and practices in such reproductive issues in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to report on patients' points of view and geneticists' standard practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two different questionnaires were produced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty geneticists filled in the questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two per cent thought that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PND</z:e> was acceptable, 72% debatable and 6% not acceptable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preimplantation genetic diagnosis was more often reported acceptable (34% of answers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results varied according to the physician's experience with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four answers were collected for patients' questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most of them (74%) were favourable to the development of prenatal testing, and believed that the choice should be given to parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, only a minority would opt for prenatal diagnosis for themselves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study showed that the majority of patients were in favour of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PND</z:e> and that opinions among practitioners varied widely, but that overall, practitioners favoured a systematic multidisciplinary evaluation of the couple's request </plain></SENT>
