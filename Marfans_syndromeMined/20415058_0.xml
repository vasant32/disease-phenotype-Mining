<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> adversely impacts the cardiovascular outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> patients is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective was to investigate the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> and to define whether its combined presence would adversely impact cardiovascular outcome in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective review on a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> database from a single center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparisons between patients with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> were performed by chi2 or Student t test as appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>Bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> was found in 4 of 89 Marfan syndrome patients (two males; mean age 21.5 +/- 13 years) for 4.5% prevalence; in contrast, 1.5% prevalence was found in 200 control subjects (p = 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> is separately discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> shows trends for association with <z:mp ids='MP_0010574'>aortic dilation</z:mp> (Odds ratio [OR] 4.2; 95% Confidence interval [95% CI] 0.2-81), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (OR 5.5; 95% CI 0.7-42), while negative association with the Walker-Murdoch sign (OR 0.07; 95% CI 0.006-0.73) was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> patients is 4.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While it is intriguing and even intuitive that the concurrence of both conditions would lead to more aggressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e>, a true synergistic role for aortic wall weakening cannot be supported </plain></SENT>
