<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The associated clinical and prognostic spectra remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Clinical features and outcomes of 71 patients with a TGFBR2 mutation (TGFBR2 group) were compared with 50 age- and sex-matched unaffected family members (control subjects) and 243 patients harboring FBN1 mutations (FBN1 group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>Aortic dilatation</z:hpo> was present in a similar proportion of patients in both the TGFBR2 and FBN1 groups (78% versus 79%, respectively) but was highly variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence and average age for thoracic aortic surgery (31% versus 27% and 35+/-16 versus 39+/-13 years, respectively) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (14% versus 10% and 38+/-12 versus 39+/-9 years) were also similar in the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mitral valve involvement (myxomatous, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo>) was less frequent in the TGFBR2 than in the FBN1 group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>Aortic dilatation</z:hpo>, dissection, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> was the index event leading to genetic diagnosis in 65% of families with TGFBR2 mutations, versus 32% with FBN1 mutations (P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was greater in TGFBR2 families before diagnosis but similar once the disease had been recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most pregnancies were uneventful (without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>) in both TGFBR2 and FBN1 families (38 of 39 versus 213 of 217; P=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (10%) with a TGFBR2 mutation fulfilled international criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, 3 of whom presented with features specific for Loeys-Dietz syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinical outcomes appear similar between treated patients with TGFBR2 mutations and individuals with FBN1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prognosis depends on clinical disease expression and treatment rather than simply the presence of a TGFBR2 gene mutation </plain></SENT>
