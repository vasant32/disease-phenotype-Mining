<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are, however, many factors creating problems in the firm establishment of the correct diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After the identification of the defective gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, fibrillin 1 (FBN1), several mutations in this gene have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since so far <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one of the mutations in FBN1 have been family specific, a common diagnostic DNA test for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients is not to be expected in the near future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we have utilized four polymorphic markers in the diagnostics in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> families from different populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of the markers, FBN1a and a novel FBN1b, are intragenic markers of FBN1 and two others, D15S103 (G113) and CYP19, are very close to and most probably flank FBN1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combined use of the multiallelic markers proved highly useful in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> diagnostics providing informativeness in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> analysed families </plain></SENT>
