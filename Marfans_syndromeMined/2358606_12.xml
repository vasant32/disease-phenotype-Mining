<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ninety-three patients were diagnosed as having cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> at the Cleveland Clinic between July 1963 and December 1987 (72% men aged 26 to 77 years, mean 55) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-eight percent of the patients had a diastolic murmur and chest roentgenogram revealed a dilated aortic arch in 58% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001640'>cardiomegaly</z:hpo> in 63% </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up, obtained on 90 (97%) of the 93 patients, ranged in duration from 0 to 137 months (mean 29) </plain></SENT>
