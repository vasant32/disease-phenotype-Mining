<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> expressivity is variable, and its diagnosis relies completely on clinical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Atypical cases and Marfan-like (marfanoid) clinical presentations are commonly found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The metacarpophalangeal pattern profile (MCPP), a radiological method in which the 19 tubular hand bones are assessed, has been used in the diagnosis of various syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether the MCPP was adequate to discriminate between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and Marfan-like subjects, we studied 38 patients who were referred to our service because they had an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> diagnosis, diagnostic hypothesis, or differential diagnosis or had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001519'>dolichostenomelia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two groups were formed: 1) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>: 21 patients with a mean age of 18.3 (10.8 S.D.) years and 2) Marfan-like syndromes: 16 patients who did not meet the current criteria, with a mean age of 14.6 (4.6 S.D.) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The MCPP was performed in each case following the classical technique, and a characteristic mean profile was obtained for group I (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>), with Z scores ranging from 0.69 to 2.73 (1.80+/-0.50; mean+/-S.D.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In group I, three cases had no correlation with the typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In group II, three cases had an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The correlation with the mean MCPP of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> permitted the differential diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and marfanoid syndromes with 86% sensitivity, 81% specificity, and 86% positive and 81% negative predictive values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that MCPP can be used effectively as an auxiliary tool in the nosology of these conditions and, because there is no change in MCPP with age, can be helpful in early diagnosis </plain></SENT>
