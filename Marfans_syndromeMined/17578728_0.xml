<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Affected individuals have impaired flow-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> (FMD) of large arteries of a similar severity to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Skeletal muscle bioenergetics were studied in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in order to evaluate the impact of impaired flow-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> on skeletal muscle metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Skeletal muscle metabolism is abnormal in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> and the aetiology is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen patients and 12 controls were studied by <z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">phosphorus</z:chebi> Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy of the calf muscle using an incremental exercise protocol and by Magnetic Resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Metabolic variables measured at rest were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For a similar total work output measured at end of the standardized incremental exercise, the total rate of energy consumption (EC) was significantly increased in patients (21.2 +/- 2.3 mM ATP/min/W vs 13.6 +/- 1.4 mM ATP/min/W in controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, both PCr and pH time-dependent changes were significantly different between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The absolute contributions of aerobic and glycolytic pathways to energy production were significantly higher in patients whereas they were similar when expressed relative to EC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The higher EC measured in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> was supported by both oxidative and anaerobic metabolic pathways, thereby suggesting a decrease in muscle efficiency and/or muscle mass, as previously described in other diseases affecting skeletal muscle function such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
