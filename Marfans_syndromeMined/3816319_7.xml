<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For ten subjects, there were matched, related control subjects who did not have a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients had lower values of FVC and TLC than the values expected for their standing heights (83 and 91 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, when sitting height was used to calculate expected spirometric values, patients free of severe deformity of the thoracic cage did not have significant spirometric abnormalities (FVC 105 percent, FEV1 92 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, patients with moderate-to-severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> (common features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>) had marked reductions in total lung capacity as well as in FVC and FEV1, suggesting a restrictive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0231926" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ventilatory defect</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The abnormalities of pulmonary function often found in clinical laboratories can be explained in most cases by inappropriate use of standing height to calculate expected values, by thoracic cage deformity, or by both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have found no evidence from standard tests of pulmonary function for a connective tissue defect of lung parenchyma that is of clinical importance in Marfan patients who lack chest wall deformity </plain></SENT>
