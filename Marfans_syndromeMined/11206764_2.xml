<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Study results were analyzed with reference to long-term survival, morbidity and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-four Marfan patients (51 males, 23 females; mean age 41+/-14 years), underwent first-time aortic surgery between 1977 and 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow up information regarding mortality, morbidity and functional status was obtained from patient records and by questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean follow up was 5 years (range: 0-19 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven patients (64%) had a dissection, 27 (36%) an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, and 45 (61%) patients underwent emergency operations (&lt;4 h from arrival at hospital) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 72 patients (97%) the disease affected the ascending aorta, and implantation of a composite graft was the most frequent operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall 30-day mortality was 12% (3% in elective cases, 18% in emergency cases, p &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Emergency operations and surgery extended to the aortic arch were risk factors for early mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall actuarial survival was 63.4+/-8% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Age was the only risk factor for late mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients were reoperated on due to pathologies of the remaining aorta (n = 12), pseudoaneurysms (n = 4) and aortic valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A total of five patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>; one patient with a homograft required surgery, and medical treatment was successful in the other four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Five patients had neurological thromboembolic episodes without permanent damage, and six had minor <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Freedom from early and late mortality, reoperation on the aorta and major cardiovascular events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> episodes, thromboembolic/hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and other major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>/embolic episodes) was 33.3 +/- 8.1% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>At follow up, 98% of patients were in NYHA functional class I or II, and 80% were working </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Elective aortic surgery in Marfan patients can be performed with good results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Close follow up of patients undergoing surgery is important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The long-term functional status of surviving patients is satisfactory </plain></SENT>
