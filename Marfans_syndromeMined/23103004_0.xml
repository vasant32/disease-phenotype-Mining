<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of the VSRR is less well defined for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo>, severe <z:mp ids='MP_0006047'>aortic valve insufficiency</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart defects</z:hpo>, and type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the clinical outcome of patients who underwent VSRR for expanded indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-eight patients underwent VSRR between the 2005 and 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two patients (92%) underwent reimplantation and 6 patients (8%) were operated on with the remodeling technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 51 ± 12 years (range 24 to 73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For 71 patients (91%), the operation was elective, and for 7 (9%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>), on an emergency basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively, the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> was graded as 2+ or greater for 27 patients (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Connective tissue disorder</z:e> (Marfan or Loeys-Dietz), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> was present in 15 (19%), 15 (19%), and 7 patients (9%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Concomitant aortic valve leaflet repair was performed for 39 patients (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up time was 2.4 ± 1.7 years (range, 0.1 to 7.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-day mortality was zero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The rate of postoperative complications was low: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> 3%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> 3%, prosthesis <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> 1%, and low cardiac output syndrome 1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Survival was 100% at 1 year and 97% at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Freedom from recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0006047'>aortic valve insufficiency</z:mp> (≥2+) during the follow-up was 94% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The midterm results of VSRR in terms of survival, freedom from recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0006047'>aortic valve insufficiency</z:mp>, and the need for reoperation are excellent, even for high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
