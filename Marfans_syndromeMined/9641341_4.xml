<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aims to compare long-term results of surgically treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and dissections in patients with and without MfS in respect to early and late prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From March 1975 to August 1994, 33 patients with classic MfS (group A, age 34.2 +/- 9 years) and 298 patients with non-fibrillinopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> (group B, age 54 +/- 13 years) underwent aortic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> dissections occurred in 57.6 (A) versus 37.9% (B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 54.6% of patients in group A were treated with a composite graft versus 16.4% in B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aortic arch and the descending aorta was replaced in 30.4% of MfS patients and 24.9% of patients without MfS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed 7 (25.0%, A) versus 35 (14.2%, B) late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> among the 28 (A) versus 247 (B) early survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 5 patients (17.9%) of A and 8 patients (3.2%) of B, late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was caused by redissection or recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Long-term survival after 5, 10 and 15 years in group A was 82 +/- 7, 60 +/- 11 and 30 +/- 22%, and 75 +/- 3, 69 +/- 3 and 64 +/- 4% in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of 22 reoperations were performed in 11 MfS patients, 17 reoperations were due to recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three of the 8 patients underwent reoperation after Wheat procedure because of sinus valsalva <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the patients with composite graft replacement needed reoperation in this segment, but 3 patients suffered from redissection at the proximal aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In group B, reoperations were significantly less frequent (10.7%) compared to MfS patients (66.7%; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> in MfS patients is associated with a high risk of redissection and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>If the ascending aorta needs to be replaced, we recommend the composite graft technique and a more aggressive approach to reduce the frequency of distal reoperations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In order to reduce the high reoperation rate in MfS patients, frequent clinical follow-up may contribute to improve life expectancy in MfS patients </plain></SENT>
