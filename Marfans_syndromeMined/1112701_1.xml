<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results with non-cloth-covered and cloth-covered valves were analyzed with actuarial techniques and were compared in terms of late survival, thromboembolic complication rate, reoperation rate and the influence of anticoagulation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cloth-covered prostheses have substantially lowered the incidence of emboli after mitral replacement, and have thus far eliminated emboli after aortic replacement in patients receiving <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although anticoagulation therapy is still necessary, a clinical trial is currently in progress to assess the adequacy of antiplatelet drugs </plain></SENT>
