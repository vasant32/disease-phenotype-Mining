<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000218'>high palates</z:hpo> were significantly taller than Swedes of the same sex and age (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Established <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo> was not found in the examined sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sucking habits neither seem to influence crowding nor the palatal dimension at the molar region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mouthbreathing strengthened but was not a pre-requisite for the significant correlation between palatal height and body height </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The predominant orthodontic diagnoses included crowding, extreme maxillary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011095'>overjet</z:hpo> and postnormal occlusion as can be expected in a sample of orthodontic patients </plain></SENT>
