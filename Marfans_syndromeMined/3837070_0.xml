<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to determine the usefulness of two-dimensional echocardiographic measurements of the surgical aortic ring diameters (ARDs) in predicting correct sizes of the prosthetic valves and in determining the mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> who underwent prosthetic valve surgery, and 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were selected for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 40 patients consisted of 21 with rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> (RHD group), and 19 with non-rheumatic non-inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> (non-RHD group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>Aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> due to annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> with or without the stigmata of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valves</z:hpo> were excluded from the non-RHD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic estimates of the ARDs proved to be useful for predicting prosthetic valve sizes considering the good correlation between the echocardiographic and direct measurements (r = 0.814), despite a slight tendency to echocardiographic underestimation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ARDs was 24.7 +/- 3 mm in the RHD group, 28.8 +/- 2.9 mm in the non-RHD group and 21.8 +/- 1.7 mm in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ARDs in the RHD group was significantly larger than that of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (p less than 0.001), and the ARDs of the non-RHD group was significantly larger than that of the RHD group (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were loose correlations between the ARDs and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, and between the ARDs and left ventricular end-systolic dimension in the RHD group (r = 0.549 and r = 0.455, respectively), but there were no correlations between these two parameters in the non-RHD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> in the non-RHD group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> coexisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both the ARDs and the mitral ring dimension were markedly increased in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that in the non-RHD group, marked <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the ARDs appears to be one of the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
