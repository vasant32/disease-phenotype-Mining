<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the distribution and structure of fibrillin microfibrils in the three fibrillin-rich lens capsule zones of subjects with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Capsules were dissected from nine lenses extracted intracapsularly from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The capsules were divided and mounted flat on gelatin-coated glass slides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ABC immunoperoxidase staining with monoclonal anti-fibrillin antibody was used to visualize and localize fibrillin in these specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The staining patterns and microscopic structure of microfibrils were compared to those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no bundles of fibrillin fibers in Zone I - a 0.75-mm wide peripheral ring of the anterior capsule that normally contains radial bunches of fibrillin fibers; instead, fine disorganized fibrillin-positive fragments were dispersed in this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The size and shape of the fragments varied among patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lenses, there was only light staining for fibrillin in Zone II - a 1-mm wide meshwork of normally fibrillin-rich fibers that encircles the equator and serves as an insertion platform for most zonular fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The radial periodic bands of Zone III - a 0.1-mm wide ring on the most peripheral part of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> posterior capsule - were identifiable in some samples, but stained only faintly for fibrillin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Fibrillin microfibrils are disrupted and fragmented in the lens capsule of patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The qualitative, quantitative, and structural abnormalities of fibrillin deposition in the lens capsule of these patients support a causal relationship to lens abnormalities in this disease </plain></SENT>
