<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (63%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, 11 (69%) had annulo aortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> (AAE), and 7 (44%) had Stanford A dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two patients (12.5%) underwent emergent operation due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 2 (12.5%) operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, and both were Stanford A dissection without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although there was no statistical significance, the operative mortality was higher for the patients with Stanford A dissection (p = 0.087), for those with emergent operation (p = 0.074) and for those without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (p = 0.051) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall survival rates were 87.5% at 5 years and 75% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The survival rate at 8 years was significantly lower for the patients with Stanford A dissection (35.7%) as compared with non-Stanford A dissection (100%, p = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> nor AAE affected the long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The late results of composite graft replacement for the aortic root were satisfactory except for the patients with Stanford A dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was suggested that the long-term survival for Stanford A dissection was greately affected by the operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> for Stanford A dissection without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
