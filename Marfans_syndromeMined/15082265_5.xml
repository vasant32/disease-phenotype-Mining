<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Anulo-aortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> represents the most common cardiovascular manifestation requiring surgery in Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aim of this report was to analyze the type of presentation and the incidence of cardiovascular lesions and the clinical follow-up after initial surgery, mainly aortic root repair or replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1/1990 and 6/2003 a total of 71 patients (mean age 29+/-17 years, 8-65 years) received first surgical treatment at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>69 received root repair or replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>22 patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (31%), out of them, 3 pregnant females and 1 just after delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Composite graft replacement was performed in the majority of patients (61/71, 85%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aortic valve sparing root repair was performed in 7 patients, supra-coronary graft with refixation of the aortic valve in 2 and replacement of the descending aorta in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent close clinical and imaging follow-up in a specialized outpatient consultation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a mean follow-up interval of 5.2+/-1.8 years, 14 patients (20.5%) underwent a total of 27 aortic reoperations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had one and 6 patients had up to 4 reoperations; 13/14 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no hospital mortality and no major cardiac or neurologic morbidity following reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 2 patients suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type B dissection following aortic root surgery and 3 patients surprisingly died: 2 from a rupture of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-sized descending aorta and one from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These 5 patients had had uncomplicated primary aortic root operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of reoperations is significantly higher in patients who presented initially with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> than in those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In addition, this survey demonstrates that unexpected fatal outcome may appear in the remaining native aorta following uncomplicated elective aortic root surgery, even if the aorta is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-sized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A close follow-up of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Marfan patients is necessary to detect asymptomatic changes requiring surgery because complex elective redo-operations can be performed with a very low perioperative risk </plain></SENT>
