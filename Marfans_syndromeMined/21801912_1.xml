<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results of prophylactic root replacement using valve-sparing procedures (valve-sparing root replacement [VSRR]) in patients with LDS is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with clinical and genetic (transforming growth factor-β receptor mutations) evidence of LDS who underwent VSRR at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic and clinical data were obtained from hospital and follow-up clinic records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 2002 to 2009, 31 patients with a firm diagnosis of LDS underwent VSRR for aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 15 years, and 24 (77%) were children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One (3%) patient had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preoperative sinus diameter was 3.9±0.8 cm (z score 7.0±2.9) and 2 (6%) had greater than 2+ <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients (97%) underwent reimplantation procedures using a Valsalva graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 3.6 years (range, 0 to 7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient required late repair of a pseudoaneurysm at the distal aortic anastomosis, and 1 had a conversion to a David reimplantation procedure after a Florida sleeve operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No patient suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, and 1 (3%) patient experienced greater than 2+ late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No patient required late aortic valve repair or replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Loeys-Dietz syndrome is an aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> syndrome that can be addressed by prophylactic aortic root replacement with low operative risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Valve-sparing procedures have encouraging early and midterm results, similar to those in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and are an attractive option for young patients </plain></SENT>
