<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Secondary objectives are to report best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in LogMAR and compare the outcomes of patients managed conservatively with those treated surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective comparison of BCVA in patients under 50 years-old with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001132'>lens subluxation</z:hpo>, managed conservatively or surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 49 eyes of 28 patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic characteristics were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty eyes were treated surgically (40.8%) compared to 29 with medical treatment (59.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (79.6%) was diagnosed in 39 eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LogMAR BCVA post intervention was 0.35±0.31 for medical treatment and 0.39±0.32 for the surgical group, with no significant differences (P=.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Improvements in LogMAR lines were 2.7±4.2 and 4.11±4.2 (P=.35), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two eyes in the surgery group developed ocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (0.04%), none with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The final BCVA showed no significant differences in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>BCVA depends on the visual potential of the rehabilitated eye rather than a specific type of intervention </plain></SENT>
