<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Symptoms range from skeletal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo>, cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001065'>striae</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> leading to dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prenatal diagnosis was until recently mainly performed in familial cases by linkage analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, mutation detection has become available with thorough screening methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>phenotypic variability</z:hpo> observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> makes reproductive options difficult, as molecular diagnosis cannot predict clinical severity of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data are presented on 15 prenatal and/or preimplantation genetic diagnoses (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi>) in nine families, originating from Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and France </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In four families data from linkage analysis were used, whereas in five other families the causative FBN1 mutation was characterised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi> cycles in two couples led to one ongoing pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, two amniocenteses and nine chorionic villus (CV) samplings were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In five pregnancies an affected fetus was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In one of them, the couple chose to continue the pregnancy and an affected child was born, whereas the other four couples decided to terminate the pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is expected that the greater availability of mutation testing of the FBN1 gene will increase requests for prenatal diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi> appears to be an acceptable alternative for couples facing ethical reproductive dilemmas </plain></SENT>
