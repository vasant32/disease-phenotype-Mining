<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heritable connective tissue disorder</z:e> usually caused by a mutation in the fibrillin 1 (FBN1) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Typical characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> that have been described include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001519'>dolichostenomelia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, there is great clinical variability in the expression of the syndrome's manifestations, both between and within families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we discuss the clinical variability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> by describing a large fourgeneration Dutch family with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>.Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nineteen individuals of one family with a single missense FBN1 mutation (c.7916A&gt;G) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The same mutation was found in one unrelated person </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical variability was extensive and not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mutation carriers fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Some patients only expressed mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>skeletal abnormalities</z:hpo>, whereas aortic root dilation was present in eight patients, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> was recorded in two other patients, and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> was present in eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In some patients cardiac features were not present on initial screening, but did however develop over time.Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> is a clinically highly variable syndrome, which means a meticulous evaluation of suspected cases is crucial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mutation carriers should be re-evaluated regularly as cardiovascular symptoms may develop over time </plain></SENT>
