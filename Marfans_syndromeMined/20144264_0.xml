<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Transforming growth factor beta receptors II gene (TGFBR2) mutations associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and Marfan-associated disorders have been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, such studies are limited in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To obtain more information about TGFBR2 mutations, we analyzed 6 unrelated Chinese patients with Marfan-associated disorders and without ocular manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The genomic DNA from blood leukocytes of these 6 patients and their relatives was isolated, and the entire coding region of TGFBR2 was amplified using PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We determined the sequence of TGFBR2 with the ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three mutations were identified in TGFBR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two mutations were associated with Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), which were distributed as following: one missense mutation R528C (caused by a 1582C &gt; T substitution) and one polymorphism T315M (a rare SNP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The third mutation was a novel silent mutation associated with MFS2, which was K291K caused by an 873 C &gt; T substitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The TGFBR2 gene missense mutations are possibly causative mutations of Loeys-Dietz syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This result suggests an increase in the mutation spectrum of Marfan-related disorders in China and possibly world-wide </plain></SENT>
