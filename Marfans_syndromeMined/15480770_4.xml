<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene lead to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most common complication of this disease is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> due to elastic deficiencies of the vascular wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several case reports describe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">glomerular disease</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and fibrillin-1 has been implicated in nephrogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To study the role of fibrillin-1 in renal development and function, we characterized the renal phenotype of fibrillin-1-underexpressing mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kidney histology was evaluated by means of morphometry and stereology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relative kidney weights, daily urine excretion, urinary albumin excretion, serum and urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, as well as serum <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> were not different than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Glomerular number and renal capillarization were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The size of the renal filtration surface was comparable in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and fibrillin-1-underexpressing mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no indication for glomerular, renal vascular, or tubulointerstitial injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, glomerular volume and mesangial area were reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No changes in glomerular cell numbers were detected, but the cellular volume of mesangial cells was significantly lower in glomeruli of fibrillin-1-underexpressing mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, despite the high abundance of fibrillin-1 in glomeruli of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> animals, underexpression of fibrillin-1 did not lead to functional deficiencies of the glomerulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Alterations in renal histology were only subtle with a reduced glomerular volume and mesangial area likely due to a reduced mesangial cell volume </plain></SENT>
