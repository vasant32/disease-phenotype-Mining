<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inherited as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> disorder, the etiology and pathogenesis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> are presently unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have documented consistent apparent deficient content of elastin-associated microfibrillar fibers by indirect immunofluorescent (IF) studies of Marfan skin, as well as deficient accumulation of related fibrous materials in cultures of Marfan fibroblasts as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heritable disorders</z:e> of connective tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data have suggested that abnormalities in the microfibrillar component of elastic-fiber systems may have a role in the etiology and pathogenesis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have analyzed the IF staining patterns of skin and fibroblast cultures from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> first-degree relatives in nine Marfan kindreds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of these families had at least one affected individual in each of 2 generations, permitting intergenerational comparison of IF patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six kindreds had one or more affected individuals in a single generation, making comparisons between siblings and/or parent-child possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, IF abnormalities cosegregated with the Marfan phenotype and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nonaffected family members were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within family groups containing more than one affected individual, the IF staining patterns were similar between affected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data provide further confirmation of consistent and relatively specific deficiency of microfibrillar fibers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
