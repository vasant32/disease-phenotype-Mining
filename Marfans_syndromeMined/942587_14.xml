<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cross-sectional echocardiographic features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> were defined in 26 children (ages 2-18 years) using a real-time, multiple-crystal ultrasound scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In each patient the physical findings of the mitral valve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026267" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PMV">click-murmur syndrome</z:e> were present and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> had been diagnosed previously by conventional single crystal echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mitral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> occurred in a familial setting in eight patients and was associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in five </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Real-time two-dimensional echocardiography uniformly disclosed maximum mitral arching and the superior-posterior <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These visual observations were confirmed by M-mode recordings derived from single elements within the array of 20 crystals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The method allowed a complete M-mode description of the phasic motion of the entire mitral apparatus and observations of the spectrum of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> from discrete late systolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> to "hammock-like" holosystolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, the recording of multiple systolic M-mode lines occurred when the ultrasound beam intersected the arched leaflets more than once </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pseudosystolic anterior motion was observed often and resulted clearly from a superimposition of echoes from the mitral annulus and from the posterior-superiorly arched prolapsed leaflets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A major finding in 22 patients was the association with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> of biconvex enlargement of the aortic sinuses of Valsalva and a significant increase in the diameter of the aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>Aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> was most marked in, but not confined to, patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and was a prominent finding in six patients with minor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151491" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">musculoskeletal abnormalities</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> in children with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> body habitus raises important questions concerning the generalized nature of an abnormality of cardiac connective tissue in patients with mitral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The cross-sectional approach significantly enhances the noninvasive evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> and provides an explanation for many of the single crystal observations reported previously </plain></SENT>
