<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most patients have a defect in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17755">cystathionine</z:chebi>-beta-synthase, the key enzyme in the conversion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> to cysteine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many abnormalities in the connective tissue of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo> resemble those seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, caused by mutations in fibrillin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These observations led to the hypothesis that the structure and function of fibrillin-1 is compromised in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis we produced recombinant human fibrillin-1 fragments spanning the central portion of the molecule (8-Cys/transforming growth factor-beta binding domain 3 to calcium binding EGF domain 22) and extensively analyzed the potential of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> to modify structural and functional properties of these proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed moderate changes of their secondary structures after incubation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Equilibrium dialysis demonstrated a number of high affinity calcium binding sites in the tandemly repeated calcium binding epidermal growth factor-like domains 11-22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Calcium binding of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>-modified fragments was completely abolished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Incubation of the recombinant proteins with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> rendered the analyzed calcium binding EGF domains as well as the 8-Cys/transforming growth factor-beta binding domain 3 significantly more susceptible to proteolytic degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, data were obtained demonstrating that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> can covalently modify fibrillin-1 via <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bonds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data strongly suggest that structural and functional modifications as well as degradation processes of fibrillin-1 in the connective tissues of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo> play a major role in the pathogenesis of this disorder </plain></SENT>
