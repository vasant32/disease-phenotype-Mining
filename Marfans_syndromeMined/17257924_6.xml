<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the mid-term results of the reimplantation valve-sparing aortic root replacement using the Gelweave Valsalva prosthesis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of 35 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in four centers who underwent the reimplantation valve-sparing aortic root replacement using the Gelweave Valsalva prosthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients were predominantly men, with a mean age of 36.5 +/- 12.6 years (range, 14 to 62 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissections and underwent emergent operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elective hemiarch reconstruction using hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> was required in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aortic valve cusp repair was performed in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no operative or hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, and no patients died during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 19 months (range, 1 to 60 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant (&gt;2+) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> (AI), requiring aortic valve replacement, developed in 3 patients during follow-up that requiring aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 5-year freedom from reoperation owing to structural valve deterioration was 88.9% +/- 8.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no episodes of clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reimplantation valve-sparing aortic root replacement with the Gelweave Valsalva prosthesis in Marfan patients provides satisfactory mid-term results, thus encouraging further use of this type of repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, long-term results are needed in order to define the durability of this technique </plain></SENT>
