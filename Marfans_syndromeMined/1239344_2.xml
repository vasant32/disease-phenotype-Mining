<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A pair of monzygotic twins with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> with variable expression is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the twins, in addition to more severe musculoskeletal and ocular manifestations, had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001680'>coarctation of the aorta</z:hpo> as the cardiovascular manifestation of this symdrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of red cell antigens, serum proteins and dermatoglyphic examination suggests a high probability of monozygosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the variation in expression of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> disorder between the twins is most likely due to the modifying influences of environmental factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also noteworthy is the fact that the resected coarctation tissue demonstrated the histopathologic changes characteristic of cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, and thus served as an additional piece of evidence supporting the diagnosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was of particular importance in view of the absence of any family history of this syndrome and the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> or the more typical cardiovascular manifestations in either twin </plain></SENT>
