<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While most of the known mutations in fibrillin-1 cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, a number of other mutations lead to clinical features unrelated to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is currently thought to be driven by mechanisms due to haploinsufficiency of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> fibrillin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, haploinsufficiency-driven mechanisms cannot explain the distinct phenotypes found in other fibrillinopathies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that mutations in fibrillin-1 cause disorders through primary effects on microfibril structure, two different mutations were generated in Fbn1 in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One mutation leads to a truncated fibrillin-1 molecule that is tagged with green fluorescent protein, allowing visualization of mutant fibrillin-1 incorporated into microfibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In heterozygosity, these mutant mice demonstrate progressive fragmentation of the aortic elastic lamellae and also display fragmentation of microfibrils in other tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin-2 epitopes are also progressively revealed in these mice, suggesting that fibrillin-2 immunoreactivity can serve as a marker for microfibril degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a second mutation (in-frame deletion of the first hybrid domain) in fibrillin-1 results in stable microfibrils, demonstrating that fibrillin-1 molecules are not required to be in perfect register for microfibril structure and function and that the first hybrid domain is dispensable for microfibril assembly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that perturbation of microfibril structure may underlie one of the major features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>: fragmentation of aortic elastic lamellae </plain></SENT>
