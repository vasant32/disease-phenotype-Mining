<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients before 1988 (Group I) underwent simple ascending aortic replacement (n = 13) and composite graft replacement (n = 5) by conventional method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients after 1989 (Group II) underwent extended ascending aortic replacement (n = 17), hemiarch replacement (n = 6), total arch replacement (n = 8) and composite graft replacement (n = 4) using a brief period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall hospital mortality rate was 36.8% in Group I and 25.7% in Group II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The survivals after initial operation was 47% at 10 years (Kaplan-Meier) and the event free rate was 78% at ten years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computed tomographic scanning and aortogram demonstrated the patent false lumen in 20 patients (64.5%) at the descending thoracic aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, extended ascending aortic replacement is the useful operative technique to perform accurate resection of intimal disruption and clamp-site aorta because the replacement of the entry site could reduce the risk of operative mortality and reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total arch replacement is not necessarily required, if the entry is properly resected by extended ascending aortic replacement or hemiarch replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Close follow-up must be considered at the patients with patent false lumen, especially in patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
