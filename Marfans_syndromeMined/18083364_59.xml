<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For the thoracic aorta, these diseases are increasingly treated by stent-grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No prospective randomized study exists comparing stent-grafting and open surgical treatment, including for disease subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Currently, one stent-graft device is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for descending thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> although two new devices are expected to obtain FDA approval in 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stent-graft devices are used "off label" or under physician Investigational Device Exemption studies for other indications such as traumatic rupture of the aorta and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early first-generation devices suffered from problems such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with insertion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004933'>ascending aortic dissection</z:hpo> or aortic penetration from struts, vascular injury, graft collapse, endovascular leaks, graft material failure, continued <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> expansion or rupture, and migration or kinking; however, the newer iterations coming to market have been considerably improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the devices have been tested in pulse duplicators out to 10 years, long-term durability is not known, particularly in young patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The long-term consequences of repeated computed tomography scans for checking device integrity and positioning on the risk of irradiation-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> remains of concern in young patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This document (1) reviews the natural history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e>, indications for repair, outcomes after conventional open surgery, currently available devices, and insights from outcomes of randomized studies using stent-grafts for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery, the latter having been treated for a longer time by stent-grafts; and (2) offers suggestions for treatment </plain></SENT>
