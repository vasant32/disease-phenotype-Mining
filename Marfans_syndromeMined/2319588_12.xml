<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data are also presented for a further two unmapped markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most likely location of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> gene is highlighted and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the unexcluded areas of the genome are displayed in a graphical form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This exclusion map shows that almost 75% of the genome has been excluded as a likely location for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> gene in the majority of the families studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Apart from chromosomes 8, 13, 21, and 22, for which no data were available, other regions not excluded yet include 5p, 6p, 9p, 10p, 12p, 15, 17p, 18, and 20p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Future linkage analysis using markers located in the highlighted regions should facilitate the identification of the site of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> gene </plain></SENT>
