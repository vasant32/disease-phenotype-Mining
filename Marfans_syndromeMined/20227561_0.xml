<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e> (EDS) comprises a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of diseases involving genetic collagen fibre impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a case of a patient presenting the rare type VIII, in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>dermatitis</z:hpo> ocre was associated with parodontal disease, and which was diagnosed late </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 29-year-old man consulted for a pretibial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> present for seven years, resulting from a post-traumatic haematoma that had failed to heal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In view of the longiliner <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, it had previously been diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, edentation was observed as well as "alveolar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002659'>bone fragility</z:hpo>" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Examination revealed a marfanoid morphotype, a pretibial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> set within long-standing bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>dermatitis</z:hpo> ocre and papyraceous scars, but no joint hyperlaxity or cutaneous hyperelasticity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was consequently corrected to EDS type VIII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Type VIII is a rare form of EDS, and the molecular mechanism is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The involvement of parodontal connective tissue suggests impairment of collagen I and III proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is important to identify this type of the disease since it involves parodontal disease for which early treatment is required in order to try to prevent edentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present case demonstrates the importance of diagnosis, which may be based upon appearance of bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>dermatitis</z:hpo> ocre from the age of 15 years associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001030'>skin fragility</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This sign is not part of the classical picture of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, with which EDS type VIII is often confounded </plain></SENT>
