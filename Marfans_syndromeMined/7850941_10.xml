<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A comprehensive evaluation of arterial load characteristics and left ventricular energetics in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo> has been limited by the need for invasive techniques to access instantaneous aortic pressure and flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a consequence of this methodological limitation, no data exist on the effects of long-term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> therapy on global arterial impedance properties and indexes of myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using recently validated noninvasive techniques, we compared in hypertensive patients the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> oral treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8774">ramipril</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi>, and atenolol on arterial impedance and mechanical power dissipation as well as indexes of MVO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixteen African-American subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo> were studied with a randomized, double-blind, crossover protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Instantaneous central aortic pressure and flow, from which arterial load characteristics can be derived, were estimated from calibrated subclavian pulse tracings (SPTs) and continuous-wave aortic Doppler velocity in conjunction with two-dimensional (2D) echocardiographic measurements of the aortic annulus, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To derive ventricular wall stress and indexes of MVO2, left ventricular short- (M-mode) and long-axis (2D echo) images were acquired simultaneously with SPTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were collected at the end of a 2-week washout period (predrug control) and after 6 weeks of treatment with each agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three agents <z:mp ids='MP_0006263'>reduced diastolic blood pressure</z:mp> to the same extent, different effects on mean and systolic pressures and vascular impedance properties were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">Nifedipine</z:chebi> reduced total peripheral resistance (TPR; 1744 +/- 398 versus 1290 +/- 215 dyne-s/cm5) and increased arterial compliance (ACL; 1.234 +/- 0.253 versus 1.776 +/- 0.415 mL/mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This improvement in arterial compliance was not entirely accounted for by the reduction in distending pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8774">Ramipril</z:chebi> also decreased TPR (1740 +/- 292 versus 1437 +/- 290 dyne-s/cm5) and increased ACL (1.214 +/- 0.190 versus 1.569 +/- 0.424 mL/mm Hg), but with this agent, the change in arterial compliance was explained solely on the basis of a reduction in distending pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Atenolol, in contrast, did not affect either TPR or ACL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In agreement with the compliance results, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8774">ramipril</z:chebi> significantly lowered the first two harmonics of the impedance spectrum, but atenolol did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>None of these agents resulted in a significant change in characteristic impedance or in the relative amplitude of the reflected pressure wave </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Total vascular mechanical power and percent of oscillatory power remained unaltered with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8774">ramipril</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> reduced the integral of both meridional and circumferential systolic wall stresses, indicating that MVO2 per beat was reduced with these agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Stress-time index, a measure of MVO2 per unit time, decreased significantly with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8774">ramipril</z:chebi> but not with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> because of an increase in heart rate noted in 10 of 16 patients (mean increase, 10 beats per minute) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Thus, a reduction in MVO2 coupled with unchanged total vascular mechanical power suggests improved efficiency of ventriculoarterial coupling with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8774">ramipril</z:chebi> and with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> in the subset of patients in whom heart rate remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there was no evidence of a reduction in wall stress, stress integral, or stress-time index with atenolol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The noninvasive methodology used in this study constitutes a new tool for serial and simultaneous evaluation of arterial hemodynamics and left ventricular energetics in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrate the differential effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> therapies on systemic arterial circulation and indexes of MVO2 in African-American subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Consideration of drug-induced differential responses of arterial load and indexes of MVO2 with each drug may provide a more physiological approach to the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo> in indivi </plain></SENT>
