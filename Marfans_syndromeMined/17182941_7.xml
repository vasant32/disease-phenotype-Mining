<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More recently, TAAD has also been demonstrated to occur as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> disorder in the absence of syndromic features, termed familial TAAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Familial TAAD demonstrates <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo>, and linkage studies have identified TAAD loci at 5q13-14 (TAAD1), 11q23 (FAA1), 3p24-25 (TAAD2), and 16p12.2-13.13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> of TAAD is reflected by variation in disease in terms of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, progression, penetrance, and association with additional cardiac and vascular features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> of TAAD is reflected in the phenotypic variation associated with familial TAAD with respect to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, progression, penetrance, and association with additional cardiac and vascular features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the TGFBR2 gene have been identified as the cause of disease linked to the 3p24-25 locus, implicating dysregulation of TGF-beta signaling in TAAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutations in myosin heavy chain (MYH11), a smooth muscle cell-specific contractile protein, have been identified in familial TAAD associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001643'>patent ductus arteriosus</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp>) linked to 16p12.2-12.13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The identification of these novel disease pathways has led to new directions for future research addressing the pathology and treatment of TAAD </plain></SENT>
