<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Few series have examined follow-up risks of the David reimplantation operation in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hence, we assessed its midterm safety and effectiveness for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e>, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos</z:e>, Loeys-Dietz, and marfanoid syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 313 patients who underwent modified David reimplantation, 178 identified as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> underwent operation from January 1, 1991, to December 31, 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These disorders included Marfan (84%), marfanoid (8.4%), Loeys-Dietz (5.6%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos</z:e> (1.1%), and other syndromes (1.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concomitant procedures included mitral valve repair in 7.3% and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> procedure in 3.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no operative or 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complications included prolonged ventilation (3%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> (3%), reoperation for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (2.2%), and permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (0.56%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight-year survival was 94% and freedom from aortic valve reoperation at 6 years was 92% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 7 aortic valve reoperations, 3 were attributable to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> and 3 to technical failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One reoperation was performed at another hospital, and the reason could not be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> or hemorrhagic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At 4 years, approximately 70% of patients had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic valve regurgitation</z:hpo>, and 18% were in grade 1+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic root and valve preservation using David reimplantation is safe and provides excellent midterm effectiveness and low risk of late events except for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
