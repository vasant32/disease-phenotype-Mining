<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Our purpose was to evaluate intraindividually the performance of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and non-contrast MRA for aortic root diameter measurements and to compare the results with routinely performed echocardiography in patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: Aortic roots were examined prospectively in 51 consecutive patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> by using contrast-enhanced MRA and non-contrast MRA at 1.5T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two readers independently measured aortic root diameters at the annulus, sinuses of Valsalva and sinutubular junction in both data sets and compared results with echocardiographic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intraclass correlation coefficient, Pearson correlation coefficient, Bland-Altman, and two-sided t-test were used to assess agreement between observers and methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 38 (74.5%) of the 51 patients (25 female, 26 male; mean age 37.1Â±13.7years) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both, contrast-enhanced MRA and non-contrast MRA measurements of the sinuses of Valsalva revealed a strong correlation with echocardiography (r=0.850 and r=0.893, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intraclass correlation was markedly better for non-enhanced MRA (r=0.904) when compared to contrast-enhanced MRA (r=0.690) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Image quality (p&lt;0.001) as well as interobserver agreement (p&lt;0.0042) of measurements of the sinuses of Valsalva was significantly better for non-enhanced MRA than for contrast-enhanced MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Non-contrast MRA was more reliable and more valid than contrast-enhanced MRA for assessment of aortic root dimensions in patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore contrast agents can be omitted for establishing the diagnosis of aortic involvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
