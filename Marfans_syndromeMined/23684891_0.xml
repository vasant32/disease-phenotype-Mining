<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to investigate the role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> in raising the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and its association with FBN1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied 40 unrelated patients suspected for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, who underwent magnetic resonance imaging searching for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients resulted positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> was grade 1 in 19 patients, grade 2 in 11 patients, and grade 3 in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 7 (24%) patients, the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> allowed to reach a positive score for systemic feature criterion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty four patients carried a FBN1 mutation, that were represented by 13 missense (54%), and 11 (46%) mutations generating a premature termination codon (PTC, frameshifts and stop codons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No mutation was detected in the remaining 16 (6 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and 10 with related disorders according to revised Ghent criteria) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of severe (grade 2 and grade 3) involvement of dura mater was higher in patients harbouring premature termination codon (PTC) mutations than those carrying missense-mutations (8/11 vs 2/13, P=0.0111) </plain></SENT>
