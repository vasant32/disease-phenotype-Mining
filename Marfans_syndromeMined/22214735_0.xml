<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included in this prospective study <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients examined in our preventive cardiology outpatient clinics during the biannual period October 2004-October 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined in total 10.818 patients, 238 of whom (2.2%) were diagnosed for MVP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We noted relevant demographic and clinical data (gender, age of diagnosis, symptoms, need for hospitalization) and performed statistical comparisons between patients with the classic and those with the non-classic form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up controls were performed three years afterwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with the classic form had an earlier age of first diagnosis, more prominent symptoms, and more frequently diagnosis for other disorders (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e>) than the rest of the patients; however, there were no significant differences as far as certain major complications (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, submission to surgery) were concerned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The classic form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> is more tightly associated with morbid complications, and a more frequent follow-up control in this group of patients may be useful </plain></SENT>
