<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Height and weight percentiles were established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardiac dimensions and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> were studied by M-mode and 2D-echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis left atrial and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and left ventricular posterior wall thickness were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits except in a few adolescent patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interventricular septum was thickened in about 20% and aortic diameter increased in 56% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An additional 13% of patients developed <z:mp ids='MP_0010574'>aortic dilation</z:mp> during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis regression analysis revealed a significant (P less than 0.05) correlation of the aortic diameter, septal thickness and the posterior left ventricular wall thickness and body surface area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow up studies of 19 patients allowed documentation of the development of aortic root dilation </plain></SENT>
