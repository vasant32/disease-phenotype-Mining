<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Extracts from Marfan fibroblasts demonstrate 3 to 10 times more total and specific <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16336">hyaluronic acid</z:chebi> synthetase activity than do preparations from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> synthetic activity was found in particulate fractions with the bulk of activity localized in material sedimenting as large membrane fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Marfan and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> preparations exhibited similar properties with respect to substrate, cofactor, pH requirements, and heat stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither the Marfan nor <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> enzyme systems could be stimulated by exogenous acceptors, nor did either preparation contain a soluble factor which stimulated or inhibited the enzymic activity of the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The genetic defect in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> appears to result in increased activity of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16336">hyaluronic acid</z:chebi> synthetase without demonstrable changes in properties of the particulate enzymes involved </plain></SENT>
