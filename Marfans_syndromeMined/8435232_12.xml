<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We offer elective aortic replacement ot those we regard as being at high risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aortic root dimension and its rate of increase are the best predictors we have </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We regard 5.5 cm as the probable upper limit and we are inclined to advocate surgery at an earlier stage in high risk families and in women planning pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These operations are planned for a calculated gain in life expectancy and it would be reasonable for there to be a degree of centralisation of referral and development of surgical expertise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We use beta-blockade for life, both before and after surgery, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> with aortic root enlargement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data on which these recommendations are based are incomplete and we can only hope that with an increasing number of carefully documented cases we will refine them and improve upon them in the future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The concept of a "forme fruste" or a "Marfanoid aorta" in the absence of the syndrome is highly questionable so the comments made apply only to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>--not to other forms of annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> or other less well characterised forms of aortic root disease </plain></SENT>
