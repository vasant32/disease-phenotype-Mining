<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the fibrillin gene on chromosome 15 (FBN1) were described at first in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heritable connective tissue disorder</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More recently, FBN1 has also been shown to harbor mutations related to a spectrum of conditions phenotypically related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and many mutations will have to be accumulated before genotype/phenotype relationships emerge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To facilitate mutational analysis of the FBN1 gene, a software package along with a computerized database (currently <z:mp ids='MP_0008913'>listing</z:mp> 63 entries) have been created </plain></SENT>
