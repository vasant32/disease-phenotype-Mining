<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present brief review is to show that the pulsatile component of blood pressure is a stronger determinant of large artery remodelling than the steady component (i.e. mean blood pressure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pulse pressure, which is a strong determinant of cardiovascular events, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, is increased when large arteries stiffen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Local pulse pressure, measured with applanation tonometry in normotensives and patients with essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, explains a significant part of the variance of intima-media thickness at the site of the carotid artery, a proximal elastic artery, whereas mean blood pressure does not contribute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Local pulse pressure has no influence on intima-media thickness at the site of the radial artery, a distal muscular artery that undergoes very little <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> change in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The decrease in carotid pulse pressure is also a major determinant of the regression of carotid intima-media thickness after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Local pulse pressure can influence not only intima-media thickness, but also internal diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Indeed, there is a significant association between the lumen enlargement of the ascending aorta in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and pulse pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, carotid pulse pressure is positively correlated with carotid internal diameter in normotensives and hypertensives, and the decrease in carotid internal diameter during long-term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment is influenced by the decrease in carotid pulse pressure and not by the reduction in mean blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the effects of pulse pressure on large artery remodelling may explain part of its predictive value on cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
