<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the chiropractic management of a patient with whiplash-associated disorder and a covert, concomitant dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the thoracic aorta caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> or a related variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL FEATURES: A 25-year-old man was referred by his family physician for chiropractic assessment and treatment of neck injuries received in a motor vehicle accident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After history, physical examination, and plain film radiographic investigation, a diagnosis of whiplash-associated disorder grade I was generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: The whiplash-associated disorder grade I was treated conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic management involved soft-tissue therapy to the suspensory and paraspinal musculature of the upper back and neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rotary, manual-style manipulative therapy of the cervical and compressive manipulative therapy of the thoracic spinal column were implemented to maintain range of motion and decrease pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient achieved full recovery within a 3-week treatment period and was discharged from care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One week after discharge, he underwent a routine evaluation by his family physician, where an aortic murmur was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic ultrasound revealed a dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> measuring 78 mm at the aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immediate surgical correction was initiated with a <z:chebi fb="12" ids="53259">polyethylene terephthalate</z:chebi> fiber graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The pathologic report indicated that aortic features were consistent with an old (healed) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Six month follow-up revealed that surgical repair was successful in arresting further <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The patient had an old <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> that pre-dated the chiropractic treatment (which included manipulative therapy) for the whiplash-associated disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Manipulative therapy, long considered an absolute contraindication for abdominal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo>, did not provoke the progression of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> or other negative sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The cause, histology, clinical features, and management considerations in the treatment of this patient's condition(s) are discussed </plain></SENT>
