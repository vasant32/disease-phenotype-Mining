<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated changes of the descending aortic false lumen during the midterm postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Postoperative computed tomographic (CT) images of 122 patients who underwent conventional ascending with or without arch replacement for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type I dissection were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patency and width of false lumen and maximal diameter of the aorta were compared between early and last follow-up images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes were analyzed separately in the thoracic and abdominal segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In early CT, thoracic false lumen was patent in 85 patients (69.7%), and abdominal false lumen was patent in 111 patients (91.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among these, the false lumen remained patent after a mean interval of 33.6 months in 69 patients (81.1%) and 105 patients (94.6%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 58 patients (47.5%), the descending aorta dilated by 1 cm or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>Dilatation</z:mpath> occurred more frequently in the thoracic aorta and in patients with patent or wide false lumens, larger aortic diameter, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, younger age, and male sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, shrinkage of thoracic false lumen occurred in 36 patients (29.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Such shrinkage occurred in 23 of 24 patients (95.8%) who had thrombosed and narrow false lumens in the thoracic aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early postoperative characteristics of false lumen were helpful for predicting both dilation and regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our data show not only a high incidence of descending <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> after repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type I dissection, but also shrinkage of thoracic false lumen in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings can be used as control data for determining the benefit of more extensive or new surgical approaches </plain></SENT>
