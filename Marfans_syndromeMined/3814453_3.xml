<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0010316'>Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve</z:hpo> is characterised by downstream displacement of the tricuspid leaflets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the case of the septal leaflet, the result is exaggerated offsetting of the atrioventricular valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus it might be supposed that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0010316'>Ebstein's anomaly</z:hpo> of the mitral valve, downstream displacement of the aortic (septal) leaflet of the mitral valve could move its attachment beyond that of the tricuspid valve, resulting in reversed offsetting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To examine this hypothesis three patients each with a concordant atrioventricular connection were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and without an abnormal mitral valve, had reversed offsetting shown by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second, without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010316'>Ebstein's anomaly</z:hpo> of the mitral valve, showed echocardiographically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> offsetting but a displaced mural leaflet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The third, in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0010316'>Ebstein's anomaly</z:hpo> of the mitral valve was confirmed at necropsy, showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the features of the second case, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> offsetting of the atrioventricular valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus reversed offsetting is not a feature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010316'>Ebstein's anomaly</z:hpo> of the mitral valve and in the first case this feature was caused by upward displacement of the tricuspid valve secondary to dilation of the aortic root </plain></SENT>
