<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A best evidence topic was written according to a structured protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The question addressed was whether the reimplantation (David) technique or the remodeling (Yacoub) technique provides the optimum event free survival in patients with an aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> suitable for an aortic valve-sparing operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, 392 papers were found using the reported search criteria, of which 14 papers provided the best evidence to answer the clinical question </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 1338 patients (Yacoub technique in 606 and David technique in 732) from 13 centres were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In most series, cardiopulmonary bypass time and aortic cross-clamp time were longer for the David technique compared to the Yacoub technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early mortality was comparable between the two techniques (0-6.9% for the Yacoub technique and 0-6% for the David technique) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There is a tendency for a higher freedom from significant long-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> in the David group than the Yacoub group, which does not necessarily result in a higher reoperation rate in the Yacoub group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the largest series reported, freedom from a moderate-to-severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> at 12 years was 82.6 ± 6.2% in the Yacoub and 91.0 ± 3.8% in the David group (P=0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Freedom from reoperation at the same time point was 90.4 ± 4.7% in the Yacoub group and 97.4 ± 2.2% in the David group (P=0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In another series, freedom from reoperation at a follow-up time of about four years was 89 ± 4% in the Yacoub group and 98 ± 2% in the David group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although some authors merely preferred the Yacoub technique for a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo>, the accumulated evidence in the current review indicates comparable results for both techniques in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Current evidence is in favour of the David rather than the Yacoub technique in pathologies such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, and excessive annular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> that may impair aortic root integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Careful selection of patients for each technique and successful restoration of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cusp geometry are the keys to success in aortic valve-sparing operations </plain></SENT>
