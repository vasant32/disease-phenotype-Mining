<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As Ca(2+) waves are tightly associated with vasoconstriction, we hypothesized decreased tonic contraction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is due to aberrant Ca(2+) wave signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Isometric force and intracellular Ca(2+) were measured from second-order mesenteric arteries from mice heterozygous for the Fbn1 allele encoding a cysteine substitution (Fbn1(C1039G/+)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">Phenylephrine</z:chebi> concentration-dependently induced tonic contraction associated with sustained repetitive oscillations in intracellular [Ca(2+)] in both control and Marfan vessels, although Marfan vessels displayed significantly decreased Ca(2+) wave frequency and decreased number of cells exhibiting waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) re-uptake by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22450,38615">cyclopiazonic acid</z:chebi> abolished Ca(2+) waves, dramatically decreasing tonic contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">Nifedipine</z:chebi> significantly reduced Ca(2+) wave frequency and tonic contraction, while the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi>-insensitive component was abolished by SKF-96365 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ca(2+) waves and tonic contraction were abolished by 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate, but were unaffected by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> or tetracaine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">Phenylephrine</z:chebi>-induced Ca(2+) waves underlie tonic contraction in resistance-sized mesenteric arteries and appear to be produced by repetitive cycles of regenerative Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum </plain></SENT>
