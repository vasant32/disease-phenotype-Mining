<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between August 1975 and July 2002, 162 consecutive patients underwent a Bentall procedure for CVGR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic, treatment and clinical outcome data from these patients were gathered, reviewed, and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Potential predictors of early and late mortality were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study population was predominantly male (n = 132; 81.5%) and middle-aged (mean age 51.3 +/- 15.8 years; range: 10-79 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main indications for surgery were annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> (n = 75; 46.3%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (n = 44; 27.2%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (n = 34; 21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reoperation was required in 37 cases (22.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean follow up was 74 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early (in-hospital) mortality was 1.9% (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The only independent determinant of early mortality was cardiopulmonary bypass time (p = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Late mortality was 27.7% (n = 44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, the only independent risk factors for late mortality were age &gt;60 years (p = 0.044) and left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;50% (p = 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival rates were 92.9%, 77%, 56.2%, and 47.1% at one, five, 10, and 15 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Rates of freedom from reoperation on the aortic root and ascending aorta were 90.6% and 72.5% at five and 15 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were observed at any coronary reimplantation sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this series, the Bentall procedure was associated with low operative mortality and good early and late results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the procedure may be considered as a reference to other operations on the aortic root, at least in adult patients </plain></SENT>
