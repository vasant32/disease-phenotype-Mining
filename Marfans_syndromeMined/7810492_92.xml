<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Data reported in 1972 indicated that lifespan in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is markedly shortened, and that most <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> are cardiovascular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to determine whether survival in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> has changed since 1972, and to discern whether treatment (medical or surgical) has altered prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Survival curves were generated on 417 patients from 4 referral centers, with a definite diagnosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Birth date, age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, cardiovascular surgery, or treatment with beta blockers, or any combination of these, were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven of 417 patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (41 +/- 18 years) was significantly increased compared with age in 1972 (32 +/- 16 years, p = 0.0023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median (50%) cumulative probability of survival in 1993 was 72 years compared with 48 years in 1972 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 112 surgically treated patients, 10-year probability of survival was 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing surgery after 1980 enjoyed significantly increased survival than patients who had undergone operation before 1980 (p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, life expectancy for patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> has increased &gt; 25% since 1972 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reasons for this dramatic increase may include (1) an overall improvement in population life expectancy, (2) benefits arising from cardiovascular surgery, and (3) greater proportion of milder cases due to increased frequency of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Medical therapy (including beta blockers) was also associated with an increase in probable survival </plain></SENT>
