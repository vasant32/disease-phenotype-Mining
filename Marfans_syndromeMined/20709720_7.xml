<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates the cardiovascular (CV) risk associated with the discovery of a fibrillin-1 (FBN1) mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1,013 probands with pathogenic FBN1 mutations were included, among whom 965 patients [median age: 22 years (11-34), male gender 53%] had data suitable for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percentage of patients with an ascending aortic (AA) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> increased steadily with increasing age and reached 96% (95% CI: 94-97%) by 60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of aortic events (dissection or prophylactic surgery) was rare before 20 years and then increased progressively, reaching 74% (95% CI: 67-81%) by 60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with women, men were at higher risk for AA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> [≤ 30 years: 57% (95% CI: 52-63) vs. 50% (95% CI: 45-55), P = 0.0076] and aortic events [≤ 30 years: 21% (95% CI: 17-26) vs. 11% (95% CI: 8-16), P &lt; 0.0001; adjusted HR: 1.4 (1.1-1.8), P = 0.005] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of mitral valve (MV) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> [≤ 60 years: 77% (95% CI: 72-82)] and MV regurgitation [≤ 60 years: 61% (95% CI: 53-69)] also increased steadily with age, but surgery limited to the MV remained rare [≤ 60 years: 13% (95% CI: 8-21)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No difference between genders was observed (for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&gt; 0.20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From 1985 to 2005 the prevalence of AA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> remained stable (P for trend = 0.88), whereas the percentage of patients with AA dissection significantly decreased (P for trend = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The CV risk remains important in patients with an FBN1 gene mutation and is present throughout life, justifying regular aortic monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>Aortic dilatation</z:hpo> or dissection should always trigger suspicion of a genetic background leading to thorough examination for extra-aortic features and comprehensive pedigree investigation </plain></SENT>
