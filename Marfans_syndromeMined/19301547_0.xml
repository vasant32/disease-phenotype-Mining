<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The records of 84 consecutive patients (66 men, 18 women; mean age 46.6 years) who had undergone aortic valve-sparing root replacement using the reimplantation technique between January 1997 and July 2006, were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the patients, 26 (31%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and 14 (17%) had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean follow up period was 4.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were three early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (4%) and five late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Late survival (&gt;30 days) at five and eight years was 95% and 88%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (p = 0.001), a lower preoperative ejection fraction (p = 0.03) and older age (p = 0.04) were the only univariate predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Freedom from moderate-severe or severe (grade 3 or 4) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic valve regurgitation</z:hpo> at one and five years was 91% and 77%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (12%) required aortic valve reoperation at a mean of 3.4 years after surgery (3/14 bicuspid, 7/70 tricuspid); however, only one reoperation was required among patients undergoing the initial surgery after the year 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Freedom from aortic valve reoperation at one and five years was 95% and 83%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The predischarge degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic valve regurgitation</z:hpo> was the sole univariate factor associated with aortic valve reoperation (p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Bicuspid valve <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> was not a predictor of either recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic valve regurgitation</z:hpo>, nor of aortic valve reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>Bicuspid aortic valves</z:hpo> may be safely spared by reimplantation during replacement of the aortic root, with similar mid-term durability as for tricuspid aortic valves </plain></SENT>
