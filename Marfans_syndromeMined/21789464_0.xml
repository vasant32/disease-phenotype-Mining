<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although mutations in the FBN1 gene have been recognized as the cause of the disease, more recently other loci have been associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, indicating the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We addressed the issue of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> by performing linkage analysis of the FBN1 and TGFBR2 genes in 34 families (345 subjects) who met the clinical diagnostic criteria for the disease according to Ghent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a total of six microsatellite markers, we found that linkage with the FBN1 gene was observed or not excluded in 70.6% (24/34) of the families, and in 1 family the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> phenotype segregated with the TGFBR2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in 4 families linkage with the FBN1 and TGFBR2 genes was excluded, and no mutations were identified in the coding region of TGFBR1, indicating the existence of other genes involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> may be greater that previously reported </plain></SENT>
