<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: In 91 children (42 boys, 49 girls, age range 3.2 to 18.4 years) undergoing Marfan screening from 1983 until 1996, the diagnosis <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and any other aortic pathology was definitely ruled out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These served as a control population to set appropriate reference standards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with a standard Dutch reference population, body surface area of the control subjects (mean (SD)) was above the 50th centile (boys 0.09 (0.20) m2, range -0.28 to 0.69 m2; girls 0.09 (0.17) m2, range -0.17 to 0.69 m2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographically determined aortic root diameter and body surface area showed a linear relation and a greater variability of aortic root diameter in these relatively tall subjects (n = 91, R2 = 0.62) than in the standard nomogram (n = 56, R2 = 0.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 24% of cases (n = 22), the aortic root exceeded the upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the standard nomogram, by 2.2 (2.0) mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An adjusted nomogram was constructed with a higher upper limit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A Marfan screening population differs from the unselected population in body surface area and aortic root size variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An adjusted nomogram should therefore be used to detect a truly enlarged aortic root </plain></SENT>
