<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In our experience from September 1976 through December 1999, eight consecutive patients (seven men and 1 woman) underwent eight redo composite valve graft replacements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean age at reoperation was 43.1 years (range 31 to 51 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had stigmata of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reoperation was indicated for pseudoaneurysm formation in five patients, coronary ostial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in two patients, and active fungal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Previous root replacement had been performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight patients using a composite mechanical valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The techniques used at previous procedures were the Bentall technique in seven and Carrel's button technique in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean interval between primary root replacement and redo root replacement was 10 years (range 2 to 18 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient with active fungal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> having a stuck valve was subjected to emergency operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The techniques used at the reoperations included Carrel's button technique in five patients, the interposition technique (Phieler) in two patients, and Cabrol's technique in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Aortic arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> repair was performed in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were two hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (2 [25%] of 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient died on postoperative day 1 with low cardiac output and the other suffered a sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> on postoperative day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 34.6 months (range 1 to 85 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was one late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was multiple organ failure due to recurrence of fungal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> 6 months after redo composite and total arch replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Redo composite graft replacement can be accomplished with lower early mortality, and therefore, this operation should not be delayed given the appropriate clinical circumstances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Many causes of failure of composite valve graft replacement can be avoided if the appropriate surgical technique is chosen </plain></SENT>
