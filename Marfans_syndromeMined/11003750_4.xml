<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Most patients with annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> are young </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are at risk for complications related to a lifetime of anticoagulation when composite grafts containing mechanical valves are used for reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients have near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> valve cusps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Valve-preserving techniques have been developed to maintain valve function and avoid anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The eddy currents occurring within the sinuses of Valsalva in the natural aortic root have been shown to be important in the smooth, gradual, and gentle closure of the valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compliance of the sinuses is important in reducing stress in the leaflets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A novel ascending aortic prosthesis with "built in" compliant sinuses (Robicsek-Thubrikar graft) was developed for clinical aortic root replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Woven Dacron tubes were used to make the prostheses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three precisely measured square pieces were cut to make the expandable, individual sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sewing the individual neo-sinuses to a scalloped end of the Dacron tube graft created the neo-sinotubular junction and sinotubular ridge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five patients with annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> underwent valve-preserving aortic root reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> intraoperative transesophageal echocardiographic images after the valve-preserving procedure showed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearing root with 10% radial expansion of each sinus in systole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The space between the cusps and neo-sinus wall in systole was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No patient has more than mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Valve-preserving aortic root reconstruction with a novel Dacron prosthesis with compliant "built in" sinuses re-establishes <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aortic root geometry with near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> valve motion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This may enhance the durability of the valve-preserving operation </plain></SENT>
