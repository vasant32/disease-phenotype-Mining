<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene have been identified in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to identify the molecular defects in the fibrillin-1 gene in a Chinese family with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo>/dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two patients and one non-carrier in the family underwent complete physical, ophthalmic, and cardiovascular examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes of venous blood of these individuals in the family as well as 50 healthy <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 65 coding exons of fibrillin-1 gene were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found a novel mutation (c.8547T &gt; G, p.Tyr2849X) in exon 65 of fibrillin-1 gene in a Chinese proband with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo>/dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>Sudden death</z:hpo> at a young age of affected members was seen due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo>/dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By evaluating genotype-phenotype correlations of patients with mutations in the 3' end of fibrillin-1 gene (exons 64 and 65), we also found that the presence of nonsense mutations occurring in exons 64 and 65 appeared to be an indicator of early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> aortic risk and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results expand the mutation spectrum of fibrillin-1 gene and help in the study of the molecular pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, indicating that mutations occurring in the 3' end of fibrillin-1 gene may play an independent functional role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
