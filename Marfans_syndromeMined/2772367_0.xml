<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them presented cardiovascular lesions localized mainly in the aortic and mitral valves and in the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had a dilated aortic ring in both transversal and longitudinal diameters 2.03 and 2.29 cm/m2 of body surface (bs), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The average value of the aortic valvular area was 4.71 cm2/m2 bs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 9 patients presented also <z:hpo ids='HP_0005111'>dilatation of the ascending aorta</z:hpo> (2.01 cm/cm2 bs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was thickening of the mitral valve in 5 cases and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> was present in 8 (73%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 4 cases the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> was localized in anterior leaflet valve in 2 in the posterior and in 2 in both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The maximal mitral valve diastolic area was 3.25 cm2/m2 bs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of them has needed during follow up valvular replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Considering the importance of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and knowing its unpredictable evolution we recommend, in the absence of valvular insufficiency, and annual echocardiographic reevaluation, and more often if valvular insufficiency is already present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion: two-dimensional echocardiographic is useful and necessary for the diagnosis and follow up of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
