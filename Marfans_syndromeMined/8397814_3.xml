<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent biochemical and genetic studies have demonstrated that this deadly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorder</z:e> arises from defects in the connective tissue protein fibrillin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin is a component of microfibrils, structures found in the extracellular matrices of most tissues, including those affected in Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The appearance of microfibrils in the matrix produced by Marfan patient fibroblasts is different from that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genetic linkage between the fibrillin gene and the Marfan phenotype has been established and the gene mapped to the same chromosomal position as the disease locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In several instances, the disease has been associated with mutations in the fibrillin gene, confirming that defects in fibrillin cause the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
