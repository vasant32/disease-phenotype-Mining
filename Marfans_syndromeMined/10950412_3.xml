<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors identified and retrospectively reviewed the charts of one cohort of 12 patients (15 eyes) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and RD who were operated on at the Wilmer Institute and a second cohort of 16 such patients (24 eyes) who were operated several years earlier and elsewhere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: First cohort--Final visual acuity (VA) was 20/80 or better and the retina was flat in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five phakic eyes (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The RD occurred after the eye had undergone lens removal in 10 eyes, 6 of which (60%) had a final VA of 20/80 or better, and 9 of which (90%) had a final VA of 5/200 or better (P = 0.20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Second cohort--The final VA was 20/80 or better and the retina was flat in 6 of the 7 phakic eyes (86%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 17 aphakic or pseudophakic eyes, only 5 (29%) had a flat retina and VA of 20/80 or better, whereas 12 (71%) had no light perception (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of RD operations done in the past in Marfan patients were worse when the eye was aphakic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In most cases operated more recently, the prognosis for successful RD repair was good regardless of whether the eye was phakic </plain></SENT>
