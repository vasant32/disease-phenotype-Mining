<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Still, few contemporary studies document late outcomes after <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> for CD, which is the goal of this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From August 1987 to December 2005, 480 patients underwent <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi>; 73 (15%) CD and 407 (85%) degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Operative management consisted of a clamp-and-sew technique with adjuncts in 53 (78%) CD and 355 (93%) <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> patients (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Epidural cooling was used to prevent spinal cord injury (SCI) in 51 (70%) CD and 214 (53%) <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> patients (P = .007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Study end points included perioperative SCI/mortality, freedom from reintervention, and long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CD patients were younger (mean age 64.5 years CD vs 72.5 years <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>, P &lt; .001) and more frequently had a family history of aneurysmal disease (23% CD vs 6% <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-three (59%) CD patients had elective <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> (vs 322 (79%) <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>, P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eleven (15%) CD patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (vs 0% <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>, P &lt; .001), and 17 (23%) CD patients had a prior arch or ascending aortic repair (vs 16 [4%] <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CD patients were more likely to have Crawford type I &amp; II thoracoabdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (44 [60%] vs 120 [29%] <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>, P &lt; .001), while only two (3%) CD patients had type IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (vs 99 [24%] <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in perioperative mortality between the two groups (11% CD vs 8.6% <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>, P = .52), nor was there a difference in flaccid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo>, which occurred in five (7%) CD and 22 (5%) <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> patients (P = .92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At 5 years, 70% of CD patients were free from reintervention versus 74% of <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> (P = .36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival was 53% and 32% at 5 and 10 years for CD versus 47% and 17% for <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> (P = .07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite increased operative complexity, CD does not appear to increase perioperative SCI or mortality after <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> when compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Long-term freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>-related reintervention is similar for both groups as is survival, despite patients with CD being of younger age at presentation </plain></SENT>
