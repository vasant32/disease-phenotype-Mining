<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To describe a novel mutation in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene in a large Pakistani family with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood samples were collected of 11 family members affected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and DNA was isolated by <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi>-extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The coding exons of FBN1 were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred-thirty controls were screened for a mutation in the FBN1 gene that was identified in this family by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A novel heterozygous missense mutation c.2368T&gt;A; p.Cys790Ser was observed in exon 19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This mutation substitutes a highly conserved <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32460">cysteine residue</z:chebi> by serine in a calcium binding epidermal growth factor-like domain (cbEGF) of FBN1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This mutation was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected members and absent from unaffected individuals of the family in addition to 130 healthy Pakistani controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected family members presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo>, but lacked the cardinal cardiovascular features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is a first report of a mutation in FBN1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients of Pakistani origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The identification of a FBN1 mutation in this family confirms the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients and expands the worldwide spectrum of FBN1 mutations </plain></SENT>
