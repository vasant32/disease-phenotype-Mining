<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This revolutionary king introduced a new concept in Egyptian religion and arts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is still unexplained if images of him and his family were just an artistic outbreak from old Egyptian canon or an excellent paleopathological study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several pathologic conditions were proposed to explain his appearance but neither is completely acceptable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We propose a different disease that he could have suffered of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo>--lack of cysthationine-synthase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our conclusion is that in comparison with up to date most convincing theory, that he was suffering of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, our theory equally well explains his physical appearance but is better in explaining affecting and unaffecting of his relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is the only theory about Akhenaten's disease that could be checked in the near future </plain></SENT>
