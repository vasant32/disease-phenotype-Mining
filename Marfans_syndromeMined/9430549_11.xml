<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To gain a better understanding of the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, studies were performed to determine the distribution and structure of fibrillin microfibrils in the lens capsule of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and of subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Frozen sections and/or flat mounts of lens capsules were prepared from six autopsy eyes, nine surgical capsulotomy specimens obtained at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> extraction, and five capsules from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> obtained at intracapsular lens extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Avidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-peroxidase complex (ABC) immunoperoxidase or immunofluorescence staining with monoclonal antifibrillin antibody was used to localize fibrillin in lens capsules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Image analysis was also performed to compare the amount of fibrillin expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> capsules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Based on fibrillin staining patterns, we identified three distinct zones in the equatorial and periequatorial regions of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lens capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Zone I, a 0.75-mm-wide peripheral ring of the anterior capsule, contained radial bundles of fibrillin fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Zone II, a 1-mm-wide meshwork of fibrillin-rich fibers encircled the equator and served as an insertion platform for zonular fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Zone III was composed of radial, 0.1-mm-wide bands arranged in a periodic fashion in the most peripheral part of the posterior capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin fibers were abnormal and disrupted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three zones in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The amount of fibrillin staining per unit area was significantly reduced in Marfan capsules compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> capsules (16-26% versus 49-56% per unit area, respectively; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fibrillin was a major constituent of the peripheral and equatorial areas of the lens capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Zonular fibers, also rich in fibrillin, insert into the equatorial region, primarily in Zone II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Possibly, fibrillin played a role in the ability of the lens to change its configuration during accommodation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The observed qualitative and quantitative abnormalities in fibrillin expression in the lens capsule of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> supported a causal relationship to lens abnormalities in these patients </plain></SENT>
