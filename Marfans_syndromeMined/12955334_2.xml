<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to estimate ultrasound values in subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the study 50 patients (36 boys and 14 girls, mean age 11.8 +/- 2.9 years) and 528 healthy controls matched for age and body size (380 boys and 148 girls, mean age 11.9 +/- 2.5 years) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with the following disorders were included: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016667" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Martin-Bell syndrome</z:e>, Marfan-Mass phenotype and others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bone status was assessed by quantitative ultrasound (QUS) of hand phalanges using DBM Sonic 1200 (IGEA, Carpi, Italy), which measures amplitude-dependent speed of sound (Ad-SoS, m/s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ad-SoS was significantly lower in patients than in controls (in the whole group 1,915 +/- 69 m/s vs. 1,970 +/- 62.0 m/s, P&lt;0.0000001; in males 1,917 +/- 73 m/s vs. 1,972 +/- 63 m/s, P&lt;0.000001; in females 1,910 +/- 58 m/s vs. 1,963 +/- 58 m/s, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ad-SoS correlated significantly with age and body size (except for Ad-SoS with age in female patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subgroups of patients (except for the subjects with Marfan-Mass syndrome) Ad-SoS values were significantly lower than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a multiple, stepwise regression analysis of Ad-SoS on age and body size, in the whole group of patients age and height had significant influence on Ad-SoS, and in controls age, height and weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the study shows significantly lower phalangeal ultrasound values in subjects with different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy persons </plain></SENT>
