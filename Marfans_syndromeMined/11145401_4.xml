<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little, however, is known to date about the characteristic features of this clinical entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical, prognostic and predisposing profiles in 119 cases of dissection and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> occuring 1 month to 16 years after routine AVR were analyzed comprising 62 cases from our database and 57 reported cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dissection after AVR has been observed in 0.6% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> routine AVR procedures in the past four decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With clinical signs, symptoms and anatomical features different from classic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> post-AVR dissection is a distinct clinical entity with a high intraoperative mortality of 44% and a 30-day and 5-year survival of 62% and 43%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>Aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> and a thin and/or fragile aortic wall at AVR, however, predict late dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using a prediction model, the risk of late dissection can be stratified based on information obtained during AVR surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic dissection</z:hpo> following AVR is likely to represent a distinct clinical entity which can be predicted and possibly prevented at AVR </plain></SENT>
