<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Current knowledge concerning idiopathic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> of the mitral valve is illustrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The histopathological cause is myxoid degeneration of the mitral cusps, which sometimes extends to the tendinous cords, the valve implant ring, and the apex of the papillary muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary damage to these structures, whose intactness is essential for correct closure of the ostium, causes protrusion of the ventricular cusps into the left atrium during ventricular systole (i.e. <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reason for this degeneration is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The high familial incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> lends credit to the most widely held suggestion, namely a hereditary defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical progress is benign in the great majority of cases ("crystallized" form) and is often asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complications are possible, however, and must always be borne in mind </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They include progressive and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral insufficiency</z:hpo>, infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, motor or sensitive neurological complications, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Particular attention must be paid to the path to be followed to arrive at the correct diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Careful evaluation of some of the clinical signs arousing suspicion in the previous history and/or objective examination enable a diagnosis to be formed with relatively simple, non-invasive instrumental techniques, such as echocardiography and polycardiography, provided other forms of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e>, mitral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, etc. are excluded. "Therapy is obviously necessary in the presence of complications; however, even in "crystallized" form, in the presence of subjective symptoms, tranquillizers and possibly beta-blockers may be necessary" </plain></SENT>
