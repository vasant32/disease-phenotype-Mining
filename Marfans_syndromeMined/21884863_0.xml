<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to identify the incidence and predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> (AoDs) and to describe their associated clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed the clinical and pathologic data from 141 consecutive autopsies of individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> due to AoDs in Harris County, TX, from 2003 to 2010, which represented 20% (107/534) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> attributed to AoDs during this period by the Texas Department of Health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox regression was used to identify predictors of survival adjusting for differences in demographic and clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the study period, 141 of 145 fatal victims of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thoracic dissections underwent a full autopsy and were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 84% of cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pericardial tamponade</z:e> from ascending AoD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> showed seasonal variation with peak incidence in the winter months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients presenting to hospitals with AoD, individuals dying outside the hospital were more likely to be female, African American, younger than 50 years and to have had prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One third of subjects with AoD had seen a physician within 1 week of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most consistent pathologic abnormality was marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001714'>ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (257 g/m(2) on average) out of proportion to expected values for age, gender, and body size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hispanic patients and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital disorders</z:e>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, were significantly more likely to die of AoD at a younger age (38% vs 13%, P &lt; .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identify differences between patients hospitalized for AoD versus those who died without being hospitalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Previously unreported vulnerabilities to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> from AoD in minority populations, specifically Hispanics, were also identified that merit follow-up in prospective studies </plain></SENT>
