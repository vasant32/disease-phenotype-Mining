<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From June 2009 to March 2012, 32 patients of aortic arch dissection with primary entry tear next to the orifices of supra-aortic arteries were treated with chimney technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chimney technique was used to reconstruct left subclavian artery (n = 2) and left common carotid artery (n = 28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Double chimney technique was use to reconstruct innominate artery and left common carotid artery simultaneously in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four patients received emergency operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients survived and were followed up for 14.3 Â± 7.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No type I endoleak occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 4 patients with Type II endoleak, 3 received <z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp> occluding implantation in left subclavian artery and 1 patient in puerperium with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and pregnancy-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> syndrome recovered by conservative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No severe neurological complications and left subclavian artery <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The locations of aortic and chimney stent-grafts were stable without any migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> stent-grafts remained patent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endovascular aortic repair plus chimney technique is a safe and effective treatment for Stanford type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> involving aortic arch </plain></SENT>
