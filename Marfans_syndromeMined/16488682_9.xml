<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Because mitral valve dysfunction in adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is poorly characterized, this study compares mitral valve pathophysiology and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> with that of myxomatous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0865573" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral disease</z:e>, documents types of mitral valve operations, and assesses long-term survival and durability of mitral valve surgery in Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From May 1975 to June 2000, 27 adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> underwent mitral valve surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their valve pathophysiology and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> was compared with that of 119 patients with myxomatous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0865573" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral disease</z:e> undergoing surgery from September 1995 to March 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival and repair durability were assessed at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with myxomatous disease patients, Marfan patients had less posterior leaflet <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> (44% versus 70%, p = 0.01), more bileaflet (44% versus 28%, p = 0.09) and anterior leaflet <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> (11% versus 3%, p = 0.07), and presented earlier for surgery (age 41 +/- 12 years versus 57 +/- 13, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Marfan patients had longer and thinner leaflets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mitral valve repair was performed less frequently in Marfan (16 of 27, 59%) than myxomatous disease patients (112 of 119, 94%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>; at 10 years, survival was 80% and freedom from reoperation 96%, with only 1 reoperation among the 16 repairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mitral valve pathophysiology and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> differ between Marfan and myxomatous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264765,C0026265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral valve diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Valve repair in Marfan patients is durable and gives acceptable long-term results, even in adults who present with advanced mitral valve pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With increasing use of the modified David reimplantation operation and sparing of the aortic valve, mitral valve repair is a greater imperative, particularly since we have not had to reoperate on any Marfan patients with reimplantations </plain></SENT>
