<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ECM displays a structural role in the tissue-specific organization and takes part in the regulation of various cytokines and growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A growing body of evidences supports a narrow relationship between FBN-1 and TGF-beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Homology between FBN-1 and latent TGF-beta (LTGF) allows microfibrills to be a reservoir for this cytokine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>), a prototypic fibrillinopathy, highlights these relationships as it relates to 2 major genes that are FBN1 and TGF-beta type II receptor (TGFBR2) genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a mouse model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, an up-regulation of the TGF-beta pathway is partly responsible for the phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This FBN-1/TGF-beta relationship may play also a role in systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (SSc), a multigenic disease characterized by excessive generalised ECM deposit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Indeed, two related animal models results from both gene mutations: the <z:mp ids='MP_0001198'>Tight Skin</z:mp> 1 mouse is due to a partial in-frame duplication of the Fbn1 gene and another model conditionally overexpresses TGF-beta type I receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A better understanding of FBN-1/TGF-beta relationship appears of great importance in fibrillinopathies: it may allow reconsidering the nosologic framework of these diseases including the TGF-beta signalopathies and could lead to innovative therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
