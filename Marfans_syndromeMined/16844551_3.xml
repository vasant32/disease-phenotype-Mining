<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite the discovery in 1990 that mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene cause the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, the pathogenesis of the life-threatening dissections associated with this disease is far from elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both the massive number of known fibrillin-1 mutations that result in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> patient population and the strongly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> histology of patients' aortae presumably contribute to this lack of knowledge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a detailed ultrastructural immunoelectron microscopic and histochemical analysis of the dissected media of ascending aortae of 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and compared them with those of 6 patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and 77 individuals without known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relatively similar abnormalities were found in both patient groups, although they were more numerous and more diffusely spread in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> than in the patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most conspicuous ultrastructural defects were the formation of abrupt transverse tears in thick and compact elastic lamellae and the local breaking up of smooth muscle cell-elastic lamella connections (that largely consist of microfibrils and elastic extensions, protruding from the elastic lamellae) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This breaking up was characterized by a strongly reduced number of microfibrils and a severe shortening of the elastic extensions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, the elastic extensions detached from the lamellae to ultimately degenerate and disappear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These changes were found mainly in the oldest group of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, indicating that they represented a loss of previously normally developed structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also compared our findings with those from a recently developed murine Marfan model (Pereira L, Lee SY, Gayraud B, Andrilopoulos K, Shapiro SD, Bunton T, Biery NJ, Dietz HC, Sakai LY, Ramirez F </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Next to similarities, several striking differences existed, demonstrating that this model is not fully representative of the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
