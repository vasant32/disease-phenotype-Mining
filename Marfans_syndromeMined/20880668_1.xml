<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin-1 gene mutations may affect the carotid arterial wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate carotid arterial mechanics using Velocity Vector Imaging (VVI) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-five patients (26 men; mean age, 39 ± 10 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who fulfilled the Ghent criteria and 45 gender-matched and age-matched healthy volunteers were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transverse images of right common carotid artery proximal to the bifurcation were obtained for each subject and divided into six segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The peak radial velocity, circumferential strain, and strain rate of the six segments were analyzed using VVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The time to peak radial velocity (T(s)), peak circumferential strain (T(st)), and peak strain rate (T(sr)) of the six segments were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intima-media thickness was measured for each subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average diameter of the common carotid artery in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> was significantly larger than that of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Carotid compliance coefficients and distensibility coefficients as assessed by B-mode echocardiographic images were comparable between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In VVI analyses, averages and standard deviations of peak radial velocities, circumferential strain, and strain rates were not significantly different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, T(s), T(st), and T(sr) were more delayed (P &lt; .01), and the standard deviations of T(s), T(st), and T(sr) were significantly larger in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (P = .01, P &lt; .01, and P &lt; .01, respectively), suggesting delayed and dyssynchronous arterial expansion during systole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> was independently and significantly related to increased standard deviations of T(st) (β = 0.33, P &lt; .01) and T(sr) (β = 0.44, P &lt; .01), even after adjusting for age in multiple regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, carotid arteries assessed with VVI exhibited delayed, dyssynchronous arterial expansion during systole compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Arterial assessment using VVI may be useful for noninvasively quantifying vascular alterations associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
