<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, both forms of valve-preserving root repair were applied and mid-term results analyzed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients compared to a propensity score-matched cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among 604 patients who underwent valve-preserving aortic root surgery between 1995 and 2011 at the authors' institution, 33 MFS patients (16 males, 17 females; mean age 31 +/- 12 years) underwent either remodeling (n=21) or reimplantation (n=12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed up echocardiographically, and the outcome with regard to late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic valve regurgitation</z:hpo> (AR) grade EII and reoperation on the aortic valve was compared between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients and the matched cohort (n=33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline characteristics and operative data were similar between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Actuarial freedom from AR &gt; or = II at seven years was 86 +/- 8% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients and 90 +/- 10% in matched non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients (p = 0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Actuarial freedom from reoperation at seven years was 90 +/- 7% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients and 100% in non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients (p = 0.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Cox's proportional hazard's model, no independent risk factor, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, was found for recurrent AR or reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients, remodeling and reimplantation provided an almost identical freedom from late AR &gt; or = II and reoperation up to five years postoperatively (p = 0.55 and 0.99, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The stability of valve-preserving aortic root repair was comparable between patients with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both forms of valve-preserving root repair can provide similar mid-term results for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients, primarily according to their root geometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, additional long-term follow up data based on a larger number of patients are required to confirm the evidence obtained to date </plain></SENT>
