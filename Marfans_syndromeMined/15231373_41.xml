<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify the predictive value of aortic stiffness on the occurrence of dissection and progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In 78 non-operated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (mean age 31+/-8 years, mean aortic root diameter 43+/-6 mm, range 31-55 mm) aortic stiffness and diameters were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at multiple levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 71 months (25-75%: 68-72 months) a second MRI was performed and the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo>, defined as mean aortic diameter increase &gt;1 mm/year was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 4 (5%) of 78 patients developed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (1 type A, 2 type B, and 1 infra-renal dissection) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty (26%) of the 78 patients had progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 5 (6%) patients with progressive descending thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> and 6 (7%) with progressive abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that local distensibility was an independent predictor of progressive thoracic descending <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> (OR=4.14, 95% CI, 1.02-16.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For progressive aortic root and abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> local initial diameter appeared to be the major predictor (OR=1.37, 95% CI, 1.16-1.62; OR=1.36, 95% CI, 1.09-1.69, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> both aortic diameter and aortic distensibility are independent predictors of progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For optimal risk assessment and monitoring of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, both aortic stiffness and diameter should be assessed at least annually </plain></SENT>
