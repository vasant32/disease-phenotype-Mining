<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In 1896, in the Bulletin of the Medical Society of Paris, Antoine Marfan described a five-year-old girl with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It took almost 50 years to fully elucidate this syndrome including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is critical to make an early diagnosis of Marfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> because there is a high frequency of dissection and rupture once the aortic diameter reaches 6 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before the availability of the Bentall composite graft procedure in 1968, the operative results were very poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Bentall operation now carries a 30-day mortality rate of less than 5% at major cardiac surgical centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and thirty-one Marfan patients underwent aortic root replacement at The Johns Hopkins Hospital between September 1976 and December 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 30-day mortality for 198 patients undergoing elective aortic root replacement was 0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two of 33 patients undergoing urgent surgery died in the first 30 days after surgery; both of these patients arrived in the operating room with ruptured aortas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival for the 231 patients undergoing aortic root replacement was 88% at five years, 81% at ten years, and 75% at 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clearly, the outlook for Marfan patients undergoing elective aortic root replacement has been excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Accompanying the steadily improving surgical results have been spectacular developments in understanding the genetic role in Marfan families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Since 1991, over 150 mutations have been discovered in the gene that is critical in the production of the structural protein fibrillin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The identification of mutations in the fibrillin gene has enabled the diagnosis of Marfan disease in some patients before they become symptomatic; prenatal diagnosis has been achieved in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The ultimate hope for Marfan families is to eliminate the disease by genetic manipulation; however, this may be years away </plain></SENT>
