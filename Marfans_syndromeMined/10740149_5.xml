<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> show a hereditary abnormality of elastin metabolism that may cause aortic enlargement and dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have hypothesized that abnormal elastin may alter peripheral vascular structure and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forearm blood flow (FBF) (in milliliters per minute per 100 mL) response to the endothelium-dependent dilator <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> (0.75 to 4.5 microg/min per 100 mL), the endothelium-independent dilator <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> (0.05 to 0.3 microg/min per 100 mL), and structure-related maximum dilator response (10-minute occlusion-induced reactive hyperemia) were measured by plethysmograph in 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (mean age 44 years) and 10 healthy age- and sex-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with the complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Basal FBF (mean +/- SE) did not differ between the 2 groups (2.7 +/- 0.3 vs 2.3 +/- 0.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Maximum FBF response to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> was significantly lower than that of healthy controls (8.5 +/- 2.1 vs 15.4 +/- 1.7 mL/min per 100 mL; P &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reactive hyperemia was also lower in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (at peak 23.0 +/- 2.5 vs 29.5 +/- 2.3 mL/min per 100 mL; P &lt;.05), but <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi>-induced FBF changes did not differ between the 2 groups (10.3 +/- 1.1 vs 10.2 +/- 1.5 mL/min per 100 mL; P = not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These observations suggest that endothelium-dependent dilation and maximum dilator reserve capacity are both abnormal in peripheral resistance vessels of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These peripheral vasomotion abnormalities may have a detrimental impact on the cardiovascular system in this disorder </plain></SENT>
