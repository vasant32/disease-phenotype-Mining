<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because surgical therapy with a composite graft may alter this natural history, we analyzed the preoperative and long-term postoperative status of 50 consecutive patients who received such a graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At surgery, the patients had a mean age of 32.2 years and a mean aortic diameter of 7.1 cm (range, 5.3 to 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dissection of the ascending aorta was present in 14 patients and was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> in 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the 44 patients who underwent elective repair, and only one of the six patients who had emergency surgery, died in the hospital; thus, the overall hospital mortality was 2 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five of the 49 survivors died during a follow-up period of up to eight years (10.2 percent late mortality) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the most recent four years of evaluation of this series (38 patients), no postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> due to intrathoracic problems occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival was 87 percent at both two and five years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Composite-graft repair of the ascending aorta in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> can be performed with low operative and long-term mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because of the unfavorable natural history of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and the potential for dissection in moderately <z:mp ids='MP_0011575'>dilated aortic roots</z:mp>, we recommend prophylactic repair when the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> reaches a diameter of 6 cm </plain></SENT>
