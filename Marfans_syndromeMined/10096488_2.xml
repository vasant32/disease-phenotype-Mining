<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to evaluate early results with the Carbo-seal composite conduit for aortic root replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of 21 patients operated on for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> and/or dissection with the open technique between August 1993 and February 1998 is presented; 12 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and nine were non-Marfan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were two operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (9.5%) due to low cardiac output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients were re-explored for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> which was not due to transgraft <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperative complications were one <z:hpo ids='HP_0012151'>hemothorax</z:hpo>, one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo> and two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the follow up, one patient died of rupture of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0004954'>descending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo>, and one patient in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the closing of the follow up, the remaining patients were well and free of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Carbo-seal may be considered a reliable device for use in aortic root replacement, though a longer follow up and a larger patient population are necessary to confirm these positive early results </plain></SENT>
