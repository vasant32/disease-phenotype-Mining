<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We aimed at evaluating the results of aortic valve-sparing root replacement (AVSRR) in children with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (ARA) due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> in terms of mortality, reoperation and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic valve regurgitation</z:hpo> (AVR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen patients (mean age 9.7 ± 6.5 years, 10 months-18 years) underwent AVSRR for ARA between 2002 and 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six of the 13 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, 3 Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> syndrome and 2 an unspecified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AVR was graded as none/trace, mild and severe in 5, 7 and 1 patient, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean pre-operative root diameter was 45 ± 10 mm (mean Z-score 10.3 ± 2.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Remodelling of the aortic root was performed in 4 patients, reimplantation of the aortic valve in 9 and a concomitant cusp repair in 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the prostheses used for root replacement varied from 22 to 30 mm (mean Z-score = 2.3 ± 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The follow-up was 100% complete with a mean follow-up time of 3.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no operative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient with LDS died 2.5 years after the operation due to spontaneous rupture of the descending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Root re-replacement with mechanical conduit was necessary in 1 patient for severe recurrent AVR 8 days after remodelling of the aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At final follow-up, AVR was graded as none/trace and mild in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients presented in New York Heart Association functional Class I and 1 in Class II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In paediatric patients with ARA, valve-sparing root replacement can be performed with low operative risk and excellent mid-term valve durability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Hence, prosthetic valve-related morbidity may be avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Due to the large diameters of the aortic root and the ascending aorta, the size of the implanted root prostheses will not limit later growth of the native aorta </plain></SENT>
