<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A family in which the five members including the identical twins had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> was described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>None of these members had any known stigmata of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and their auscultatory findings were different each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>M-mode echocardiograms disclosed a midsystolic buckling of the mitral valve in the identical twins, their parents and the mother's brother, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiograms revealed a wandering pacemaker in two members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The index case was a 13-year-old girl whose apical late systolic murmur was detected incidentally by the mass screening examination for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both the inhalation of amyl <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> and injection of methoxamine induced the augmentation of this murmur and made it holosystolic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The identical twin of the index case had multiple apical non-ejection clicks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, a mitral regurgitant murmur was not induced by pharmacological provocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional echocardiograms revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> of both the anterior and posterior mitral valve leaflets in both of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Their mother had a late systolic click and the mother's brother had a cardiopulmonary murmur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The abnormal auscultatory findings were not observed in their father </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This familial study suggested the genetic background and the various clinical manifestations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
