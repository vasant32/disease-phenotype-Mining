<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Records relating to 53 eyes of 45 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who underwent surgery for rhegmatogenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 53 eyes, 24 (45.3%) underwent scleral buckling as the first procedure and 29 (54.7%) underwent vitrectomy surgery with scleral buckle as the first procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Main outcome measures included clinical characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo>, reattachment rates, and functional improvement in vision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Characteristic findings included total <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> in 40 (75.5%) eyes, atrophic holes in 24 (45.3%) eyes, more than four <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> breaks in 21 eyes (39.6%), preequatorial and postequatorial breaks in 20 (37.7%) eyes, giant <z:mp ids='MP_0003099'>retinal tears</z:mp> in six (11.3%) eyes, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">proliferative vitreoretinopathy</z:e> (posterior, anterior, or both) in nine (17%) eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 30 (56.6%) eyes, <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> breaks were located only in the temporal half of the retina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 24 eyes with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo>, 13 (54.2%) had a myopic correction greater than 7 diopters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the median follow-up of 10.7 months, complete <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> reattachment was obtained in 87.6% and 86.2% of patients undergoing scleral buckling (including additional procedures such as vitrectomy) and vitrectomy surgery, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In eyes with reattached retinas, a final visual acuity of 20/200 or better was obtained in 81% of the patients after scleral buckling and in 56% of the patients after vitrectomy surgery (P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>Retinal detachment</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is complete in 75% of the eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More than half (56%) the eyes had a <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> break only in the temporal half of the retina, and 83% had at least a break in the temporal half of the retina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Currently available vitreoretinal surgical techniques result in successful reattachment of the retina in approximately 86% of the eyes </plain></SENT>
