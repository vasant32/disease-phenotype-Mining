<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, six of the seven mutations involving substitutions of highly conserved <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32460">cysteine residues</z:chebi> exhibited lower rates of intracellular transport and secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This effect is likely due to improper folding, since intracellular fibrillin processing was also affected by the reducing agent dithiothreitol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> secretion patterns were seen in three mutations that either change the conformation of EGF-like domains or change consensus amino acids required for Ca(++)-binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nine fibroblasts strains, however, the deposition of fibrillin in the extracellular matrix was reduced to 50% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in two and to less than 30% in seven of the nine samples studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The protein alterations caused by these missense mutations are associated with moderate to severe features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and a dominant negative mechanism is suggested to play a major role in their pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
