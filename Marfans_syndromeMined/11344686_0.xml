<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Ross procedure has been used increasingly to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic valve disease</z:e> in children and young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary indication for the Ross procedure is to provide a permanent valve replacement in children with congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More recently, it has been extended to young adults with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> and small aortic annulus, especially women wishing to have children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other possible indications include complex left ventricular outflow obstructive disease, native or prosthetic valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, and adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> with a dilated aortic annulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conversely, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is considered to an absolute contraindication, and this procedure should be used with caution in patients with rheumatic valve disease and a dysplastic <z:mp ids='MP_0011575'>dilated aortic root</z:mp> because of the higher associated incidence of autograft dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The technique of total aortic root replacement has become the preferred method of autograft implantation, because it carries the lowest risk of pulmonary autograft failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with marked graft-host size mismatch, either concomitant aortic annulus reduction and fixation or aortic annulus enlargement (i.e., the Ross-Konno procedure) should be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Ross Procedure International Registry data document that in the modern era (post-1986) the early and late mortality rate is 2.5% and 1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Excellent long-term results have been reported, and the benefits of this procedure include optimal hemodynamics, low risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002409'>resistance to infection</z:mp> in patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, and nonthrombogeneicity and therefore few anticoagulation-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Ross procedure can be performed with acceptable early and mid-term mortality and excellent autograft durability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further long-term follow-up will confirm the role of this procedure in patients with various types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic valve disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
