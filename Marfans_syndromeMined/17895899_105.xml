<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It seems that elastic extracellular matrix (ECM) components have a crucial role in controlling TGFbeta signalling, while soluble and membrane bound forms of TGFbeta co-receptors add further layers of regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Together, these extracellular interactions determine the final bioavailability of TGFbeta to vascular cells, and dysregulation is associated with an increasing number of vascular pathologies </plain></SENT>
