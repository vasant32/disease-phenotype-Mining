<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The independently performed genetic assignment of the Marfan locus and classical biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses complemented each other in the search for the Marfan gene defect and in 1991 the fibrillin gene in chromosome 15 was identified as the Marfan gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>So far, three mutations leading to the Marfan phenotype have been reported in this gene coding for a microfibrillar protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The available data suggests a wide spectrum of different mutations of fibrillin and although mutations of the fibrillin gene account for the majority of Marfan cases, evidence also exists for locus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in a minority of Marfan cases </plain></SENT>
