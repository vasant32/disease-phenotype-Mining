<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin-1 is a major structural component of 10-12 nm connective tissue microfibrils and has a modular organisation that includes 43 calcium binding epidermal growth factor-like (cbEGF) domains and seven transforming growth factor beta-binding protein-like (TB) domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene cause the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) and related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously investigated an N2144S change, identified in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patient, which removes one of the key calcium binding ligands within cbEGF domain 32 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study the structural consequences of the N2144S amino acid change for the folding and calcium binding properties of mutant and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> TB6-cbEGF32 and cbEGF32-33 domain pairs have been analysed by nuclear magnetic resonance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of an N2144S substitution does not alter the native fold of either the TB6 domain, or cbEGF domains 32 and 33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison of calcium dissociation constants measured for the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and mutant pairs shows that: (i) the affinity of cbEGF32 is weakly enhanced by N-terminal linkage of TB6 relative to cbEGF32 in isolation; (ii) the affinity of cbEGF32 is approximately ninefold decreased by the N2144S substitution in the TB-cbEGF pair; and (iii) reduced affinity of cbEGF32 does not result in lower affinity of cbEGF33 for calcium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together, these data suggest that the TB6-cbEGF32 linkage is flexible and the structural effect of the mutation is localised to the interdomain linkage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have also investigated the effect of defective calcium binding to cbEGF32 on fibrillin-1 produced by N2144S <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>-pulse-chase analysis shows that the N2144S substitution does not detectably affect fibrillin-1 biosynthesis, rate of secretion or processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Deposition of reducible fibrillin-1 into the extracellular matrix was also unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The implications of these results for the assembly and properties of the microfibril are discussed </plain></SENT>
