<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommending prophylactic aortic root replacement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> are based on absolute diameters of the aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, aortic root diameter is a function of body surface area (BSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report our experience with a protocol for prophylactic aortic root replacement based on BSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with established <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (Ghent criteria) and without prior aortic surgery were eligible for our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aortic root ratio was defined as the ratio between the observed aortic root diameter (as measured during annual echocardiography) and the maximum predicted aortic root diameter as calculated according to age and BSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Replacement surgery was performed if <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the aortic root during follow-up resulted in an aortic root ratio &gt;/=1.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-three patients fulfilled the entry criteria (24 men/29 women, median age at baseline 27 years, range 18-59 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During follow-up between 1997 and 2007 (mean 4.7+/-3.2 years) four patients underwent uncomplicated aortic root replacement; two had an aortic root ratio &gt;/=1.3 (aortic root diameters were 4.9 and 5.2 cm, respectively), one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> of 0.4 cm/year and a positive family history for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and one had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta as the primary indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the patients in the whole group suffered from type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and there was no mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although numbers are small, our protocol for prophylactic aortic root replacement in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> based on BSA was effective in terms of preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and mortality </plain></SENT>
