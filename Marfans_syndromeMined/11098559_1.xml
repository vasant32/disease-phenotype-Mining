<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Every <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection involving the ascending aorta (Stanford type A) must undergo emergency surgical repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the surgical techniques must vary according to the clinical presentation of the patients or the anatomical patterns observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, surgery is generally difficult because of the poor condition of the aortic tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To reduce those difficulties many technical artifacts have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 1977, we proposed the use of gelatin-resorcin-formalin (GRF) biological glue to reinforce the suture areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From January 1977 to July 1999, 212 patients (pts) (152 males and 60 females) aged from 15 to 80 years (mean age: 54 +/- 11 years) underwent an emergency operation for type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One-hundred-seventy-eight pts (84%) were operated on within 4 hours after being referred to the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight pts (13.2%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 44 patients (20.7%), the aortic valve was replaced either independently (6 cases--2.8%) or by means of a composite graft (38 cases--17.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because of the location of the intimal tear, the aortic replacement was extended to the transverse arch in 61 pts (28.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hospital mortality amounts to 21.6% (46 pts), 25% in pts with arch replacement and 19.4% in pts without arch replacement (n.s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Analysis of hospital mortality demonstrates that the main causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac tamponade</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurologic disorders</z:e> and visceral malperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One-hundred-sixty-six pts were discharged and surveyed from 5 months to 22 years postoperatively (mean follow-up: 85 +/- 66 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During this period of time, 25 pts (15%) had to be reoperated for a total of 33 reoperations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Seven pts (28%) died at reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Using univariate analysis, the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (p &lt; 0.05) and absence of arch replacement (p &lt; 0.02) were determinant risk factors for reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Emergency (p &lt; 0.01) and thoraco-abdominal replacement (p &lt; 0.04) were determinant riskfactors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The freedom from reoperation (Kaplan-Meier, CI: 95%) is 96% (90-98), 87% (79-92), 80% (70-88), 66% (51-78) at 1, 5, 10 and 15 years respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>A total of 39 pts (24.3%) died during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (p &lt; 0.01), reoperation (p &lt; 0.02), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05) were determinant risk factors of late mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The late survival rate (K-M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>C.I.: 95%), including hospital mortality, is 71% (64-77), 66% (58-73), 56% (47-64), 46% (36-56), 37% (28-44) at 1, 10, 15 and 20 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>From our experience extending over more than 23 years, GRF glue has proved to be extremely useful, making the procedure much easier and safer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, many factors are of importance in the pre-, intra- and postoperative management of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cardiac tamponade</z:e> and visceral malperfusion must be properly diagnosed and treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>During aortic repair, the main intimal tear must be resected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The transverse arch must be checked and replaced whenever necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The aortic valve should be preserved whenever possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>During CPB, perfusing the aorta in the regular antegrade manner seems to dramatically reduce the rate of malperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The quality of the first emergency operation seems to have a major influence on the late results, especially concerning the rate of late reoperations and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003496" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic ruptures</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>However, those late results depend also on the patient's basic condition, particularly in Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
