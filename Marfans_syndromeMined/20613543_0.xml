<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, to study potential correlations between the scores on the subscales of Short Form 36 and the presence of biomedical criteria and symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Short Form 36 was investigated in 84 adults with verified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study group had reduced scores on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight subscales of Short Form 36 compared with the general population, comparable with other groups with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with earlier Short Form 36 results in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, we found lower scores for social function, vitality, general health, bodily pain, and role physical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No correlations of substantial explanatory values were found between the Short Form 36 subscales and gender, body mass index, ascending aortic surgery, use of beta-blockers, visual acuity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001382'>joint hypermobility</z:hpo>, fulfillment of the five major Ghent criteria, and number of major criteria fulfilled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Potential explanations are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Persons with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> have reduced scores for health-related quality of life as measured with Short Form 36, comparable with those in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disorders and disabilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reduction does not seem to be related to biomedical criteria or symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
