<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The treatment induced disorganization of the interbead domains although the regular beaded arrangement was always apparent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These changes were readily reversible on replacing calcium, indicating that the treatment had not compromised microfibrillar integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data localize calcium binding EGF-like repeats to the interbead domains and indicate that lateral packing of fibrillin monomers is calcium-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This arrangement suggests how mutations in epidermal growth factor-like domains of fibrillin might cause the disruption in microfibril organization and interactions which underlies the clinical symptoms of some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
