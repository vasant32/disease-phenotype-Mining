<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the presence of any regional myocardial deformation abnormalities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) and determine the benefits of using advanced echocardiography compared to conventional techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Myocardial dysfunction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> may be caused by extracellular matrix remodeling thus, resulting in uniform reduced functionality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, increased aortic stiffness may cause segmental ventricular abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Strain rate imaging (SRI) constitutes a validated technique to assess regional deformation in various clinical conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With this in mind, we aimed to investigate biventricular function in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> using SRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients (mean age 30 ± 12 years, 26 men) and 49 controls without valvular disease were examined using SRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ejection fraction (EF) was calculated by the Simpson's biplane method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Biventricular deformation was assessed by measuring strain/strain rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Strain values were divided by left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume to adjust LV deformation for geometry changes providing a strain index (SI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aortic stiffness was evaluated using the β-stiffness index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EF (%) was reduced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients (59 ± 5 vs 72 ± 4, P &lt; 0.001), whereas β-stiffness was increased (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LV radial and LV and right ventricular (RV) long-axis strain values (%) were reduced in the patient group (70 ± 17 vs 93 ± 10; 19 ± 2 vs 25 ± 2; 30 ± 9 vs 36 ± 8, respectively, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Strain rate measurements were also reduced (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In a multiple regression analysis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> diagnosis was negatively associated with LV SI (-0.262 [-0.306, -0.219], P &lt; 0.001). β-Stiffness was negatively associated with SI obtained from the septum, inferior and anterior walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>ROC analyses demonstrated that SRI, when compared with conventional echocardiography, had higher sensitivity and specificity in predicting biventricular dysfunction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed a uniform reduction in biventricular deformation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that assessment of myocardial function using advanced echocardiographic techniques could be more accurate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patient evaluation than conventional echocardiography alone </plain></SENT>
