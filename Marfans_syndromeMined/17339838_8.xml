<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Aortic complications account for the major mortality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>), a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> caused by mutations in FBN1 encoding fibrillin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> impaired endothelial function and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) production in the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Mice (at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of age) heterozygous for the Fbn1 allele encoding a cysteine substitution (Fbn1 (C1039G/+), Marfan mice, n=75), the most common class of mutation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, were compared with age-matched control littermates (n=75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thoracic and abdominal aortas from the two groups were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: Isometric force measurements revealed that relaxation to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> (but not to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi>) was diminished in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi>-precontracted Marfan thoracic aorta at 6 months of age (pEC(50)=6.12+/-0.22; maximal response, E(max)=52.7+/-6.8%; control: pEC(50)=7.34+/-0.19; E(max)=84.8+/-2.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At one year, both inhibition of NO production with N(omega)-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi>, or denudation of endothelium increased the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi>-stimulated contraction in the control thoracic aorta by 35%, but had no effect in the Marfan aorta, indicating a loss of basal NO production in the Marfan vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From 6 months, a reduced phosphorylation of endothelial NOS (eNOS)(Ser1177) and Akt(Thr308) detected by Western blotting was observed in the Marfan thoracic aorta, which was accompanied by decreased levels of cGMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expressions of Akt and eNOS in the abdominal aorta were not different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> impairs endothelial function and signaling of NO production in the thoracic aorta, suggesting the importance of NO in the age-related progression of thoracic aortic manifestations </plain></SENT>
