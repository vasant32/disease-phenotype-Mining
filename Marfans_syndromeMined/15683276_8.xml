<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To explore the safety and feasibility of stent-graft placement in the dissected descending thoracic aorta of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six consecutive patients (4 men; mean age 33+/-15 years, range 24-61) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> were offered endovascular repair for dissection after previous aortic root repair in 5 and solitary type B dissection in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Transluminal placement of customized Talent stent-grafts was technically successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, with no 30-day or 1-year intervention-related mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complete abolition of the dissection and reconstruction of the entire dissected aorta was documented in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Over a mean 51+/-22-month follow-up (range 12-74), elective conversion to surgical repair was necessary in 2 patients at 22 and 43 months after stent-graft implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a third patient, conversion to surgery is being considered at 74 months after stent-grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient died suddenly 12 months after endovascular repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nonsurgical reconstruction of postsurgical distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is feasible and technically successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stent-graft placement may either avoid or bridge to repeat surgery of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> after previous aortic root repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Technical expertise and close postinterventional surveillance appear mandatory and may limit the procedure to centers of competence for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
