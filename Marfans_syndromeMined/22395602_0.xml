<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the mouse, blood flow is first detectable around embryonic day (E) 8.5(1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Systolic left ventricular (LV) pressure is 2 mmHg at E9.5 and 11 mmHg at E14.5(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At these mid-embryonic stages, the LV is clearly visible through the chest wall for invasive pressure measurements because the ribs and skin are not fully developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Between E14.5 and birth (approximately E21) imaging methods must be used to view the LV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After birth, mean arterial pressure increases from 30 - 70 mmHg from postnatal day (P) 2 - 35(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Beyond P20, arterial pressure can be measured with solid-state catheters (i.e. Millar or Scisense) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Before P20, these catheters are too big for developing mouse arteries and arterial pressure must be measured with custom pulled plastic catheters attached to fluid-filled pressure transducers(3) or glass micropipettes attached to servo null pressure transducers(4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our recent work has shown that the greatest increase in blood pressure occurs during the late embryonic to early postnatal period in mice(5-7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This large increase in blood pressure may influence smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotype in developing arteries and trigger important mechanotransduction events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In human disease, where the mechanical properties of developing arteries are compromised by defects in extracellular matrix proteins (i.e. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's Syndrome</z:e>(8) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004381'>Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis</z:hpo>(9)) the rapid changes in blood pressure during this period may contribute to disease phenotype and severity through alterations in mechanotransduction signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is important to be able to measure blood pressure changes during late embryonic and neonatal periods in mouse models of human disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We describe a method for measuring LV pressure in late embryonic (E18) and early postnatal (P1 - 20) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A needle attached to a fluid-filled pressure transducer is inserted into the LV under ultrasound guidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Care is taken to maintain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardiac function during the experimental protocol, especially for the embryonic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Representative data are presented and limitations of the protocol are discussed </plain></SENT>
