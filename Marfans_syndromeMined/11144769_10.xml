<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> may develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340646" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic root dissection</z:e> despite only mild aortic root dilation as shown by standard echocardiography, which may be due to aortic root asymmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Purpose of the present study was to investigate aortic root asymmetry by magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and to compare these measurements with standardly performed echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-seven Marfan patients (mean age 31 +/- 8 years) underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From this population, 15 patients (mean age 29 +/- 3 years) were selected in whom both echocardiography and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging had been performed within 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With echocardiography, the aortic root was measured according to the recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, a short axis view of the aortic root was obtained to measure distances between the noncoronary, right coronary and left coronary cusps and the aortic root area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correlations between aortic root area and diameters were assessed, and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No difference in the standardly measured noncoronary to right coronary cusp diameter between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and echocardiography was shown (42 +/- 6 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Largest aortic root diameter on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images was the right to left coronary cusp diameter (46 +/- 7 mm, p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For a given noncoronary to right coronary cusp diameter, 95% confidence intervals revealed a variation of -20 to +20% in the aortic root area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The majority of Marfan patients show asymmetric dilation of the aortic root by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon may go unnoticed when standard echocardiography is performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The asymmetry of the aortic root might be of clinical importance in unexpected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340646" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic root dissection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
