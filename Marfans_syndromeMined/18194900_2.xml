<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The delayed diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo> was due to a negative prior neonatal screen which was checked when he was a breastfed healthy newborn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the absence of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> family history, and because of prior poor school performance, amino acid analysis and mutational analysis of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17755">cystathionine</z:chebi> beta-synthase gene were performed, which revealed the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Low methionine diet with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="27306">vitamin B6</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi>, betaine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> and aspirin was prescribed for emergency ophthalmologic surgery to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fortunately, the operation was completed uneventfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient has been followed-up for 4 years without any significant complaints under diet and medical control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo> is easily missed in neonatal screening programs, it should be suspected in patients who present with lenticular subluxation, even after a negative neonatal screen </plain></SENT>
