<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed data from 422 of 457 consecutive patients who underwent endovascular thoracic repair with the Medtronic Talent thoracic stent-graft (Medtronic/AVE, Santa Rosa, Calif) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, 16 patients (3.8%) required late conversion to open surgery during a median follow-up interval of 17 months (range 7-33 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six of these patients had undergone previous aortic surgery, 3 patients had previous cardiac surgery, and 5 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with late conversion, indications for primary stent-graft placement were dissection in 10 patients, degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in 5 patients, and penetrating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By multivariable Cox analysis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (adjusted hazard ratio 9.97, P = .008), type I endoleak (adjusted hazard ratio 3.99, P = .012), the use of more than 1 stent-graft (adjusted hazard ratio 3.89, P = .018), and procedural complications (adjusted hazard ratio 17.50, P = .003) were independent predictors of late conversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endovascular treatment for thoracic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> with the Talent stent-graft is associated with a relatively low rate of late conversion to conventional surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Better results may be achieved by excluding patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> for such a procedure and early aggressive treatment of early type I endoleaks </plain></SENT>
