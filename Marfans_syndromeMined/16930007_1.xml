<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical diagnosis is based on a set of well-defined clinical criteria (Ghent nosology) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the age-related nature of some clinical manifestations and the variable phenotypic expression of the disorder may hamper the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In those instances, molecular analysis of the FBN1 gene is helpful to identify at-risk individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations are spread over the entire FBNJ gene and there are no particular hot spots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Different standard methodologies are available to identify these mutations, however, one of the most sensitive techniques is denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This approach allows the performance of the analysis in a semi-automated manner and has a mutation detection rate of approx 95% </plain></SENT>
