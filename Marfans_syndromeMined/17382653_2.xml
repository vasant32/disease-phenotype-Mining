<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study sought to determine whether it is associated with adverse neurologic outcome in the postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were collected from a retrospective chart review of 142 patients in whom total aortic arch replacement was planned at the Cleveland Clinic between April 2000 and December 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had preoperative brain magnetic resonance imaging evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Leukoaraiosis severity was rated semiquantitatively using the Schelten's scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperative neurologic injuries were investigated by clinical examination and appropriate neuroimaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They were stratified as type 1 (focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>) and type 2 (nonfocal neurocognitive changes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002197'>generalized seizures</z:hpo>) injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The following were independent predictors of type 1 neurologic injury: age (odds ratio 1.06 [1.01-1.13], P = .02) and moderate to severe aortic atheroma (odds ratio 4.4 [1.4-9.7], P = .012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Total white matter scores (odds ratio 1.16 [1.06-1.27], P = .002) and higher preoperative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c levels (odds ratio 1.8 [1.00-3.50], P = .05) were significantly associated with type 2 neurologic injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Survival was 96%, and 4.2% had persistent focal neurologic deficits at the time of hospital discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Leukoaraiosis is a significant independent predictor of nonfocal postoperative neurologic morbidity following aortic arch replacement surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Preoperative evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging allows identification of a patient subgroup at risk and implementation of strategies aimed at improving neurologic outcome </plain></SENT>
