<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The evaluation of aortic root dilation is of major importance for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with diverse diseases, including the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, we noted that the available nomograms suggested a lower aortic root dilation rate in adults (75%) than in children (90%), when the opposite would have been expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To establish new nomograms, we selected a population of 353 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We took transthoracic echocardiographic measurements of the aortic root diameters at the level of the aortic annulus, sinuses of Valsalva, sinotubular junction, and ascending aorta according to the American Society of Echocardiography recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> diameters correlated well with the height, weight, body surface area, and age (r = 0.75 to 0.84, p &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Covariance analysis adjusting for body surface area showed slightly larger diameters at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva in male children than in female children (+1 mm, p = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Equations and derived nomograms were developed, giving the upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (allowing simple recognition of <z:mp ids='MP_0010574'>aortic dilation</z:mp>) and the Z score (allowing fine quantification of dilation and differentiation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> growth from pathologic dilation) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 aortic root diameters (ie, aortic annulus, sinuses of Valsalva, sinotubular junction, and proximal ascending aorta) according to body surface area and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We applied the nomograms to 282 children with confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, of whom 65.2% presented with dilation of the sinuses of Valsalva </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we propose equations to calculate the upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and Z-score for aortic root diameters measured by 2-dimensional echocardiography, which should be useful tools for the diagnosis and follow-up of aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in children </plain></SENT>
