<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin assembly involves complex multistep mechanisms to result in a periodical head-to-tail alignment in microfibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Impaired assembly potentially plays a role in the molecular pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> caused by mutations in fibrillin-1 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>) and fibrillin-2 (congenital contractural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Presently, the basic molecular interactions involved in fibrillin assembly are obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we have generated recombinant full-length human fibrillin-1, and two overlapping recombinant <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> spanning the entire human fibrillin-2 in a mammalian expression system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Characterization by gel electrophoresis, electron microscopy after rotary shadowing, and reactivity with antibodies demonstrated correct folding of these recombinant <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analyses of homotypic and heterotypic interaction repertoires showed N- to C-terminal binding of fibrillin-1, and of fibrillin-1 with fibrillin-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The interactions were of high affinity with dissociation constants in the low nanomolar range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the N- and C-terminal fibrillin-2 polypeptides did not interact with each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that fibrillins can directly interact in an N- to C-terminal fashion to form homotypic fibrillin-1 or heterotypic fibrillin-1/fibrillin-2 microfibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This conclusion was further strengthened by double immunofluorescence labeling of microfibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, the binding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> as well as the entire fibrillin molecules displayed very stable properties </plain></SENT>
