<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 2000 and 2008, 65 patients underwent repair of AAAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-four pre-, intra- and post-operative variables were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 26.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age was 61years; 60% were male and five had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At presentation, ischaemic ECG changes were seen in 45%, malperfusion syndrome in 59%, moderate-severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> in 48% and tamponade in 16% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EF was &lt;40% in 17% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a delay of &gt;12hours between diagnosis and operation in 64% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Axillary cannulation was performed in 37% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cerebral protection was by hypothermic arrest (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e>) alone (19%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> with retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP) (11%), or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> with antegrade cerebral perfusion (<z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi>) (46%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The procedure was performed on cross-clamp in 24% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Full arch replacement was performed in 14% and concomitant coronary artery grafting was performed in 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Post-operative neurological dysfunction was present in 33.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The only significant predictor of poor neurological outcome was full arch replacement (p=0.04) on univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In-hospital OR 30 mortality was 23.53% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Significant predictors of mortality were low ejection fraction (p=0.017) and post-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> (p=0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Long-term survival was 70% at two years, 50% at five years and 25% at nine years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Functional outcomes and long-term quality of life were assessed in 69% of patients who were alive at last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Ninety percent of patients reported minimal limitation on functional scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Quality of life was assessed using the EQ-5D questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight percent of patients recorded full health with an overall mean index of 0.854 (where the best possible score is 1) using the US preference weighted index score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Discharged patients have reasonable long-term survival and good quality of life </plain></SENT>
