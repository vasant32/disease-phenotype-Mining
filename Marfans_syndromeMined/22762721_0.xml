<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed, from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2011, the data from 1,812 patients (mean age 51.1 Â± 10.9 years; 77.5% men) with AAD (726 with type A and 1,086 with type B) from 19 large hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and presented with an abrupt <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of chest and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with type A AAD were more likely to present with typical symptoms and signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography was the most common initial imaging modality, used in 76.3% of patients with an AAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 17.7%, with most of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurring within the first week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgery was used in 75.3% of patients with type A AAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mortality in this cohort was 33.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Endovascular treatment was performed in 76.1% of patients with type B AAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate was 2.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (odds ratio 2.80, p &lt;0.001), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (odds ratio 1.76, p = 0.017), anterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> (odds ratio 1.62, p = 0.004), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> (odds ratio 1.51, p = 0.041), migrating pain (odds ratio 1.56, p = 0.04), and arch vessel involvement (odds ratio 1.70, p &lt;0.001) were predictive factors for increased in-hospital mortality in patients with an AAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our study has provided insight into the current profiles and outcomes of AAD in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This knowledge might be useful for clinicians when diagnosing and treating these patients </plain></SENT>
