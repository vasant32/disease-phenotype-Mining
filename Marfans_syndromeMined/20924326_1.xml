<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> is well recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Successful treatment and prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> is going to be dependent upon an improved understanding of the molecular and physiologic events which predispose to dissection development and propagation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this review, we will focus on the elastic fiber, one of the critical elements of the aortic wall matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mechanical or functional failure of the elastin in the wall of the aorta likely predisposes to dissection as well as the post-dissection aortic degeneration with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insight into the role of the elastin and the elastic fiber in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> has recently been accelerated by research into the molecular mechanisms associated with hereditary propensity for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These studies have implicated both structural and metabolic contributions of alterations in the scaffolding proteins in matrix elastic fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In particular, increased transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) activity may play a prominent role in predisposing the aortic wall to dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The events which predispose to post-dissection aortic degeneration are somewhat less well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the loss of the structural integrity of the remaining elastic fibers leaves the wall weaker and prone to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It appears likely that the upregulation of several potent proteases, particularly those of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family such as MMP-9, are participating in the subsequent matrix damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Novel medical treatments based on this pathologic data have been proposed and in some cases have made it to clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The ongoing study evaluating whether therapeutic inhibition of TGF-β may be useful in reducing the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in patients at high risk represents one promising new strategy in the treatment of this deadly disease </plain></SENT>
