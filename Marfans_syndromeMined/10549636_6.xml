<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the distribution of transglutaminase (TGase) activity in ocular tissues and the target structures for cross-linking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cryosections from human and cynomolgus monkey eyes were incubated with the biotinylated <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> donor substrate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18127">cadaverine</z:chebi> (biotC), which was subsequently visualized with streptavidin-peroxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Confocal laser scanning was used to colocalize biotC and fibrillin, a major component of elastic microfibrils and the zonular fibers in particular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cryosections and isolated bovine zonules were treated with purified TGase 2 and biotC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The distribution of different TGases (1, 2, 3, and factor XIII) was confirmed immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ocular tissues showed TGase activity with a remarkable preponderance for the ciliary body, zonular fibers, and blood vessel walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Confocal laser scanning revealed fibrillin-containing microfibrils as a major target for TGase activity, in particular the ciliary zonules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Corneal epithelium and basement membrane showed a TGase cross-linking pattern similar to skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment of cryosections and isolated bovine zonular fibers with purified TGase 2 led to additional incorporation of biotC into extracellular matrix, particularly zonular fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemically predominant TGase 2 was associated with epithelia and particularly with connective tissue fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TGase 1 was restricted to the corneal epithelium, whereas factor XIII was found to be associated only with blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TGase 3 was absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TGase 2 appears to be an important cross-linker and thus stabilizer of ocular connective tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In particular, the zonular fibers are a major target for TGase 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This is of relevance in hereditary microfibrillopathies such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, which exhibits distinct ocular manifestations such as elongated bulbus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo>, and subluxation of the lens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Purified or recombinant TGase might be of therapeutic use in the future </plain></SENT>
