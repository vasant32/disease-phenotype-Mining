<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30411">cobalamin</z:chebi> C (CblC) defect have combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0012120'>methylmalonic aciduria</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, the gene responsible for the CblC type, MMACHC, was identified, which enables molecular diagnostics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we describe two siblings, a 16-year-old girl and her 11-year-old brother, of a consanguineous family who presented with a very distinct clinical manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The girl presented at the age of 13 years with macrocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, cognitive regression and Marfanoid features such as increased arm-span, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo>, joint hyperlaxity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Her brother presented at the age of 10 months with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> and behavioural abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biochemical analysis showed severely increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30860">methylmalonic acid</z:chebi> levels in plasma of both siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, plasma cysteine levels were decreased in the girl but not in her brother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of CblC defect was confirmed by genomic sequencing of the coding exons of the MMACHC gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two heterozygous mutations were identified in both siblings; the common c.271dupA p.Arg91LysfsX14 and a novel mutation, c.1A &gt; G p.Met1? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therapy consisting of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="14" ids="27306">vitamin B6</z:chebi>, l-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> and intramuscular <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> resulted in a clear improvement of biochemical parameters and, importantly, resulted in amelioration of the Marfanoid features in the girl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data might suggest that low cysteine levels account for the Marfanoid features observed in the girl and indicate that the CblC type of combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0012120'>methylmalonic aciduria</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo> should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with Marfanoid features </plain></SENT>
