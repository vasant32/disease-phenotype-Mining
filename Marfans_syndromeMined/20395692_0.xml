<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICCs</z:e> include <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo>, inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathies</z:e> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020445" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">familial hypercholesterolaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological data on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICCs</z:e> are sparse but a survey of the available literature suggests that there are approximately 340,000 prevalent cases of these conditions in the UK (population 61 million) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a result of dramatic advances in understanding of the molecular pathology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICCs</z:e>, more than 50 ICCs have been recognised, and diagnostic genetic tests are increasingly available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As part of a needs assessment and review of provision of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> services, a survey of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> UK <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> services was undertaken focusing on both quantitative and qualitative aspects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Service provision was found to be highly inequitable, with typically a 10-20-fold variation in referral and genetic testing rates between different UK regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Service levels per million population are much higher in London than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one of the regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The review concluded that capacity of services is inadequate to meet current or future demand and many services lack the critical mass to provide the full range of services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recommendations are made for the development of services appropriate for the future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Services should be led by cardiology but have close links with clinical genetics services, which should provide support with specialist genetics advice and cascade testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, the international relevance of this review is considered </plain></SENT>
