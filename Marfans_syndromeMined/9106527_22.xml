<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CCA has recently been shown to result from mutations in the FBN2 gene, which encodes an elastin-associated microfibrillar protein called fibrillin-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two siblings are reported here with classic manifestations of CCA with unaffected parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the FBN2 cDNA from dermal fibroblasts from one of the affected siblings revealed a heterozygous exon splicing error deleting nt 3722-3844 of the FBN2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This cDNA deletion resulted in selective removal of one of the 43 calcium-binding EGF-like domains of the fibrillin-2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the FBN2 gene in the affected siblings' DNA indicated that the splicing error resulted from an A-to-G transition 15 nt upstream from the 3' splice site of the intron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The genomic mutation resulting in the splicing error alters a putative branch point sequence important for lariat formation, an intermediate structure of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> splicing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mutation was detectable in DNA from the father's hair bulbs and buccal cells but not his white blood cell DNA, indicating that the father was a somatic mosaic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of transcript levels by use of dermal fibroblasts from the proband demonstrated that the FBN2 allele containing the exon deletion was expressed at a higher level than the allele inherited from the mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that FBN2 exon splicing errors are a cause of CCA, furthering the understanding of the molecular basis of this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, the demonstration of gonadal mosaicism in the FBN2 gene is important for accurate genetic counseling of families with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases of CCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, the preferential expression of the mutated FBN2 allele in dermal fibroblasts may have implications for understanding the pathogenesis and rarity of CCA </plain></SENT>
