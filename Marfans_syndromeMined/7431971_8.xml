<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty patients (97.5%) are long-term survivors who to date have had no complications related to the aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This series of patients included 10 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection of the aortic root and ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients undergoing elective operations for aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> included three with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004933'>ascending aortic dissection</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, three with previous operations on the aortic root, and six patients who had associated coronary artery bypass or mitral valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up to 8 years shows that patients with composite graft replacement have exhibited no early or late complications of this procedure </plain></SENT>
