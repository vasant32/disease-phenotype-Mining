<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 181 consecutive patients (mean age 53 years; 153 men) operated on between 1983 and 1993 were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indications for surgery were annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> (n=98), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (n = 46), other indications (n = 12), and various indications after previous aortic valve replacement (n = 25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 28 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The open-button technique was performed in 74 patients (41 %) and the Bentall inclusion technique in 107 patients (59%), with a Cabrol shunt to the right atrium in 16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall survival was 75% after 7 years, significantly decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (p = 0.0019) and without difference between the two surgical techniques (p = 0.3166) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reoperation-free survival was 69% at 7 years and significantly decreased after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection (p = 0.0421 ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pseudoaneurysm formation only occurred in 3 patients operated with the Bentall technique not including a Cabrol shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long-term results are satisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> survival is decreased and late reoperations more frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The open technique is safe in non-dissection and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection and avoids pseudoaneurysm formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The Bentall technique combined with Cabrol shunt is indicated if there is a high risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Long-term monitoring of the aorta is mandatory in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection and/or Marfan disease </plain></SENT>
