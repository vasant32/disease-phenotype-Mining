<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> in childhood and adolescence is made by the criteria of the Gent nosology, which evaluates genetic data, family history and a spectrum of clinical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to the age dependent manifestations of the clinical symptoms, combined with the extreme <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> diagnosis in early childhood remains sometimes difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Prospectively, we analyzed the clinical symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients where <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> was suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated those patients between January 1997 and April 2002 by an interdisciplinary approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared the clinical datas of the patients by using the Gent nosology and the Berlin nosolgy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 34 patients underwent full follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median age was 10,32 years with a range of 0,01 to 37,31 years, 19 patients were male, 15 patients were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In eight patients <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> could be rouled out, 9 of 26 patients (34,6 %) fullified the criteria of the Gent nosology, in 17 of 26 patients (65,4 %) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> remained just suspected, but was not fullified by the criteria of the Gent nosology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concerning the Berlin nosology 14 of 26 patients (53,8 %) fullified the criteria, 12 of 26 patients (46,2 %) failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Due to the criteria of the Gent nosology 14 patients (53,8 %) fullified the criteria of skeletal involvement, 21 patients (80,8 %) fullified cardiovascular major manifestation, 6 patients (23,1 %) had an ophthalmic major manifestation, and 9 patients (34,6 %) had an affected first degree relative or were genetically determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the data of our patients the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> in childhood and adolescence can be made more sensitive by the criteria of the Berlin nosology compared to the Gent nosology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This seems to be caused by the age dependent manifestations of the symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Until diagnostic algorhythms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> in childhood remain suboptimal, continuous clinical follow-up for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases even those only in the case of suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> are necessary to exclude complicated course and to improve outcome </plain></SENT>
