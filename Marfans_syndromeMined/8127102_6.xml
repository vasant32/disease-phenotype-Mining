<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine the results of mitral valve repair in these patients, we did a retrospective review of 160 patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who had cardiac surgical procedures between January 1983 and January 1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients had mitral procedures, 29 of which were repairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mitral valve replacement was necessary in seven patients because of extensive annular calcification and/or severe anterior leaflet abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 18 men and 11 women undergoing mitral valve repair had a mean age of 26.5 +/- 2.6 years (range 9 months to 54 years); seven patients were less than 18 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four of the 29 patients had concomitant aortic root replacement because of <z:mp ids='MP_0010574'>aortic dilation</z:mp> or valvular insufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 29 repairs included annuloplasty, and 11 patients also required leaflet resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At mean follow-up of 26.6 +/- 4.8 months, there have been three late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, two caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and one by complications of type III <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> survivors are in New York Heart Association class I or II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In three patients recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> developed (grade III or IV); 5-year actuarial freedom from significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> was 88.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient required repeat mitral annuloplasty after <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> of the composite aortic graft spread to the mitral valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No patient required late mitral valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that (1) 22% of patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who undergo cardiac operation require a mitral valve procedure, (2) most can be treated by mitral repair rather than replacement, and (3) at early follow-up, results of mitral repair in this population are satisfactory </plain></SENT>
