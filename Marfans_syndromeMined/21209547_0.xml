<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is characterised by inability to close the mouth with or without pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dislocation has to be differentiated from subluxation which is a self reducible condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dislocation can occur in any direction with anterior dislocation being the commonest one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Various predisposing factors have been associated with dislocation like <z:mp ids='MP_0003646'>muscle fatigue</z:mp> and spasm, the defect in the bony surface like shallow articular eminence, and laxity of the capsular ligament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>People with defect in collagen synthesis like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehler Danlos syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> are said to be genetically predisposed to this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Various treatment modalities have been used ranging from conservative techniques to surgical methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001373'>dislocations</z:hpo> can be reduced manually or with conservative approach and recurrent and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cases can be reduced by surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Though the dislocation in our case was 4 months a simple manual reduction proved to be successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We believe that manual reduction can be attempted as first line of treatment prior to surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
