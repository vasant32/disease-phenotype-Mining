<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LEARNING OBJECTIVE: At the conclusion of this learning activity, participants should be familiar with the embryology of the neural crest, specifically the development of melanocytes and the heart with its vessels, leading to shared abnormalities of the two systems; the major syndromes and associations producing both cutaneous changes, especially of the pigment systems, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001626'>cardiovascular abnormalities</z:hpo>; the role of the dermatologist in recognizing these changes; and the need to be cognizant and alert in helping screen for associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
