<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The multiorgan involvement and wide spectrum of associated phenotypes highlights the complex pathogenesis underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the genotype to phenotype correlations, we engineered four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> causing mutations into a fibrillin-1 fragment encoded by exons 18-25, a region known to interact with tropoelastin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biophysical and biochemical approaches, including small angle x-ray scattering, analytical ultracentrifugation, and circular dichroism, were used to study the impact of these mutations upon the structure and function of the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations G880S, C862R, and C908R, situated within the second hybrid domain, disrupted the ratio of alpha-helix to beta-sheet leading to a more compact conformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data clearly demonstrate the importance of the previously uncharacterized hybrid domain in fibrillin-1 structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, mutation K1023N situated within the linker region between the third eight cysteine motif and cbEGF 11 markedly extended the length of the fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, none of the mutations affected tropoelastin binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The profound effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four mutations on fragment conformation suggest that they contribute to the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> by disrupting protein folding and its assembly into fibrillin-rich microfibrils </plain></SENT>
