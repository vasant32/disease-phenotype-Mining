<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hospital mortality was 12% (6.5% over the past 5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At follow-up an average of 5.1 years later, 2 patients had postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>heart block</z:hpo>, and late complications required reoperation in 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was 8 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (overall mortality 25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival at 6 years was 77% and improvement was noted in the functional class of 32 (74%) of the 43 survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3 patients with abnormal preoperative ventricular function have continued in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo>; 3 have moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> and 2 have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Initially patients underwent surgery when their condition deteriorated despite medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic assessment of the aortic root has improved diagnosis and management; a large, progressively dilating aorta and evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> were indications for surgery in 11 symptom-free patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> are prone to other cardiovascular manifestation which affect survival, elective prophylactic surgery to the ascending aorta can be done with a low mortality and expectation of improved lifespan </plain></SENT>
