<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two immature patients with the syndrome's skeletal expressions predominating were studied for deep acetabuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Half of these individuals (26 patients) had true <z:hpo ids='HP_0003179'>protrusio acetabuli</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
