<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although minimally invasive surgical procedures have aroused much interest in cardiac surgery, difficulty still exists with its application in most of the operations on great arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report summarizes our initial experience of aortic root replacement by a superior ministernotomy in terms of operative indications, operative techniques, and potential benefits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between July 1999 and September 1999, 8 patients who were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic valve regurgitation</z:hpo> underwent aortic root replacements with composite grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical characteristics, in-hospital outcomes, and postoperative stay of these patients were compared with data of patients who had undergone Bentall procedure by standard median sternotomy from January to September 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in either group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Demographics were similar between the two groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the mini-incision group, the mediastinal drainage was significantly less than the standard incision group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean operating time was significantly longer than that in the standard incision group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cardiopulmonary bypass time and aortic cross-clamping time were similar in both groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean intubation time, postoperative blood transfusion amount, duration of intensive care unit stay and postoperative hospital stay were less than that of the standard incision group; however, they <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> showed no statistical significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aortic root replacement by a superior ministernotomy in cardiopulmonary bypass with cannulas through the femoral artery and femoral vein or right atrium is a safe, reliable procedure with excellent exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The procedure provides a potential benefit of less trauma, quick recovery, and reduction of mediastinal drainage and reduction of blood transfusion </plain></SENT>
