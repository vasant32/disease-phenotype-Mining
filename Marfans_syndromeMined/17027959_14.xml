<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fibrillins are also expressed in embryos, but no early developmental role has been described for these proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We use three independent methods to reveal a role for Xenopus fibrillin (XF) at gastrulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First, expressing truncated forms of XF in the embryo leads to failure of gastrulation concomitant with a dominant-negative effect on native fibrillin fibril assembly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expressing truncated XF also inhibits <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> progression of the patterned, polarized cell motility that drives convergence and extension at gastrulation and perturbs directed extension in cultured explants of dorsal mesoderm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Second, injection of a synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> encoding a cell-binding domain of XF into midgastrula embryos causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> failure of gastrulation associated with defective fibrillin fibril assembly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These injections also reveal a critical role for this <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> in the fibril assembly process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Third, morpholino-mediated knockdown of translation of XF in the embryo also perturbs <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastrulation and directed extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together, these data show that native Xenopus fibrillin is essential for the process of directed convergent extension in presumptive notochord at gastrulation </plain></SENT>
