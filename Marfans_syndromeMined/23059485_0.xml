<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: Medical records of 159 eyes of 80 subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1562061" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microspherophakia</z:e> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical features at presentation, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo>, methods of treatment, and their outcomes were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>Glaucoma</z:hpo> was diagnosed based on intraocular pressure (IOP)≥22 mm Hg on 2 different occasions and/or glaucomatous optic disc damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angle closure was defined as occludable angles &gt;270 degrees with or without presence of peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0011481'>anterior synechiae</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>Glaucoma</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 81 eyes (51%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age of subjects was 20±13 years, mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">refractive error</z:e> was -13.5±5.5, the mean IOP was 27.7±11.1 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IOP≥22 mm Hg was present in 84% of eyes, disc damage in 59% of the eyes, 75% eyes had angle closure, and 25% had open angle on gonioscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subluxation of crystalline lens was seen in 53 eyes and 14 eyes had dislocation of the lens; systemic associations were present in 21 subjects (3 Marfan syndrome, 18 Weill-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265313" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Marchesani syndrome</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nine eyes out of 51 and 2 out of 16 eyes responded to medical treatment and laser iridotomy, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 48 eyes that required surgical intervention, 24 eyes underwent trabeculectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complete success probability of trabeculectomy was 86% [95% confidence interval (CI), 63%-95%] at 6 months, 77% (95% CI, 53%-90%) at 1 year, which was maintained till 7 years, and reduced to 61% (95%CI, 26%-84%) at 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nearly 20% of eyes at presentation and 30% of the eyes at last follow-up were blind due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: More than half of the eyes with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1562061" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microspherophakia</z:e> in this series presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo>; angle closure was the predominant form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
