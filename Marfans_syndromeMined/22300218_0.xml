<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Locus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> has also been reported and confirmed, with mutations in the receptor genes TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 identified in association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>-related phenotypes </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that dysregulation of TGFBR3-associated TGF-ß signaling is implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> or related phenotype pathogenesis, we selected a cohort of 49 patients, fulfilling or nearly fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were known not to carry a mutation in the FBN1 gene (including three 5' upstream alternatively spliced exons), the TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutation screening for the TGFBR3 gene in these patients and in controls led to the identification of a total of ten exonic (one novel), four intronic (one novel) and one 3'UTR variant in the TGFBR3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that variations in TGFBR3 gene appear not to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> or related phenotype </plain></SENT>
