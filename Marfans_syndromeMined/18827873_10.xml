<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is clinically classified into types 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LDS type 1 can be recognised by craniofacial characteristics, e.g. <z:hpo ids='HP_0000316'>hypertelorism</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000193'>bifid uvula</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo>, whereas these are absent in LDS type 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is important to recognise LDS because its vascular pathology is aggressive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We describe nine LDS patients from four families, relate their features to published cases, and discuss important aspects of the diagnosis and management of LDS in order to make clinicians aware of this new syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Characteristics found in the majority of these LDS patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> and/or a bifid/abnormal uvula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Because <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and rupture in LDS tend to occur at a young age or at aortic root diameters not considered at risk in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, and because the vascular pathology can be seen throughout the entire arterial tree, patients should be carefully followed up and aggressive surgical treatment is mandatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinicians must therefore be aware of LDS as a cause of aggressive aortic pathology and that its distinguishing features can sometimes be easily recognised </plain></SENT>
