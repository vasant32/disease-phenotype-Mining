<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We examined the prevalence of known facial features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>)-dolicocephaly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000272'>malar hypoplasia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000663'>enophthalmos</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000278'>retrognathia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000494'>down-slanting palpebral fissures</z:hpo>-and the diagnostic utility (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, predictive values, and likelihood ratios) of using them for screening and diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Frontal and lateral photographs of 76 subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> (average age 18.3 years) and of 76 age- and gender-matched controls were obtained, randomized, and compiled into an online survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three physicians experienced with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> rated each photograph for the presence of each feature and indicated whether each photograph triggered a suspicion for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight non-expert orthopaedic surgeons reviewed a subset of those photographs and indicated if each triggered a suspicion for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Half of the non-experts then received a brief diagnosis instructional sheet, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> non-experts were retested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results were compared using Chi-square tests and t-tests with a significance level of P &lt; 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using facial features alone, the accuracy of experienced physicians in identifying individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> was 73% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Facial features had a 54% sensitivity, a 91% specificity, an 86% positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>), a 67% negative predictive value (NPV), a 6.9% positive likelihood ratio (PLR), and a 50% negative likelihood ratio (NLR) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the diagnostic accuracy between non-experts receiving and not receiving instructions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Facial features are more specific than sensitive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the recognition of facial features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> can be used as an initial screening tool, but facial features do not have a high sensitivity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
