<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>Aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> is currently detected by nomograms based on M-mode echocardiographic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aortic root diameters measured by 2-dimensional echocardiography at the anulus, sinuses of Valsalva, supra-aortic ridge and proximal ascending aorta in 135 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adults and 52 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children were compared with age, gender, body habitus, blood pressure and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume, and with M-mode findings and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional measurements at the sinuses of Valsalva were larger than M-mode aortic root values (p less than 0.001), and use of 2-dimensional values with M-mode nomograms falsely diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> in 40% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children and 19% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional measurements at the sinuses closely correlated with body surface area in children (r = 0.93, p less than 0.0005), moderately in adults younger than 40 years of age (r = 0.71, p less than 0.0005) and weakly in older adults (r = 0.40, p less than 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In adults, gender influenced aortic root size at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> levels (p less than 0.001), but dimensions were similar when indexed for body surface area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age strongly influenced supraaortic ridge and ascending aortic diameters; blood pressure and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume had no independent effect on aortic size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, (1) 2-dimensional echocardiographic aortic root dimensions are influenced by age and body size but not by blood pressure; (2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> is overdiagnosed when aortic diameter at the sinuses of Valsalva is compared with M-mode nomograms; (3) nomograms comparing aortic diameter with body surface area should be used in children; and (4) although use of nomograms based on body size in adults should maximize sensitivity for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo>, 98% specificity is attained by use of an upper <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limit of 2.1 cm/m2 for aortic diameter at the sinuses of Valsalva in both men and women </plain></SENT>
