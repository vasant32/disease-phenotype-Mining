<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The similarities between the human and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007453" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bovine diseases</z:e> suggest that similar metabolic defects could be responsible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although indirect immunofluorescent assays for fibrillin in skin biopsies did not distinguish affected cattle from control animals, cultures of skin fibroblasts of affected animals were distinguished from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, unrelated control animals and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> half-siblings on the basis of fibrillin staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 72 to 96 hours in culture, stained with anti-fibrillin monoclonal antibody 201, hyperconfluent fibroblast cultures of affected cattle had less immunoreactive fibrillin than control cultures, and the staining pattern was granular rather than fibrillar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Under similar culture conditions, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bovine aortic smooth muscle cells produced large amounts of immunoreactive fibrillin, but smooth muscle cells from a single affected cow showed markedly less fibrillin staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In pulse-chase metabolic labeling experiments with [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>]cysteine, dermal fibroblasts from 6 affected calves, incorporated far less fibrillin into the extracellular matrix than control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings are similar to those reported in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and they suggest that the bovine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, like the human disorder, is caused by a mutation in fibrillin, leading to defective microfibrillar synthesis </plain></SENT>
