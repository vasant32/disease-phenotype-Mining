<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CHD patients with no known <z:hpo ids='HP_0001693'>cardiac shunts</z:hpo> (CHD-NKS), based on their echocardiographic or angiographic procedures, were tested for a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> using agitated saline contrast transcranial Doppler (TCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Medical records of 2,920 patients from the UCLA Adult CHD Center were screened to participate in a study to evaluate the prevalence of MH in adults with CHD; 182 patients (6.23%) had CHD-NKS; of these, 60 (30%) underwent a TCD; 23 (38%) tested positive and 37 (62%) tested negative for a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> (P = 0.01 compared with controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of MH was 43% in CHD-NKS compared with 11% in controls (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TCD demonstrated right-to-left shunting in approximately 2/3 of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001642'>pulmonary stenosis</z:hpo>, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and congenitally corrected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001669'>transposition of great vessels</z:hpo>, 1/4 of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo>, 1/5 of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010316'>Ebstein's anomaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Approximately half of these experienced MH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients who had MH did not show a higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> when compared with patients without MH (P = 0.57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, CHD patients with conditions usually not associated with a shunt have a higher than expected prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> which permits intermittent right-to-left shunting undetected by standard non-contrast TTE and TEE; the increased prevalence of right-to-left shunting may partially explain the higher than expected frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraines</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
