<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> is frequently associated with valve's pathology, rupture and dissection are two serious events that might occur; are linked with high mortality and are closely connected to aortic diameter and to wall's pathology, so that the elective indication is essential and it basically depends on those two factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are different technical alternatives, anatomical and functional, of the aortic root, the procedure's election is most specially based on patient's age, on pathological substract, on anticoagulation risk, and on possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We wish to report our experience performed from 1990 onto 2004 with 364 cases of aortic root surgery, of which 312 were elective interventions and 52 were emergencies, with a mortality of 4.8% and 19.2% respectively, and a global mortality of 6.8% using the different procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The choice of procedure is a multifactorial decision and it is necessary try offering the patient, the most idoneus individualized solution, according to personal characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The different surgical techniques (valved conduits, remodelling procedures, biological grafts, etc.) can be carried out with low figures of morbid-mortality and excellent long term outcomes </plain></SENT>
