<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> during pregnancy can be fatal to both the mother and the fetus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of the present study was to characterize the prevalence, treatment and outcomes of this dangerous condition in an effort to determine optimal management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted using data from four Marfan patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> during pregnancy at our institution between 1991 and 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean gestational period at the time of operative repair was 31 weeks, with a range of 26-34 weeks, and the aortic root diameter ranged from 35 to 85 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two of the four patients underwent a combined operation with cesarean section followed by aortic repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient underwent operative aortic repair following spontaneous delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The final patient underwent aortic repair with the fetus remaining in situ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median sternotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass were established via the femoral artery with direct right atria drainage and left atrial venting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Composite graft replacement combined with re-implantation of the coronary artery and aortic valve replacement were performed in three patients, and aortic valve replacement with coronary artery bypass grafting of the right coronary artery was performed in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three of four patients underwent aortic arch repair utilizing antegrade cerebral perfusion and deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> with total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient that underwent operative correction with the fetus remaining in situ experienced fetal demise with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> just after cardiac surgery, and the patient died 4 days later secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> and multi-organ failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The remaining three cases recovered uneventfully, and the mothers and babies were discharged in good condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on these data, we advocate cesarean section with concomitant aortic repair for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Minimization of deep hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> time is also recommended for cases in which the fetus remains in situ </plain></SENT>
