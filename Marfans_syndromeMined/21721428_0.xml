<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Standard aortic root dimensional measurement by the two dimensional echocardiography should be routinely performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is limited data on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> reference on Thai population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Aims of this study were (1) to determine the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> reference of aortic root dimension in Thai population and (2) to determine the difference in the aortic root size in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> comparing with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: We retrospectively reviewed 81 patients who had the transthoracic echocardiographic examinations in our echocardiographic lab and had the aortic root measurement data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> and/or regurgitation more than mild in degree, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The echocardiographic data of were collected; the aortic root dimensions at four levels; aortic valve annulus, sinus of Valsava, sinotubular junction and tubular parts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was indentified if the patient had the prior diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medications, or who had blood pressure more than 140/90 mmHg for two or more occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-one patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixty patients (74.1%) were diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 66.9 +/- 11.2 years in hypertensive patients and 49.1 +/- 16.4 years in normotensive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> reference values based on 95% upper <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limit of aortic valve annulus, sinus of Valsava, sinotubular junction and tubular part were 2.30 (2.21-2.38), 3.56 (3.35-3.77), 2.79 (2.61-2.97), and 3.36 (3.13-3.59), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> had significant larger sinus of Valsava and tubular part of aortic root than patients with normotension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We reported a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> reference value for aortic root size in Thai population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The aortic root sizes are influenced by hypertensive status, age and gender </plain></SENT>
