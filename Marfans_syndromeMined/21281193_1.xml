<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SAMPLE POPULATION: 12 mitral valve leaflets collected from cadavers of 5 clinically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> dogs and from 7 dogs with CMVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURES: Expression of TGF-β isoforms 1, 2, and 3; MMPs 1, 2, 3, and 9; TGF-β receptor II (TβR-II); and α smooth muscle actin (αSMA) in mitral valves of dogs with CMVD was compared with that in mitral valves from clinically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, responses of valvular interstitial cells (VICs) to TGF-β3, MMP-3, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor</z:chebi> (ACEI) as a suppressor of TGF-β3 were examined in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Expression of TGF-β3, TβR-II, αSMA, and MMP-3 was only detected in mitral valves of dogs with CMVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of αSMA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> in cultured VICs were significantly increased following incubation with TGF-β3; treatment with MMP-3 resulted in increased amounts of active and total TGF-β3, and total TGF-β3 in VICs was significantly decreased by incubation with ACEI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Findings suggested that increased TGF-β3 and MMP-3 contribute to the pathogenesis of valvular degeneration associated with CMVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, it is possible that the use of ACEI could effectively block pathological alterations in VICs associated with CMVD in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Impact on Human Medicine-CMVD is associated with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results of the study reported here will help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of CMVD in dogs and humans </plain></SENT>
