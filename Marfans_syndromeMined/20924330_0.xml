<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Marfan patients with thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAAs</z:chebi>) or with thoracoabdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> (TAAAs) should be treated by means of open surgery, requiring an extensive protocol, including extracorporeal circulation, neuromonitoring and adjunctive modalities to provide organ protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then, open surgical repair of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi>(A)s are associated with excellent results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in the last time a gradual change to endovascular treatment in Marfan patients is observable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Particularly in patients with an increased surgical risk due to redo sternotomy or thoracotomy, endovascular treatment might be an alternative due to its less invasive approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consequently, thoracic endovascular aortic repair comprises a therapeutic alternative in individual situations even in Marfan patients, when the landing zones are safe and appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In cases of failed endovascular therapy, however, conversion to open surgery remains still an option with acceptable results, although the distal and proximal clamping positions change inappropriate with larger extensions due to the aortic stent </plain></SENT>
