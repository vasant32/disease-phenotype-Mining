<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the mechanism of generation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> (MVP) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, we studied the relations of the length of the anterior mitral leaflet to the diameter of the mitral ring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 13 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> associated with MVP (Group I), 21 of isolated MVP (Group II), and 24 controls free from valvular disease (Group C), the maximal length of the anterior mitral leaflet (L) and the end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters of the mitral ring (Rd and Rs) were measured in the long-axis views on two-dimensional echocardiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the measurements were corrected with the body surface area; designated as L(c), Rd(c) and Rs(c), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, L/Rd and L/Rs, and the percentage of shortening of the mitral ring in systole, (Rd-Rs)/Rd X 100, were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The body surface area in Group I was greater than that in Group II (p less than 0.05), but there was no significant difference between Groups II and C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The L was obviously different between Groups I and II or C (p less than 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there was a significant difference in L(c) between Groups I and II (p less than 0.02) or C (p less than 0.001), indicating the remarkably long anterior mitral leaflet in Group I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Rd in Group I and II was greater than that in Group C (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.02, respectively), while there was no significant difference in the Rd(c) among the 3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was also no statistical difference in either Rs or Rs(c) among the 3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both L/Rd and L/Rs in Group I were remarkably higher than those in Groups II and C (p less than 0.001, respectively), whereas these parameter did not differentiate Group II from Group C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(Rd-Rs)/Rd X 100 was higher in Group I than that in Groups II and C (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, respectively), but it was not significantly different between Groups II and C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that one of the probable mechanisms of generation of MVP in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> is the redundant mitral valve resulting from a remarkably long leaflet and increased systolic shortening of the enlarged mitral ring </plain></SENT>
