<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> and fibromyxomatous thickening of the mitral leaflets have long been recognized as such, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> has only recently been added as one of the pleiotropic features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, and natural history of mitral valve dysfunction in this condition are uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in one clinic who met strict diagnostic criteria for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and who had clinical and echocardiographic examinations before age 22 years were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 166 patients (84 males, aged 11.9 +/- 0.6 years [mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>]; and 82 females, 11.0 +/- 0.6 years), 52 percent had auscultatory and 68 percent had echocardiographic evidence of mitral valve dysfunction, generally <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prevalence did not differ between the sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up in 115 patients averaged five examinations over a mean of four years; 17 percent were followed for more than six years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Criteria for progression of mitral valve dysfunction were: (1) on auscultation, the appearance of new systolic clicks or apical systolic murmurs, a mitral regurgitant murmur increased by two grades, or appearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> not due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>; and (2) on echocardiography, the new appearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> or abnormally increased left atrial dimension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nearly half the patients met at least one criterion and one quarter had both auscultatory and echocardiographic evidence of progressive mitral valve dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twice as many females demonstrated worse mitral valve function with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 166 patients either died as a result of mitral valve dysfunction or required mitral valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> developed in an additional 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Rupture of chordae tendineae was uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Antibiotic prophylaxis was routine, and no cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006689'>bacterial endocarditis</z:hpo> of the mitral valve occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that mitral valve dysfunction is extremely common in young patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and usually presents as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> develops in one of every eight patients by the third decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thus, the prevalence and natural history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> appear distinct from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> associated with other conditions, including idiopathic or familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
