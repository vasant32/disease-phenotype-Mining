<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 genes are responsible for the phenotypical manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and congenital contractural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo> respectively, which emphasizes their essential roles in developmental processes of various tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this last notion, organ culture experiments have indirectly suggested morphogenic roles for fibrillins in lung and kidney development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to contribute to the understanding of the roles of fibrillins in developmental and morphogenetic events, we have investigated the distribution of fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 in human embryonic and early fetal tissues between the 5th and the 12th gestational week, i.e. at the beginning of organogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 were localized immunohistochemically using specific monoclonal antibodies, mAb 69 and mAb 48, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both fibrillins are widely distributed in various human anlagen, from early developmental stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In most embryonic and early fetal human organs such as skin, lung, heart, aorta, central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system anlage, nerves, and ganglia, fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 follow the same temporo-spatial pattern of distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in other organs such as kidney, liver, rib anlagen, notochord fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 are distributed differentially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present paper is focused on this aspect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest different roles for fibrillin-1 and -2 in the development of these structures </plain></SENT>
