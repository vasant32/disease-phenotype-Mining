<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two types of bullae are opposed : <z:mp ids='MP_0008854'>bulla</z:mp> found in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> parenchyma and <z:mp ids='MP_0008854'>bulla</z:mp> associated with widespread emphysematous lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The biochemical and biological mechanisms of the emphysematous changes are briefly described, with a distinction of two different pathogenesis : on one hand, an inherited defect in connective tissue synthesis as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and on the other hand, an unbalance between proteases and antiproteases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pathologist's contribution to the classification of the surgical forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002097'>emphysema</z:hpo> is documented by an electron microscopic study of lung biopsy in some cases : two cases with bullae (a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and an alpha 1 AT deficiency of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> Z phenotype) with diffuse panlobular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002097'>emphysema</z:hpo>; and 4 cases of bullae without radiological evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002097'>emphysema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The elastic fibres were modified only in the 2 first cases but were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A follow up of such cases is needed </plain></SENT>
