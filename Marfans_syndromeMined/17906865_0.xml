<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> syndrome was suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematomas</z:hpo> were found on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and spinal MRI showed large lumbosacral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0078981" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">arachnoid diverticula</z:e>; no cerebrospinal fluid leaks could be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite bed rest and hydration for 2 weeks, postural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> remained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Epidural blood patching was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the patient became asymptomatic and could stand up after 1 day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI did not find recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> after 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>Dural ectasia</z:hpo> is one of the major criteria of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and it is often poorly symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> is a rare complication especially in children, and management is not standardized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this case report, blood patching was sufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further research into the diagnosis and management of spontaneous intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> is required </plain></SENT>
