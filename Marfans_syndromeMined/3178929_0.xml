<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Less is known, however, about the state of the amorphous components of the aortic connective tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the course of a study of transmural transport in blood vessels, we have had the opportunity to study dystrophic aorta from two young men who survived elective surgery; both with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> (AI) histologically compatible with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One had recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (RCDA) as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aorta of the first (but not the second) was histologically compatible with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fresh specimens of intact ascending aorta were incubated in Krebs solution, pH 7.4, containing 125I-labelled bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 37 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The samples were then frozen, and serially sectioned in the plane of the lumenal surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The radioactivity of the 20-micron thick sections was then determined, and expressed as a tissue/labelled solution concentration ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transmural profiles of these ratios revealed no difference between the aorta of the RCDA patient with non-specific aortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath>, and that of a 70-year-old man undergoing aortocoronary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, in the patient with aortic histology compatible with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, the average media concentration ratio was 5-fold less (4% vs. 20%) </plain></SENT>
