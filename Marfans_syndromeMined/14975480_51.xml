<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to better characterize the young patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (AoD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic dissection</z:hpo> is unusual in young patients, and frequently associated with unusual presentations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were collected on 951 patients diagnosed with AoD between January 1996 and November 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two categories of patients, &lt;40 years and &gt;or=40 years, were compared using chi-square cross tabulations for categorical and Student t test for continuous data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients (7%) with AoD were &lt;40 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients &gt;or=40 years, younger patients were less likely to have a prior history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05); however, younger patients were more likely to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo>, and prior aortic surgery (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical presentations in the two age groups were similar; however, younger patients were less likely to be hypertensive (25% vs. 45%, p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proximal aortas of young AoD patients were larger (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, p &lt; 0.05) compared with older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These differences in aortic size between age groups were not entirely related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mortality among young patients was similar to patients &gt;or=40 years of age (22% vs. 24%, p = NS), irrespective of the site of dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with older patients with AoD, young patients have unique risk factors for dissection: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valves</z:hpo>, and larger aortic dimensions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the mortality risk for young AoD patients is not lower than older AoD patients </plain></SENT>
