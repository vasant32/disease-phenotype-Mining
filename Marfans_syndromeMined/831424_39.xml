<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In previous investigation of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aging aorta, the claimed specificity of alterations in the media in the pathogenesis of dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the aorta was challenged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The concept was promoted that these changes are nonspecific and caused by general hemodynamic events within the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this investigation the aortic media was studied in patients with a <z:mp ids='MP_0010470'>dilated ascending aorta</z:mp>, whose hemodynamic profile is known to be altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with data obtained from the study of aortas with complete or incomplete dissection and aortas from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, a condition known to predispose to dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only quantitative differences were found between the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> "aging" aorta and the overtly abnormal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of dissected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, therefore, is considered to be initiated by processes if injury and repair within the aortic wall, consequent to hemodynamic forces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The histologic features of the media previously implicated as the specific underlying defect appear to represent the morphologic substrate of this traumatizing and reparative process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This process may gradually lead to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the aorta and, according to Laplace's law, a vicious cycle may ensue that may lead to further complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Local circumstances determine whether a dilated aorta will rupture or whether an incomplete or complete dissection will occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The fact that the aorta in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> shows basically the same structural alterations supports the concept proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> in these patients will lead to complications at an earlier age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> therefore is part of a spectrum of lesions that have as a common denominator the process of injury and repair </plain></SENT>
