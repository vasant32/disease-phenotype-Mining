<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Other mutations are frameshift, splice and nonsense mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are only a few reports of patients with marfanoid features and a molecularly proven complete deletion of a FBN1 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe the clinical features of 10 patients with a complete FBN1 gene deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven patients fulfilled the Ghent criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other three patients were examined at a young age and did not (yet) present the full clinical picture of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>Ectopia lentis</z:hpo> was present in at least two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>Aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> was present in 6 of the 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In three patients, the aortic root diameter was on the 95th percentile and in one patient, the diameter of the aortic root was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, the cross-section, however, had a cloverleaf appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients underwent aortic root surgery at a relatively young age (27 and 34 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>Mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> was present in 4 of the 10 patients, and billowing of the mitral valve in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had facial and skeletal features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients with a large deletion extending beyond the FBN1 gene had an extended phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that complete loss of one FBN1 allele does not predict a mild phenotype, and these findings support the hypothesis that true haploinsufficiency can lead to the classical phenotype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
