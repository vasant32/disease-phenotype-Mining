<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate the molecular and clinical spectrum of TGFBR2 mutations we screened the gene in 457 probands suspected of being affected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> or related disorders that had been referred to our laboratory for molecular diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified and report 23 mutations and 20 polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, we screened the TGFBR1 gene in the first 74 patients for whom no defect had been found, and identified 6 novel mutations and 12 polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutation-carrying probands displayed at referral a large clinical spectrum ranging from the Loeys-Dietz syndrome and neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> to isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a TGFBR1 gene mutation was found in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1321551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome</z:e> patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, we observed that the yield of mutation detection within the two genes was very low : 4.8% for classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, 4.6% for incomplete <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and 1% for TAAD in the TGFBR2 gene; 6.2%, 6.2% and 7% respectively in the TGFBR1 gene; in contrast to LDS, where the yield was exceptionally high (87.5%) </plain></SENT>
