<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The previously reported 64 cases were reviewed and the salient findings in 22 additional cases were discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The age at diagnosis in our 9 cases ranged from birth to 12 months (mean 2.7 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>Mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> was demonstrated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> in 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001704'>Tricuspid valve prolapse</z:hpo> was present in 8, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005180'>tricuspid regurgitation</z:hpo> in 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, and was progressive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aortic root assumed a "clover leaf" appearance in the parasternal short-axis view </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>Aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> was documented initially in 1 patient, and developed during follow-up in 4 of 7 infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dilation of the pulmonary arterial root and <z:mp ids='MP_0006048'>pulmonary regurgitation</z:mp> were found in 3 of 7 infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> associated with mitral or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005180'>tricuspid regurgitation</z:hpo> was present in 7 of the 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four infants died during the first year of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The salient pathologic features were myxomatous thickening and redundancy of the mitral and tricuspid leaflets, marked elongation of chordae tendineae and prominent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the aortic and pulmonary roots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Histologically, the collagen and elastic fibers were severely disrupted, disarrayed and fragmented with increased interstitial ground substance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data document that infantile <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is characterized by clinical and morphologic features that are distinctly different from the classic syndrome seen in adolescents and adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The aforementioned findings should facilitate early clinical and echocardiographic diagnosis of infantile <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
