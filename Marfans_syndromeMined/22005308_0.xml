<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Molecular study to identify mutations in the FBN1 gene can establish a definitive diagnosis even with atypical or «incomplete» phenotypes and enable earlier diagnosis in asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present work was to evaluate the frequency and type of FBN1 gene mutations in a population of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> patients referred to a tertiary care center with cardiothoracic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our sample included 30 individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> (from 14 families), evaluated in cardiology, rheumatology and ophthalmology consultations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, DNA was extracted from a peripheral blood sample and mutation screening of the entire coding sequence of the FBN1 gene was then performed, using the polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 12 different mutations in the 14 families studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, only two had been previously described in the literature, while the other 10 were found to be new mutations; 36% of patients carried a missense mutation and 50% carried a mutation leading to a premature termination codon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge this is the first genotypic description of Portuguese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this study, we highlight the need for comprehensive clinical evaluation of these patients and the value of FBN1 mutation analysis in selected cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By describing 10 new mutations, we have also helped broaden the spectrum of known FBN1 mutations associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
