<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>Ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> disease (AAAD) shows a low frequency, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> behavior, high risk of rupture, dissection and mortality, making elective surgery necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several procedures have been developed, and the Bentall technique is considered as the reference standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective was to describe the hospital mortality of AAAD surgically treated using the Bentall procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We carried out a descriptive study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Included were 23 patients with AAAD who were operated on between March 1, 2005 and September 30, 2008 at our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were obtained from clinical files, and descriptive statistics were selected for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study population was comprised of 23 patients with an average age of 46 years; 83% were males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Etiology was nonspecific degeneration of the middle layer with valve implication in 43%, bivalve aorta in 22%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Turner's syndrome</z:e> and poststenotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> each represented 9%, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu</z:e> disease and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ankylosing spondylitis</z:e> 4% each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> was reported in six (26%) patients as follows: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001680'>aortic coarctation</z:hpo> (2), ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopathy</z:e> (1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> (1), severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral insufficiency</z:hpo> (1) and subaortic membrane (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Procedures carried out were Bentall surgery in 20 (87%) patients and aortoplasty with valve prosthesis in three (13%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complications reported were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001892'>abnormal bleeding</z:hpo> with mediastinal exploration (17%), nosocomial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> (13%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (13%), and septic shock (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mortality was reported in three (13%) patients due to septic shock and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Surgical mortality with the Bentall procedure is similar to published results by other specialized centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Events related to the basic aortic pathology, surgical technique, aortic valve prosthesis and left ventricular dysfunction encourage longterm studies with follow-up </plain></SENT>
