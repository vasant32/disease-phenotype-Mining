<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bentall operations combined with total arch replacement and stented elephant trunk implantation were performed by using deep hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> and antegrade selective cerebral perfusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Urgent surgery underwent in 9 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean interval between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and the accomplishment of surgery was (41.0 +/- 15.9) hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cardiopulmonary bypass time was (191 +/- 26) min, average cross clamp time was (134 +/- 31) min, and average deep hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> time was (50.0 +/- 14.5) min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient died in hospital </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental disorder</z:e> in 6 cases, hemi-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> in 1 case, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> in 1 case, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> of anastomosis in 1 case, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> of alimentary tract in 1 case, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusion</z:hpo> in 4 cases were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Eleven cases were followed-up for 8 weeks to 36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There were no bending of the stents and no obstruction in the vascular prosthesis.No re-operation was needed </plain></SENT>
