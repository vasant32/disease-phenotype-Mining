<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Proper assembly mechanisms are central to the formation and function of these microfibrils, and their properties are often compromised in pathological circumstances such as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and in other fibrillinopathies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we have used human dermal fibroblasts to analyze the assembly of fibrillin-1 in dependence of other matrix-forming proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>siRNA knockdown experiments demonstrated that the assembly of fibrillin-1 is strictly dependent on the presence of extracellular fibronectin fibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunolabeling performed at the light and electron microscopic level showed colocalization of fibrillin-1 with fibronectin fibrils at the early stages of the assembly process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Protein-binding assays demonstrated interactions of fibronectin with a C-terminal region of fibrillin-1, -2, and -3 and with an N-terminal region of fibrillin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The C-terminal half of fibrillin-2 and -3 had propensities to multimerize, as has been previously shown for fibrillin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The C-terminal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three fibrillins interacted strongly with fibronectin as multimers, but not as monomers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mapping studies revealed that the major binding interaction between fibrillins and fibronectin involves the collagen/gelatin-binding region between domains FNI(6) and FNI(9) </plain></SENT>
