<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report on a 46-year-old man with a 4-year history of predominantly nocturnal pain at the thoracic and lumbar spine as well as accompanying morning stiffness and episodes of alternating buttock pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At physical examination the patient presented with the typical traits for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>), along with limitation of both chest expansion and movement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> planes of the lumbar spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pelvic and lumbar spine radiographs showed findings consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ankylosing spondylitis</z:e> (AS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Laboratory tests were consistent with an inflammatory state and HLA typing was positive for the B27 antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transthoracic echocardiography showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> of the posterior mitral leaflet and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We diagnosed co-existent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association of these two pathologies is particularly interesting, owing to the co-existence of hypermobility of peripheral joints due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> ligamentous hyperlaxity, and the reduction of both axial skeleton motility and chest expansion related to AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As both of these diseases may damage the cardiovascular system over time, follow-up with echocardiography monitoring is indispensable </plain></SENT>
