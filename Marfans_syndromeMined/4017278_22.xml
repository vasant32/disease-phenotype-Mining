<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report here four families with congenital contractural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo> (CCA) in which a wide range of phenotypic expression is observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In one family with a large number of affected individuals the condition is mildly expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These individuals usually have <z:hpo ids='HP_0009901'>crumpled ears</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003807'>camptodactyly</z:mp> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0231679" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ulnar deviation of the fingers</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001181'>adducted thumbs</z:hpo>, limited elbow and/or knee extension, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> of the calf muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>Arachnodactyly</z:hpo> is not a constant feature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0008443'>spinal deformities</z:hpo> are present and only the proband has <z:hpo ids='HP_0001762'>clubfoot</z:hpo> deformities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With time, affecteds have experienced spontaneous improvement of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo> and their condition in adulthood has not interfered with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lifestyle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within this family there is little phenotypic variation between affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those affected within each of the other families have had varying degrees of severity of the condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A review of 29 other kindreds described in the literature with congenital contractural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo> shows that in this condition the most common features are abnormally formed ears, <z:mp ids='MP_0003807'>camptodactyly</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001181'>adducted thumbs</z:hpo>, limited movement of the elbows and knees, and underdevelopment of the calf muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous improvement of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo> with age is reported in 94% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>Kyphosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002751'>kyphoscoliosis</z:hpo> occurred in 50% and these defects were present in those who where more severely affected with CCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No ocular problems have been reported in this syndrome, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart defects</z:hpo> have occurred in 14.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is the most important condition to differentiate from congenital contractural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo> since these two conditions are similar phenotypically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, in the former there are frequently serious ocular and cardiovascular problems which lead to significant morbidity and/or early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
