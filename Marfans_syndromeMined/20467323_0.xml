<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To create a practical desk reference for clinicians focused on the differential diagnosis of individuals presenting with features that suggest an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inherited disorder of connective tissue</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched the medical literature for distinct clinical entities that shared clinical features with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and other classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inherited disorders of connective tissue</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-six distinct <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heritable disorders</z:e> of connective tissue were identified that have overlapping features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These disorders were organized into two matrices according to clinical characteristics and according to causative genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A broad differential diagnosis is emerging for individuals presenting with features suggestive of altered connective tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recent advances in molecular genetics have aided in the delineation of these disorders </plain></SENT>
