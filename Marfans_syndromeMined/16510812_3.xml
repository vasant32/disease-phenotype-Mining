<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003179'>Protrusio acetabuli</z:hpo> is known to occur in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, but its prevalence, its effects on hip function, and its possible association with the subsequent development of degenerative hip disease have not been studied in a large population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, some clinicians have recommended prophylactic hip surgery for preadolescents with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003179'>protrusio acetabuli</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of 173 patients (346 hips) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who were interviewed and examined for calculation of the Iowa hip score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anteroposterior radiographs of the pelvis were made, and two radiographic indices of acetabular depth were measured: (1) the center-edge angle of Wiberg and (2) the acetabular-ilioischial distance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of protrusio was defined with use of two extant definitions: (1) a center-edge angle of &gt;50 degrees or (2) an acetabular-ilioischial distance of &gt;/=3 mm in male patients or &gt;/=6 mm in female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analyses were performed between these radiographic indices of acetabular depth and patient age, Iowa hip scores, the magnitude of the radiographic joint space, and range of motion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003179'>protrusio acetabuli</z:hpo> was 27% according to the center-edge angle criterion and 16% according to the acetabular-ilioischial distance criterion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of protrusio increased until the age of twenty years and remained stable after the age of twenty years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Slight but significant negative correlations were detected between the two radiographic indices of acetabular depth and both the Iowa hip score and the summed range of motion (p &lt; 0.02 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant relationship was found between the two radiographic indices and pain scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who were more than forty years old, the Iowa hip scores for hips with protrusio were not significantly lower than those for hips without protrusio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003179'>protrusio acetabuli</z:hpo> increases during the first two decades of life and then plateaus in terms of both population-wide prevalence and radiographic severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this population, protrusio generally is not associated with severely problematic hip function but it is associated with slightly decreased range of motion of the hip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We concluded that prophylactic surgical intervention is not indicated for most patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who have a radiographic diagnosis of protrusio </plain></SENT>
