<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery and Transplantology of the Jagiellonian University in Cracow, aortic valve or aortic root replacement with allogenic aortic valve has been performed for 23 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Allogenic heart valve bank was founded in 1980 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the bank we prepare both aortic allografts for adult cardiac surgical procedures and pulmonary allografts that are mostly used for repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo>.Allogenic aortic valves implantation was usually considered in our clinic for older patients, patients with infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> of the native or prosthetic valve, young women in reproductive age and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Allografts exhibit excellent clinical performance and acceptable durability with no early failure if properly inserted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Between 1980 and 1992, allografts were obtained only from cadavers during routine autopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More than 10% of prepared allografts were exported to other cardiac surgery centres in Poland and foreign countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aortic valve replacement using allogenic aortic valves can be performed with acceptable mortality and good long-term results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The procedure although surgically more challenging has the advantage of not requiring anticoagulation therapy, hemodynamic performance of the allogenic valve is excellent, it demonstrates freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We would like to emphasize the importance and advantages of the fact that allogenic heart valve bank is placed in the department of cardiovascular surgery and it is able to supply the department in heart valve allografts 24 h a day </plain></SENT>
