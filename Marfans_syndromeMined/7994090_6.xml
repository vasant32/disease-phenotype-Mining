<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six of the 150 patients had a preoperative dissection of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were no early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> among 138 patients undergoing elective composite graft repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was one early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> among 12 patients undergoing urgent operation; this patient arrived at the hospital with a rupturing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four of the 150 patients had mitral procedures; there were no early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There have been 14 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> among the 149 hospital survivors (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival of 150 patients at 1, 5, 10, and 14 years was 93%, 92%, 81%, and 73% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for early or late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were identified by multivariate analysis and only New York Heart Association class (III or IV) and male gender emerged as significant independent predictors of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Late complications directly related to the composite graft have been gratifyingly low; only 2 patients had coronary dehiscence and 3 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>Endocarditis</z:hpo> emerged as an important late complication in 8 patients (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients were successfully treated with antibiotics, 3 died before widespread availability of cryopreserved homografts, and 3 patients treated with antibiotics and homograft root replacement have had no evidence of recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seven patients with dissection in this series had aortic diameters of 6.5 cm or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This experience supports the concept that composite graft repair in Marfan patients is mandated when the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> reaches 5.5 to 6 cm, even in the asymptomatic patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
