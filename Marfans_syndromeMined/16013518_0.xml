<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This disease does not appear very often and therefore it is often diagnosed late </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic and therapeutic developments have recently improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Classification and indication criteria about prophylactic interventions on aorta have become more specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It leads to the gradual decrease of mortality caused by this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Frequent accumulation of familiar aortal dissection was described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It can be important for the early identification of individuals at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In our casuistry we describe a family with the accumulation of aortal dissection coinciding with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> from the mother's side and the prevalence of this disease in siblings from their patient's father </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The evident predisposition was not clearly demonstrated in these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also examined and began to dispenser other members of the family but we did not find an evident predisposition factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We would like to emphasize the importance of good interdisciplinary and institutional cooperation in diagnostic and treatment of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further we want to emphasize the contribution of careful sampling of familiar anamnesis in the cases stricken with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We focused on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is well known that the gene analysis may contribute to the identification of individuals at risk in these families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We do not have this possibility in our country now </plain></SENT>
