<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 69 cases the aortic valve was incompetent due to a non-inflammatory aortic root disease such as myxomatous infiltration of the cusps and or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among these patients males were prevalent (male/female ratio = 2.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 37 +/- 7.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026267" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PMV">floppy mitral valve</z:e> was diagnosed in 16 cases while in one a left <z:mp ids='MP_0003392'>atrial myxoma</z:mp> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into 3 groups: Group 1-29 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cusps; Group 2-25 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> and myxomatous infiltration of aortic cusps (floppy aortic valve); and Group 3-15 patients with floppy aortic valve and undilated aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the gross examination the cusps of the patients in Groups 2 and 3 were redundant, thin, soft and gelatinous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The histology showed myxomatous infiltration with disruption of the fibrous layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> the histology of the aortic root fragments showed a cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Deep correlation was found between the root <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and the grade of aortic wall cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cusp's diastasis was the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo>, while cusp <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> caused <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003504" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ai">aortic incompetence</z:e> in presence of the floppy aortic valve and undilated aortic root.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
