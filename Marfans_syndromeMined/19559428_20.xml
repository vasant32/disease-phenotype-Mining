<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of a unique noncontact method of liquid nitrogen cryoablation as measured by histologic response rate and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Single-center, nonrandomized cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Referral center, conducted between September 2005 and September 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Patients with BE and HGD or IMCA who were deemed inoperable or who refused esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age, length of BE, and previous ablation were not exclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Cryoablation every 6 weeks until endoscopic resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EMR was used for pathologic staging of nodular areas before cryoablation and focal residual areas during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Histologic response was defined by the worst pathology obtained at any level of the esophagus or gastric cardia in 1 of 3 categories: (1) incremental = absence of HGD and IMCA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> biopsy specimens, (2) partial = residual IMCA with absence of any <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and (3) complete = absence of any <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty patients underwent ablation; 9 had undergone previous ablation or mucosectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven of 30 patients (90%) had downgrading of pathology stage after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Elimination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or downgrading of HGD at last follow-up was 68% for HGD and 80.0% for IMCA, with a median follow-up period of 12 months (25th percentile, 6; 75th percentile, 24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Minor adverse events included mild pain (n = 7), a low incidence of mild strictures (n = 3), and lip <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One major adverse event (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>) in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> occurred with the prototype system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 3 of 6 patients with complete response had recurrence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in the gastric cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: A nonrandomized, single-center study with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with BE and HGD or IMCA have a positive response to endoscopic cryotherapy at 1-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
