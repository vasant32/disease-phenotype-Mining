<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin-1 (FBN1), a component of the extracellular microfibril, cause the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This statement is supported by the observations that the classic Marfan phenotype cosegregates with intragenic and/or flanking marker alleles in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> families tested and that a significant number of FBN1 mutations have been identified in affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have now devised a method to screen the entire coding sequence and flanking splice junctions of FBN1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On completion for a panel of nine probands with classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, six new mutations were identified that accounted for disease in seven (78%) of nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine additional new mutations have been characterized in the early stages of a larger screening project </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These 15 mutations were equally distributed throughout the gene and, with one exception, were specific to single families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One-third of mutations created premature termination codons, and 6 of 15 substituted residues with putative significance for calcium binding to epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutations causing severe and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapidly progressive</z:hpo> disease that presents in the neonatal period can occur in a larger region of the gene than previously demonstrated, and the nature of the mutation is as important a determinant as its location, in predisposing to this phenotype </plain></SENT>
