<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These pleiotropic manifestations are accounted for by mutations in fibrillin-1, the building block of extracellular microfibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the past 10 years, we have witnessed significant progress in delineating the pathological events responsible for the manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Much of this progress has been based on the creation and analysis of fibrillin-1 mutant mouse lines that faithfully recapitulate the spectrum of clinical severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These studies have established the critical contribution of fibrillin-1 deficiency to disease progression through altered cell-matrix interactions and dysregulated TGF-beta signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a result, our definition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> as the prototypical structural disorder of the connective tissue has changed to that of a developmental abnormality with broad and complex effects on the morphogenesis and function of multiple organ systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, new biological targets have emerged that may yield exciting new opportunities for the development of productive treatment strategies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
