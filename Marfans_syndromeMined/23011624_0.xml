<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Strain and strain rate imaging have been reported to detect cardiac dysfunction more accurately than conventional methods in adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, but their utility has not been proven in younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether strain and strain rate imaging would allow early detection of cardiac dysfunction in children and young adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Unoperated patients (&lt;30 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and healthy control participants were prospectively enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with greater than mild mitral or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular systolic function was assessed by standard M-mode imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The strain and strain rate values were obtained from apical 4-chamber (longitudinal) and parasternal short-axis views at basal and midventricular levels (radial and circumferential) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data from the two groups were compared by a t test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (mean age ± SD, 14.4 ± 6.4 years; range, 5.8-28.9 years) and 26 controls (mean age, 12.4 + 4.4 year; range, 4.1-18.1 years) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Demographics and left ventricular end-diastolic dimensions were similar between the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The M-mode-derived shortening fraction was significantly lower in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> compared to the controls, even though the values were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> had lower regional radial and circumferential strain rates, but there were no significant difference in strain between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Strain rate imaging may be useful in detection of subclinical changes in cardiac function in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> when conventional echocardiographic parameters are within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings may be clinically important and warrant closer follow-up of these patients to monitor for cardiac dysfunction </plain></SENT>
