<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: With the general increase in human lifespan, cardiac surgeons are faced with treating an increasing number of elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to demonstrate early and late results of surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in patients older than 70 years of age compared with those younger than 70 years and to clarify the clinical problems related to this subset of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1976 and 2001, 315 patients underwent emergency operation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection: 245 were younger than 70 years (group 1) and 70 patients were 70 years of age and older (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early and late outcomes of both groups were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The hospital mortality rates were 20.5% in group 1 and 17.6% in group 2 (p = 0.751) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean extracorporeal circulation time was 192.6 +/- 65.2 minutes and 185.7 +/- 58.4 minutes in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p = 0.42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean cross-clamp time was 116.3 +/- 45.8 minutes and 100 +/- 36.7 minutes in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival rates were 77.1% after a mean follow-up time of 259 +/- 9 months for patients of group 1 and 80% after 77 +/- 5 months for patients of group 2, without any statistically significant difference (p = 0.619) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences were observed in the 30-day mortality and actuarial survival between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore we believe that surgery for type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in patients 70 years of age or older can be performed with acceptable risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and satisfactory results </plain></SENT>
