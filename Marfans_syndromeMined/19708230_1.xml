<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0006702'>Spontaneous coronary artery dissection</z:hpo> (SCAD) is an unusual cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> that in almost 50% of cases is followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The increasing frequency of SCAD diagnosis may reflect the widespread use of coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary interventions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndromes (ACS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of SCAD is estimated between 0.1 and 0.28% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ACS or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden deaths</z:hpo> evaluated by angiography or by anatomical examination, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most published data available so far deal with single case reports and probably the real incidence of this disease is underestimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some predisposing conditions to SCAD are well known and include <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, pregnancy and peripartum state, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013146" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">drug abuse</z:e> and some anatomical <z:hpo ids='HP_0006704'>abnormalities of the coronary arteries</z:hpo> like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and severe kinking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most appropriate therapeutic approach to SCAD is still controversial and decision making is often based on the clinical presentation, extent of dissection and amount of ischemic myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: The purpose of this multicenter prospective registry, named DISCOVERY (DISsection of COronary arteries: Veneto and Emilia RegistrY), with a case-control group is to try to assess the role of SCAD in the pathogenesis of ACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint is the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events related to the therapeutic strategy in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase and in the mid-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The secondary endpoints are the estimation of the prevalence of SCAD in the pathogenesis of ACS, the association or disassociation of SCAD with presumptive predisposing factors, the appreciation of the timing and extent of multivessel involvement when present, the occurrence of vascular and ocular comorbidities (i.e. carotid dissection and ocular lens abnormalities), the evaluation of the immediate success and the mid-term outcome of percutaneous coronary interventions and the definition of the role of intravascular ultrasound in diagnosis and treatment of SCAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The enrollment of approximately 50 patients with SCAD is planned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A planned control group of patients of comparable age, sex and clinical presentation will allow us to identify potential peculiar or specific aspects of SCAD in any phase of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The DISCOVERY multicenter registry, with a case-control group, is the first large prospective study aimed at assessing the role of SCAD in the pathogenesis of ACS and at identifying the role of different therapeutic strategies in this unusual, multifaceted and probably underestimated pathologic condition </plain></SENT>
