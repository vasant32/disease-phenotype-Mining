<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective case series of three patients, ages 9 1/2, 13, and 20 years old, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> treated for atlantoaxial rotatory subluxation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the first two cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> torticollis was noted postoperatively, following <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was made in the third patient after she presented to the emergency room with a week-long history of unresolved neck pain following minor trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report and discuss the courses and clinical sequelae of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003414'>atlantoaxial subluxation</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Radiographic analysis of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> has shown that increased atlantoaxial translation, larger odontoid height, and basilar impression are more prevalent in this population compared to age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite these findings, there are sparse data on injuries secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0010646'>cervical spine instability</z:hpo> or abnormalities in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To the authors' best knowledge, no report of atlantoaxial rotatory subluxation in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> exists in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Case records of rotatory instability of the atlanto-axial level were reviewed and are presented in the following report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The first two patients described in this report were noted to have "cock robin" posturing of their necks following <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> repairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The first patient's subluxation was partially reduced with halo traction, and he subsequently underwent posterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>spinal fusion</z:hpo> of C1-C2 with internal fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient was well aligned postoperatively, and had no neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The second patient's subluxation reduced after 20 days of halter and traction; he was immobilized in a collar following discharge and reduction was maintained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The third patient's subluxation failed to reduce with halo traction; further imaging studies revealed odontoid prominence in the foramen magnum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>She underwent posterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>spinal fusion</z:hpo>, occiput to C3, with satisfactory result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The cervical bony and ligamentous abnormalities seen in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> may slightly increase their risk for atlantoaxial rotatory instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Special attention to intubation and positioning, both intraoperatively and postoperatively, may be necessary in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Additionally, rotatory subluxation should be included in the differential diagnosis for Marfan patients with neck pain after injury </plain></SENT>
