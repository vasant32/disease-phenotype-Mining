<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze the results of surgical treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Few studies have been reported in the literature on surgical treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, analyzing long-term results of posterior instrumented fusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> with a mean age of 17 years (range, 11-31 years) were treated surgically from 1982 to 1995 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, using a posterior instrumented fusion alone (Harrington rod with sublaminar wires in the first 16 cases, and a more recent hybrid instrumentation in the remaining 7 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients received a long posterior instrumented fusion, including 12.3 levels on average (range, 9-17), extending the fusion area to vertebrae that were neutral and stable in both coronal and sagittal planes before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were analyzed as two different groups (Group 1 and Group 2) according to the different posterior instrumentations employed: Group 1 included 16 patients treated by the Harrington distraction rod technique with sublaminar wires, while Group 2 included 7 patients treated using more recent hybrid instrumentations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Presentation features, complications, and results were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At a minimum follow-up of 7 years (maximum, 18 years), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 23 patients were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 26.8 years (range, 20-38 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> value of 69.91 degrees was initially corrected to 38.17 degrees, averaged 40.89 degrees 1 year after surgery, and was finally equal to 44.09 degrees at the last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Differences in terms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> correction achieved with different instrumentations (Groups 1 and 2) did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In Group 2 patients, the percentage of postoperative correction was slightly lower (44.23%) than that of Group 1 (46.55%) but remained more stable at the last follow-up (40.97% vs. 36.38% of Group 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were 11 complications in 10 of the 23 patients (43.4%); two complications occurred in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Intraoperatively, dural tears occurred in 2 cases (8.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Pseudarthrosis with instrumentation failure in 2 cases (8.6%) required revision surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Five (21.7%) distal hook dislodgements with moderate loss of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> correction, 1 (4.3%) mild loss of correction without instrumentation failure, and 1 asymptomatic cervicothoracic junctional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo>. did not require surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> complications occurred among the 16 Group 1 patients, treated using the Harrington rod instrumentation with sublaminar wires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results seemed to demonstrate that a satisfactory stabilization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> can be achieved by posterior instrumentation alone in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Instrumented posterior fusion should be extended to include vertebrae that are neutral and stable in both coronal and sagittal planes before surgery, in order to ensure stabilization of the deformity and reduce the risks of decompensation of the spine </plain></SENT>
