<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine the possible correlation between pre-dissection aortic diameter and the occurrence of Stanford type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Samples of dissected ascending aortas were obtained from 220 patients at the time of their operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two groups were identified: patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> (Group 1, n=94) and those without (Group 2, n=126) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurements of the true (intimal) lumen were conducted and extrapolated as reliable approximation of pre-dissection aortic diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The possible association of intimal diameter with anthropometric and demographic data was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median aortic diameter was, respectively, 41.8 and 41.3mm for patients with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> (41.4mm for the entire cohort) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data analysis indicated that 57% of patients had aortic diameter above 40 mm, while patients with frank <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> accounted only for 10%; this proportion was higher in Group 1 compared to Group 2 (17.2% vs 4.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Poor or no correlation was demonstrated between aortic size and any of the anthropometric or demographic variables assayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant subgroup differences were found among patients with a history of cigarette smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although aortic diameter remains a strong indication for preventive surgery in patients with inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> occurs rarely in the setting of true <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysms</z:hpo>, and despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or near-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aortic size in more than one-third of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Dissection superimposing on small aortic diameters can be regarded as an expression of substantial functional tissue susceptibility to aortic catastrophic events </plain></SENT>
