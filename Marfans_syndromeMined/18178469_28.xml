<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> has been associated with mutations of the gene encoding fibrillin-1 (FBN1), a major constituent of the elastic fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are important in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> but their precise role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">Doxycycline</z:chebi> is a nonspecific MMP inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The objective of the study was to determine whether docycycline can attenuate matrix degradation and prolong the survival of mice with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study employed a well-characterized animal model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, namely fibrillin-1 under-expressing mice (mgR/mgR mice) that die spontaneously from rupture of the thoracic aorta between 2 to 4 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutant and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> mice were given <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi> in their drinking water at a concentration designed to provide 100 mg/kg/day beginning at postnatal day (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) 1, whereas control mice were given water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treated mice were divided into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One group of animals was followed until <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or for 7 months to determine lifespan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the second group of mice, the ascending thoracic aortas were collected for histological analysis (H&amp;E staining, trichrome staining) and zymography for examining MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels at 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels were higher in the thoracic aorta of mgR/mgR mice compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">Doxycycline</z:chebi>-treated mgR/mgR mice lived 132 +/- 14.6 days (n = 16) or significantly longer than untreated mutant mice (79 +/- 6.7 days, n = 30) (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Connective tissue staining showed that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi> treatment decreased elastic fiber degradation in mgR/mgR mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, mgR/mgR mice treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi> had lower MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels compared with untreated mgR/mgR mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi> significantly delays <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>-like mice by inhibiting expression of tissue MMP-2 and MMP-9 and thus, degradation of the elastic matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that MMPs contribute to the progression of thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi> has the potential to significantly alter the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
