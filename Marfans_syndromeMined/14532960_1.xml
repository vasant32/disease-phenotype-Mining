<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the clinical profile as described in adults was compared with that found in children up to the age of 13 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-five children with echocardiographic-proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> and who met the inclusion criteria were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The male:female ratio in this study was 1:1.37 and was not statistically significantly different from reported ratios </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one of the 31 patients referred from outside the hospital had an incidentally found murmur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The symptoms found in this study were not similar to those described in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most commonly found symptoms were <z:mp ids='MP_0001954'>shortness of breath</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, in contrast to those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> described in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparing males to females in this study, significantly lower weight (p = 0.005) and body mass index (p = 0.003) were found in girls, and a significantly lower pulse rate (p = 0.002) in boys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Left-sided cardiac enlargement was diagnosed in 11 patients on chest X-ray and in six patients on electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, most children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> are asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>Mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> is not an uncommon finding in children younger than 13 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral valve regurgitation</z:hpo> were advised to take infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> prophylaxis prior to invasive procedures </plain></SENT>
