<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To establish national clinical guidelines and integrated care pathways for five conditions (tuberous <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (TS), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>), myotonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> (MD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> type 1 (NF1), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (MS)) and audit their use in Scotland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Systematic review of published reports followed by consensus conferences to prepare clinical guidelines and integrated care pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Structured review of medical records before and after introduction of integrated care pathways to document changes in practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survey of staff views on procedures adopted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four clinical genetics centres in Scotland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Project resulted in reduced variation in practice across centres, improved data recording in medical records, and improved communication with other professional groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A very poor evidence base for management of patients with the conditions studied was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A collaborative structure for undertaking clinical research would improve the evidence base for current practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>National discussion of the boundaries of responsibility of care for the long term management of patients with these disorders is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The integrated care pathway approach shows promise as a means of facilitating the development of audit within clinical genetics services </plain></SENT>
