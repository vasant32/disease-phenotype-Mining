<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of detecting and estimating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> were assessed by two-dimensional pulsed Doppler echocardiography (PDE) for 85 patients, aged 17 to 79 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>Mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> was clinically diagnosed in 10 patients, and confirmed by angiography in 60 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using real time two-dimensional images and M-mode displays, the sample volumes were taken at 36 sites, including the mitral ostium, the left atrium, and the left ventricular inflow tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Doppler signals were analyzed by the FFT method and the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> was based on the systolic turbulence with a wide range of velocities greater than +/- 1 KHz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results obtained were as follows: In 61 of 70 cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo>, distinctly abnormal systolic Doppler signals were detected at the mitral ostium or within the left atrium, which were not recorded in the other 15 cases without angiocardiographically documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The signals had either unidirectional or bidirectional wide frequency-band patterns, which were thought to indicate the systolic turbulence caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo>, because these were occasionally recorded beyond the second heart sound, and increased with the administration of methoxamine and diminished after the inhalation of amyl <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> was graded I degree, II degree, III degree and IV degree based on Sellers' classification, a PDE sensitivity for detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> was 78.1, 89.5, 100 and 100%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When approaches were divided by the parasternal long-axis, parasternal short-axis and apical long-axis, a PDE sensitivity was 80.0, 74.2, and 70.0%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The PDE was highly sensitive in diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264757" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic valvular disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> or ruptured chordae tendineae (sensitivity 100%), but it was less sensitive in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nine cases in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> was missed by PDE, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> was mild (seven cases: Sellers I degree, two cases: Sellers II degree) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No false positives were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall sensitivity of the PDE was 87.1%, with a specificity of 100%, a diagnostic accuracy of 89.4%, and a predictive value of 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>By displaying the distribution of systolic turbulence on parasternal or apical long-axis image (flow mapping), the direction and the extent of the regurgitant flow in the left atrium were clearly visualized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The localization of the regurgitant flow at the mitral ostium was visualized in parasternal short-axis images by the flow mapping method.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
