<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) and the other type-1 fibrillinopathies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Finding these mutations is a major challenge considering that the FBN1 gene has a coding region of 8,600 base pairs divided into 65 exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of the more than 600 known mutations have been identified using a mutation scanning method prior to sequencing of fragments with a suspected mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, it is not obvious that these screening methods are ideal, considering cost, efficiency, and sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have sequenced the entire FBN1 coding sequence and flanking intronic sequences in samples from 105 patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, taking advantage of robotic devices, which reduce the cost of supplies and the quantity of manual work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, automation avoids many tedious steps, thus reducing the opportunity for human error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Automated assembling of PCR, purification of PCR products, and assembly of sequencing reactions resulted in completion of the FBN1 sequence in half of the time needed for the manual protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutations were identified in 69 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mutation detection rate (76%), types, and genetic distribution of mutations resemble the findings in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that automated sequencing using the robotic systems is well suited as a primary strategy for diagnostic mutation identification in FBN1 </plain></SENT>
