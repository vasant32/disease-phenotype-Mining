<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Systemic hypertension</z:hpo> had been present in 63 of 121 cases (52%) with type I or II dissection and in 30 of 40 (75%) with type III dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic dissection</z:hpo> involved 7 of 16 cases (44%) with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in persons with congenitally bicuspid and unicommissural aortic valves, respectively, was 9 and 18 times that in subjects with tricuspid aortic valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age of those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and tricuspid, bicuspid and unicommissural aortic valves was 63, 55 and 40 years, respectively, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> was more common in men than in women </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the major risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo>, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and, for type I and II dissections, congenitally bicuspid or unicommissural aortic valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aortic medial degeneration was a less important risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rupture of ulcerocalcific aortic atheromas may have initiated the intimal tear in some type III dissections </plain></SENT>
