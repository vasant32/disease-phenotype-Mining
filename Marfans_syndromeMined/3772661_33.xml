<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Turner syndrome</z:e> who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and rupture, one with prior repair of coarctation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also note the high incidence (8.8%) of unrecognized aortic root dilation in a group of 57 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Turner syndrome</z:e> whom we prospectively evaluated by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our analysis and review of previously reported cases suggests that multiple risk factors may exist for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, including coarctation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo>, but that these need not be present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aortic root dilation may be an additional finding that suggests the patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Turner syndrome</z:e> is also at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When it is present, magnetic resonance imaging visualizes the entire aorta and allows quantification of the site and degree of dilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with dissection, the aorta often exhibits pathologic evidence of cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> similar to the finding in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic methods to decrease risk, such as those directed toward prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006689'>bacterial endocarditis</z:hpo>, blood pressure control, and perhaps prophylactic beta blockade or surgical reconstruction, may need to be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Turner syndrome</z:e>, their families, and the physicians who care for them should be aware of the significance of unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> as potential manifestations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> or rupture </plain></SENT>
