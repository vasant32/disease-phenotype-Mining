<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mitral valve (MV) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> (MVP) has a high prevalence of 2% to 3% in the general population and thus constitutes the most common cause of severe nonischemic MV regurgitation (MVR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MVP is also common in persons with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, to date, a large-scale population-based cohort study using modern echocardiographic techniques has not been performed, and the frequency of MVP and the relation of MV dysfunction and age have not been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we conducted a population-based cohort study of 204 patients (108 males and 96 females, aged 31.2 ± 16.4 years) with classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed echocardiographic follow-up of 174 patients for a mean of 4.4 ± 4.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the initial or subsequent echocardiographic scan, MVP was present in 82 patients (40%), severe MVR in 25 (12%), and MV <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> in 5 patients (2.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 30 years of age, the Weibull cumulative distribution was 42.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 36% to 50%) for MVP, 56.5% (95% CI 49.3% to 64%) for MVR of any degree, 6.7% (95% CI 3.9% to 11.3%) for severe MVR, and 0.92% (95% CI 0.21% to 3.91%) for MV <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cumulative hazard for severe MVR and MV <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> was estimated to increase with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MVP was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> (p = 0.01), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> (p = 0.02), and skeletal involvement (p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Severe MVR was related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001704'>tricuspid valve prolapse</z:hpo> (p = 0.002) and to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> form of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, MVP was comparatively frequent in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and carries an increased risk of progression to severe MVR and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, especially in older adults </plain></SENT>
