<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Extracellular matrix remodeling in the aortic wall results in increased aortic stiffness (AoS) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pulsed-wave velocity (PWV) constitutes the best indirect AoS measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess PWV in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients using two-dimensional (2D) and Doppler echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients, (mean age 31 Â± 14 years, 16 men) and 31 controls were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood flow was recorded in the aorta near the aortic valve and immediately after in the descending aorta with simultaneous electrocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PWV was calculated by dividing the distance between the two sample volume positions (D) by the time difference (TD) between the intervals from the QRS start to the ascending and descending aortic flow <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onsets</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>B-stiffness was also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TD (described in "Methods" section) and, aortic arch length were significantly increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients, P &lt; 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, PWV values were significantly higher in patients when compared with controls, 7.20 m/s (5.12, 9.43) versus 4.64 m/s (3.37, 6.24), P &lt; 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>B-stiffness was also significantly increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients; 5.15 (3.69, 7.65) versus 2.44 (1.82, 3.66), P &lt; 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis showed a positive association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> diagnosis and age, (P = 0.002 and 0.009, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Reproducibility of PWV measurements was &lt;5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AoS was significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients as expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrated that PWV measurements can be performed, in the absence of serious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151491" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">musculoskeletal abnormalities</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> adults, as part of a cardiac ultrasound scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This technique can be helpful in diagnosis and management in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
