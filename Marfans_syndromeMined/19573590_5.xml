<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> has a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>variable phenotype</z:hpo>, even within families carrying the same FBN1 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Differences in gene expression resulting from sequence differences in the promoter region of the FBN1 gene are likely to be involved in causing this <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>phenotypic variability</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report, we present an analysis of FBN1 transcription start site (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSS</z:e>) use in mouse and human tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that transcription of FBN1 initiated primarily from a single CpG-rich promoter which was highly conserved in mammals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It contained potential binding sites for a number of factors implicated in mesenchyme differentiation and gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002669'>osteosarcoma</z:hpo> line MG63 had high levels of FBN1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and secreted fibrillin-1 protein to form extracellular matrix fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The human embryonic kidney line HEK293 and two <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> lines MCF7 and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-MB-231 had levels of FBN1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> 1000 fold lower and produced negligible amounts of fibrillin-1 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore MG63 appears to be the optimal cell line for examining tissue-specific, biologically relevant promoter activity for FBN1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In reporter assays, the conserved promoter region was more active in MG63 cells than in non-FBN1-expressing lines but additional elements outside the proximal promoter are probably required for optimal tissue-specific expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Understanding the regulation of the FBN1 gene may lead to alternative therapeutic strategies for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
