<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a result, abnormalities in the structure of the constituent chains of types I and III collagens and in post-translational modifications of these molecules have been identified (fig. 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the pathophysiologic effects on tissues are becoming better understood, and diagnostic tests, including prenatal diagnosis, for specific disorders are becoming available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These diseases have provided many opportunities for research into the mechanisms by which collagen biosynthesis is regulated, the requirements for secretion, the role of specific collagens in tissues, and the function of certain crosslinks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As genomic probes for the different collagen genes are developed, the contributions of studies of these diseases to an understanding of gene structure and function can only increase, as will the opportunities for more detailed approaches to molecular analysis </plain></SENT>
