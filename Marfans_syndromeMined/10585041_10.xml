<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> reoperations (n = 134) on the aortic root and ascending aorta performed between February 1981 and April 1998 were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indications for reintervention were a true or false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (35%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection (3.0%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic valve stenosis</z:hpo> and/or insufficiency (23.1%), prosthetic valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (32.8%), and combinations (4.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The principal reoperations performed were aortic root replacement (composite graft, freestyle, aortic allograft, or pulmonary autograft) in 116 patients, ascending aortic replacement in 10 patients, and closure of a false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results were analyzed using univariate statistical methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hospital mortality was 6.6% (8 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Univariate predictors of hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were preoperative functional class III or IV (p = 0.02), an interval of less than 6 months between the primary and actual operation (p = 0.02), preoperative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> level of more than 200 micromol/L (p = 0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (p = 0.001), intraoperative technical problems (p = 0.001), and postoperative dialysis (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Freedom from repetitive reoperation was 99% at 1 year and 98% at 5 and 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reoperations on the aortic root and ascending aorta can be performed with an early mortality which is very acceptable </plain></SENT>
