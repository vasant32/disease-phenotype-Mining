<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies examining the biosynthesis and secretion of recombinant fibrillin-1 fragments have been performed in cell lines which do not assemble fibrillin into extracellular 10-12 nm microfibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conflicting data have been obtained regarding N-terminal processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study we have characterised a human fibroblast cell line <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSU</z:e>-1.1 which shows a similar endogenous fibrillin-1 pulse chase profile to primary human dermal fibroblasts and produces microfibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of a approximately 50 kDa N-terminal recombinant <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSU</z:e>-1.1 resulted in efficient secretion of this <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> into conditioned media, N-terminal sequence analysis of the purified <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> identified 2 protease cleavage sites and a presumed signal peptidase site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together these data identify the natural leader sequence of fibrillin-1 and the presence of two processing sites in the N-terminus of fibrillin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The identification of an N-terminal processing site in recombinant fibrillin-1 similar to that obtained in a previous study which used an HT1080 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100244'>fibrosarcoma</z:hpo> host cell line excludes defective N-terminal processing as the cause of the assembly defect in this cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A full length <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and mutant fibrillin cDNA (approximately 8.6 kb) was constructed and stable integration of each into MSU1.1 led to <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> transcription at approximately 5% of endogenous levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of transcription from the full length fibrillin-1 cDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The low levels of transcription achieved, suggest that additional upstream and downstream DNA sequence elements will be required for high levels of full length fibrillin-1 cDNA expression </plain></SENT>
