<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Retrograde type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> has been deemed a rare complication after endovascular stent graft placement for type B dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this life-threatening event appears to be underrecognized and is worth being investigated further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Eleven of 443 patients developed retrograde type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> during or after stent grafting for type B dissection from August 2000 to June 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these 11 patients, 3 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the rate of freedom from this event at 36 months is 97.4% (95% confidence interval, 0.95 to 0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The new entry was located at the tip of the proximal bare spring of the stent graft in 9 patients, was within the anchoring area of the proximal bare spring in 1, and remained unknown in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight patients were converted to open surgery, and 2 received medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient suddenly died 2 hours after the primary stent grafting, and 2 died within 1 week after the surgical conversion, so mortality reached 27.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up from 3 to 50 months, type I endoleak was identified in 1 patient 3 months after the surgical exploration and disappeared at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Retrograde type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> after stent grafting for type B dissection appears not to be rare and results from mixed causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fragility of the aortic wall and disease progression may predispose to it, whereas stent grafting-related factors make important and provocative contributions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Avoiding aortic arch stent grafting in Marfan patients, preferably selecting the endograft without the proximal bare spring for patients with a kinked aortic arch or with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (if endografting is used), improving the device design, and standardizing endovascular manipulation might lessen its occurrence </plain></SENT>
