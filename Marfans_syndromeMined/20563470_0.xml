<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term surgical results of aortic valve-preserving procedures to the root reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1996 to 2008, 54 consecutive patients underwent two different techniques of valve-sparing aortic root operation (40 Yacoub operations and 14 David operations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 48 +/- 14 years (range 17 to 74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>36 patients (66.7%) were male and 16 (29.6%) experienced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean Euroscore was 4 +/- 1.25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean follow up time was 4.1 years (from 49 days to 10.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical and echocardiographic parameters were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>T-Student paired test, the McNemar Non Parametric test and the Kaplan-Meyer Outcome Curves have been used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The hospital mortality was 5.6% and the average hospitalization time was 9+/-4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One non related late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (2%) was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival and freedom from reoperation were respectively 94.4% and 96% within 11 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were benefits in reduction of functional class (P=0.002; 78% CF I), in reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.001; 78% with or without discrete reflux), in reduction of systolic and diastolic diameters, end-sytolic and end-diastolic volumes of left ventricle (respectively P=0.004; P&lt;0.0001; P=0.036 and P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two (3.9%) patients required aortic valve replacement due to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> during this same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No thromboembolic, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> events were reported during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The valve-sparing operation for aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> is an effective alternative to the use of a mechanical valve conduit replacement </plain></SENT>
