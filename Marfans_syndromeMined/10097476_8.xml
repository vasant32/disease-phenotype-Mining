<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subjects were 46 patients who underwent aortic and/or aortic valve surgery between August 1965 and October 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had histologically documented cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> including 22 Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> were substantially younger (median age, 32 vs 50 years; p &lt; 0.05), and experienced annulo-aortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> more frequently {81% (17/22) vs 46% (11/24); p &lt; 0.05} than those without the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-eight percent (15/22) of the Marfan patients and 63% (15/24) of the non-Marfan patients experienced complications with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, although not to a significant degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hospital mortality rate was 14% (3/22) in the Marfan group and 21% (5/24) in the non-Marfan group, which was also not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 38 survivors, developments in the health of 37 were completely followed-up until October 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cardiovascular event-free rate for Marfan patients at 10 years (28%) was lower than that for non-Marfan patients (68%, p = 0.057), whereas the actuarial survival rates at 10 years were nearly equal (72% for the Marfan patients and 74% for the non-Marfan patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reoperation was the first cardiovascular event in 77% (10/13) of the Marfan patients and in 14% (1/7) of the non-Marfan patients (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular event was the main cause of late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> both for Marfan patients (80%; 4/5) and for non-Marfan patients (86%; 6/7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, independent of the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, careful follow-up is necessary for patients with cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of the aorta to eliminate serious late complications </plain></SENT>
