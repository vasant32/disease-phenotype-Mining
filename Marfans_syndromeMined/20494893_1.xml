<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There have been isolated case reports of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> in males with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1567741" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Alport syndrome</z:e> (AS), a systemic disorder of Type IV collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we describe five new cases of AS associated with significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> including dissection and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We present brief clinical descriptions of five males with AS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed immunohistochemical analysis of the expression of the α5 chain of Type IV collagen in skin basement membranes from a previously reported family with AS and associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> and in the aortic media of male mice with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1567741" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Alport syndrome</z:e> (XLAS) due to a nonsense mutation in the COL4A5 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three of the five patients exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and dissection of the thoracic aorta, occurring at 25-32 years of age, while one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> and another had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five men required renal replacement therapy by age 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry of skin biopsy specimens in previously reported male siblings with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> confirmed that they had XLAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We further found that the α5 chain of Type IV collagen is abnormally absent from aortic media of transgenic mice with XLAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> may be an unusual feature of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Screening of men with AS for aortic abnormalities may be clinically indicated in some families </plain></SENT>
