<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> showed that admixed with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-looking portions, there were abnormal portions of the elastic fibers which were composed of many unusual fine fibers (5-22 nm in diameter), and had a cobweb-like appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The TEM showed that these fine fibers were substructures of the amorphous material and were surrounded by microfibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the fine fibers could be abnormal elastic fibers resulting from the incomplete fusion of the elastic units </plain></SENT>
