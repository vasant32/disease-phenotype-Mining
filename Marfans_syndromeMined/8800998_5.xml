<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential value of transoesophageal echocardiography combined with automated border detection and acoustic quantification for the assessment of elastic properties of the thoracic aorta in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: 16 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and 12 age matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transoesophageal echocardiography was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Minimum and maximum diameters of the descending thoracic aorta were obtained from M mode images and acoustic quantification was used for the on-line evaluation of cross sectional aortic area and peak positive area changes over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compliance, distensibility, and stiffness index were calculated using M mode data and non-invasively measured blood pressure and were compared with the indices derived from acoustic quantification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Aortic dimensions normalised for body surface area were not statistically different between patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, but there were significant differences for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> elasticity indices except compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Marfan patients had a lower distensibility [4.2 (SD 1.8) v 5.8 (2.1) cm2/dyn, P &lt; 0.05] and a higher stiffness index [9.7 (3.0) v 7.1 (1.8), P &lt; 0.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The dynamic indices derived from the acoustic quantification were significantly smaller in Marfan patients [peak positive area change: 5.1 (1.0) v 7.7 (1.7) cm2/s; P &lt; 0.001; and normalised peak positive area change: 2.5 (1.2) v 4.0 (0.8) cm2/s respectively, P &lt; 0.001] and were suitable to discriminate between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal elastic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> elastic properties of the descending aorta are significantly different from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, even in the absence of vessel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition to established static indices, indices derived from acoustic quantification reflect dynamic changes of the cross sectional area for the evaluation of regional vessel mechanics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The on-line assessment of peak positive area change allows differentiation from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and may be more accurate than standard M mode measurements </plain></SENT>
