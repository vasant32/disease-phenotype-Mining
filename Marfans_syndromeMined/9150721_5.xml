<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Linkage studies have mapped the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) locus to chromosome region 15q15-q21 with no convincing evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene, located at 15q21.1, that encodes the major component of the defective microfibrils, has been identified as the gene for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, extensive mutation screening in many laboratories has detected FBN1 mutations in only a fraction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> probands studied, leading to the hypothesis that the missing mutations could involve another microfibril gene located in the same region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, the gene for microfibril-associated protein-1 (MFAP1, also called <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>) has been isolated and mapped to the 15q15-q21 region that overlaps the location of the FBN1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we report that the two loci are physically close, making MFAP1 an alternative positional candidate gene for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have carried out MFAP1 mutation screening and gene expression analysis in 48 probands with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> or related phenotypes who were selected for this study because their fibroblast cultures synthesized fibrillin at <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No MFAP1 mutations were identified, and transcription occurred equally from both alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the MFAP1 locus is not a reservoir for the hidden <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> mutations </plain></SENT>
