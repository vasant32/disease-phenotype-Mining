<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients (18%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> (81 patients) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (63 patients) were the principal indications for operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients (16%) had previous operations on the ascending aorta or aortic valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hospital mortality rate was 5% and the duration of cardiopulmonary bypass was the only significant independent predictor of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (p = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Major modifications in technique were made in 1981, when the inclusion/wrap technique employing a composite graft (used in the first 105 procedures) was abandoned in favor of an open technique (used in 51 procedures), and in 1988, when aortic allografts and pulmonary autografts were introduced for selected conditions (reoperations, dissection, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic valve disease</z:e>) in 16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of follow-up was 81 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-six patients were followed for more than 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival rate was 61% at 7 years and 48% at 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in survival rate was observed between the patients with annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, or between the inclusion/wrap and open techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However the frequency of pseudoaneurysm formation at suture lines and the frequency of reoperations on the ascending aorta and aortic valve were less with the open technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The actuarial freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> for the 152 patients with prosthetic valves was 82% at 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One early and one late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred among the 16 patients with allograft or autograft root replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy was not used in these patients and no thromboembolic episodes occurred in the follow-up period (mean, 7 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The satisfactory results observed with extended follow-up support the continued use of the composite graft technique as the preferred method of treatment for patients with annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath>, persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the sinuses of Valsalva following previous operations, and for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004933'>ascending aortic dissection</z:hpo> who require aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The availability of aortic root allografts and the perfection of techniques for safe implantation of the autologous pulmonary root into the aortic position have broadened the indications for aortic root replacement </plain></SENT>
