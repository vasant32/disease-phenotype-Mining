<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>), increased aortic wall stiffening may lead to progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aortic Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV), a marker of wall stiffness can be assessed regionally, using in-plane multi-directional velocity-encoded MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the diagnostic accuracy of regional PWV for prediction of regional aortic <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> growth during 2-year follow-up in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In twenty-one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients (mean age 36±15years, 11 male) regional PWV and aortic <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> areas were assessed by 1.5T MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 2-year follow-up, the incidence of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> growth, defined as mean <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameter increase &gt;2mm was determined for five aortic segments (S1, ascending aorta; S2, aortic arch; S3, thoracic descending aorta, S4, supra-renal and S5, infra-renal abdominal aorta) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regional PWV at baseline was considered increased when exceeding age-related <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> PWV (healthy volunteers (n=26; mean age 30±10years, 15 male)) by two standard-errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity of regional PWV-testing for prediction of regional <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> growth were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Regional PWV at baseline was increased in 17 out of 102 segments (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> growth at follow-up was reported in 14 segments (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The specificity of regional PWV-testing was ≥78% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aortic segments, sensitivity was ≤33% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Regional PWV was significantly increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients as compared to healthy volunteers within similar age range, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aortic segments except the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, regional PWV-assessment has moderate to high specificity for predicting absence of regional aortic <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> growth for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aortic segments in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
