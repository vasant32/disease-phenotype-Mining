<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a rare and uncommon case of spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in a 48-year old female patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Turner syndrome</z:e> who was not apparently eligible for a prophylactic surgery </plain></SENT>
