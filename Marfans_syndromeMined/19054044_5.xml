<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The echocardiographic features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> (MVP) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> have been well described, and the incidence of MVP in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is reported to be 40-80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, most of the original research was performed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the diagnostic criteria for MVP were less specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to investigate the characteristics of MVP associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> using currently accepted diagnostic criteria for MVP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 1990 and March 2004, 90 patients with definitive diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (based on standardized criteria with or without genetic testing) were referred to Massachusetts General Hospital for transthoracic echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients' gender, age, weight, height, and body surface area at initial examination were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mitral valve thickness and motion, the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, and aortic dimensions were quantified blinded to patients' clinical information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 25 patients (28%) with MVP, among whom 80% had symmetrical bileaflet MVP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with MVP had thicker mitral leaflets (5.0 +/- 1.0 mm vs. 1.8 +/- 0.5 mm, P &lt; 0.001), more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (using a scale of 1-4, 2.2 +/- 1.0 vs. 0.90 +/- 0.60, P &lt; 0.0001), larger LVEDD, and larger dimensions of sinus of Valsalva, sinotubular junction, aortic arch, and descending aorta indexed to square root body surface area, when compared with those without MVP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When echocardiographic features of patients younger than 18 years of age and those of patients older than 18 were compared, adult Marfan patients had larger LA dimension (indexed to square root body surface area), larger sinotubular junction (indexed to square root body surface area), and more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of MVP in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is lower than previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The large majority of patients with MVP have bileaflet involvement, and those with MVP have significantly larger aortic root diameters, suggesting a diffuse disease process </plain></SENT>
