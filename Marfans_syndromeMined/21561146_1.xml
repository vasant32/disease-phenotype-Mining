<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some of the skeletal and ocular symptoms such as long bone <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> overlap with symptoms seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is caused by mutations in the extracellular matrix protein fibrillin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that fibrillin-1 is a target for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> and that the deposition of homocysteinylated fibrillin-1 in the extracellular matrix is compromised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since the assembly of fibrillin-1 is critically dependent on fibronectin, we analyzed the consequences of fibronectin homocysteinylation and its interaction with fibrillin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cellular fibronectin and proteolytic fragments were homocysteinylated and tested in various interaction assays with recombinant fibrillin-1 and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fibronectin homocysteinylation consistently compromised the fibronectin-fibrillin-1 interaction, while the interaction with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fibronectin homocysteinylation, but not cysteinylation, reduced the fibronectin dimers to monomers as shown by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ELISA analyses of homocysteinylated fibronectin with three monoclonal antibodies demonstrated structural changes in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi>-containing FNI domains FNI(2), FNI(4), and FNI(9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using fluorescently labeled fibronectin, we studied the consequence of fibronectin homocysteinylation on assembly in cell culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Modified fibronectin showed deficiencies in denovo matrix incorporation and initial assembly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we define here characteristic structural changes of fibronectin upon homocysteinylation that translate into functional deficiencies in the fibronectin-fibrillin-1 interaction and in fibronectin assembly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Since fibronectin is a major organizer of various extracellular protein networks, these structural and functional alterations may contribute to the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
