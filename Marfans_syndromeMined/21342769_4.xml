<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although there is adequate evidence that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp>) is an inheritable disorder, there is a great controversy regarding the pathogenesis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the proximal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hemodynamic theory was the first explanation for <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp> aortopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The genetic theory, however, has become increasingly popular over the last decade and can now be viewed as the clearly dominant one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The widespread belief that <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp> disease is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital disorder</z:e> of vascular connective tissue has led to more aggressive treatment recommendations of the proximal aorta in such patients, approaching aortic management recommendations for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is emerging evidence that the 'clinically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>' <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp> is associated with abnormal flow patterns and asymmetrically increased wall stress in the proximal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recent in vitro and in vivo studies on <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp> function provide a unique hemodynamic insight into the different phenotypes of <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp> disease and asymmetry of corresponding aortopathy even in the presence of a 'clinically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>' <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, there is a subgroup of young male patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp> and a root <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> phenotype, who may present the predominantly genetic form of <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the face of these important findings, we feel that a critical review of this clinical problem is timely and appropriate, as the prevailing <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp>-aortopathy theory undoubtedly affects the surgical approach to this common clinical entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thorough analysis of the recent literature shows a growing amount of evidence supporting the hemodynamic theory of aortopathy in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Data from recent studies requires a reevaluation of our overwhelming support of the genetic theory, and obliges us to acknowledge that hemodynamics plays an important role in the development of this disease process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Given the marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp> disease, further studies are required in order to more precisely determine which theory is the 'correct' one for explaining the obviously different types of <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp>-associated aortopathy </plain></SENT>
