<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Marfan patients who received composite graft replacement for proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> frequently require late reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The initial surgical technique for this lesion remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen Marfan patients who received composite graft replacement for annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> required late reoperation thorough re-median sternotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The techniques used for an initial composite graft replacement were the original Bentall procedure in 11 patients, the Cabrol procedure in 2, and coronary button technique in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reoperation was indicated for prosthesis-related complications in 10 patients, distal aortic lesion in 13, or for both lesions in 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reoperations were performed, on average, 8.4 years after an initial operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reoperative procedures included re-composite graft replacement in 1 patient, total arch replacement in 5, and re-composite graft replacement with total arch replacement in 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were two in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (14.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although pseudoaneurysms of the coronary artery or distal aorta occurred in the original Bentall or Cabrol procedures, true <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the coronary artery were noted even in the coronary button technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six patients required a total of eight subsequent descending or thoracoabdominal aortic replacements for an aneurysmal formation of a distal false lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The coronary button technique, with a small side hole for coronary anastomosis, is the procedure of choice for annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> because it reduces the risk of coronary artery-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Concomitant total arch replacement may be recommended for annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> with DeBakey type I <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in selected patients to avoid the risk of reoperation on the aortic arch </plain></SENT>
