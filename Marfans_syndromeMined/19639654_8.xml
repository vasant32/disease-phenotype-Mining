<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nonsyndromatic AAD also has a familial background, and mutations of the ACTA2 gene were recently shown to cause familial AAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we conducted sequence analyses of the ACTA2 gene in 14 unrelated Japanese patients with familial thoracic AAD (TAAD), and in 26 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and young-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> TAAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results identified three mutations of ACTA2, two novel [p.G152_T205del (c.616+1G&gt;T), p.R212Q] and one reported (p.R149C), in the 14 patients with familial TAAD, and a novel mutation (p.Y145C) of ACTA2 in the 26 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and young-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> TAAD patients, each of which are considered to be causative for TAAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some of the clinical features of these patients were the same as previously reported, whereas others were different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings confirm that ACTA2 mutations are important in familial TAAD, while the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and young-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> TAAD case with an ACTA2 mutation was also identified </plain></SENT>
