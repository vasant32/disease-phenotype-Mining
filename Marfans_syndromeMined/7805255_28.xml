<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This review discusses the incidence and importance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (CHD), the reasons that investigation of causative mechanisms for human CHD has been slow, and the limitations of the multifactorial theory for the etiology of CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The molecular defects underlying three vasculopathies--<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (fibrillin), supravalvar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175702" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Williams' syndrome</z:e> (elastin)--and hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo> are presented to emphasize the role of microfibrils and extracellular matrix in the pathophysiology of these vascular defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animal models of CHD, including <z:mp ids='MP_0002766'>situs inversus</z:mp>, canine conotruncal malformations, and chick neural crest ablation, are examined to emphasize how such studies relate to human CHD, especially by pointing to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037176" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">single-gene defects</z:e> for conotruncal malformations, candidate loci for <z:mp ids='MP_0002766'>situs inversus</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>phenotypic variability</z:hpo> caused by neural crest lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The crucial role of cardiac transcription factors in heart morphogenesis is emphasized by review of gene knockout studies of these factors, which cause fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> secondary to heart maldevelopment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several lines of evidence demonstrating genetic etiologies of human CHD are also presented, including the mapping of familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defects</z:hpo>, to prove that one anatomic type of CHD may be due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037176" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">single-gene defects</z:e> at different loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001674'>atrioventricular canal</z:hpo>, both secondary to <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 21 and as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal-dominant</z:hpo> familial defect, reiterates this conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The evidence that <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> on chromosome 22 causes multiple types of CHD, including aortic arch and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001710'>conotruncal defects</z:hpo> as part of the CATCH-22 syndrome, is presented, with results supporting the idea that deletions at this site alone may cause 5% of surgically treated CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that (1) human CHD is frequently due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037176" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">single-gene defects</z:e> and that even <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> defects may arise from a single-gene abnormality; (2) a common genetic defect may cause several apparently different forms of CHD; (3) elucidation of the genetic basis of CHD provides clues to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardiovascular developmental biology; (4) the same cardiac malformation can be caused by mutant genes at different loci; and (5) interactions of clinical investigators (cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons) with basic scientists should allow more rapid progress in defining the genetic basis of CHD </plain></SENT>
