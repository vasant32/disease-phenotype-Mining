<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of the disease is about 1 in 20,000, with life expectancy severely reduced because of cardiovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As the underlying defect is unknown, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> diagnosis is based solely on clinical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Certain phenotypic features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> are also shared by other conditions, which may be genetically distinct entities although part of a clinical continuum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies have implicated fibrillin, a major component of elastin-associated microfibrils, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> aetiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genetic linkage analysis with random probes has independently localized the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> locus to chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here we report that these two experimental approaches converge with the cloning and mapping of the fibrillin gene to chromosome 15q15-21, and with the establishment of linkage to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also isolated a second fibrillin gene and mapped it to chromosome 5q23-31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We linked this novel gene to a condition, congenital contractural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo>, that shares some of the features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, the cosegregation of two related genes with two related syndromes implies that fibrillin mutations are likely to be responsible for different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> phenotypes </plain></SENT>
