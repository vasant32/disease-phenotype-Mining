<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elastin concentration of the specimens was also estimated by hot alkali extraction followed by nitrogen determination of the extracted material and the insoluble residue </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> had low aortic elastin concentration determined by both methods </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aortic samples were studied from five patients who did not have the classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients of those five had decreased aortic elastin concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The change in elastin concentration was accompanied by high <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18095">hydroxyproline</z:chebi>/proline or hydroxylysine/lysine ratios which indicates that the proteins of the aneurysmatic aortic wall contained more collagen than the proteins of the control aortic wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings point to a change in the structure or metabolism of elastin in the aortic wall in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and at least in some other patients with annulo-aortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
