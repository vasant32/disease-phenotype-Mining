<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aortic pathology requiring aortic root replacement was annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> in 59 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in 5, and progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0005111'>dilatation of the ascending aorta</z:hpo> after aortic valve replacement in 2 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The operative techniques used were the Bentall technique in 36 operations, the Cabrol technique in 21, the aortic button technique in 3, and other miscellaneous techniques in 9 </plain></SENT>
