<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic dissection</z:hpo> seems to occur with increased frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To describe in more detail <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> as encountered in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Turner's syndrome</z:e>, giving attention to clinical, histological and epidemiological aspects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on a retrospective study, we describe the clinical, karyotypic, and epidemiological aspects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> as encountered in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Turner's syndrome</z:e> seen in Denmark and Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in 18 women was 35 years, ranging from 18 to 61 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of 18 women had a 45,X karyotype, while 2 patients had 45,X/45,XY, and 2 had the 45,X/46,X+r(X) complement, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography was performed in 10 of 18 patients before their <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> illness, and showed signs of congenital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e>, with either bifoliate aortic valves, dilation of the aortic root, or previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001680'>aortic coarctation</z:hpo> evident in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 5 patients evidence of a bifoliate aortic valve was conclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was present in 5 of 18 patients, while 10 of the patients died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, of so-called type A in 6, type B in 3, while in the final case the origin of dissection could not be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Biochemical analysis showed altered ratio between type I and type III collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histology showed cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in 3 of 7 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We estimated an incidence of dissection of 36 per 100,000 Turner's syndrome years, compared with an incidence of 6 per 100,000 in the general population, and a cumulated rate of incidence of 14, 73, 78, and 50 per 100,000 among 0-19, 20-29, 30-39, and 40+ year olds, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic dissection</z:hpo> is extremely common in the setting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Turner's syndrome</z:e>, and occurs early in life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Turner's syndrome</z:e> should be offered a protocol for clinical follow-up similar to that provided for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and each clinic should embrace a programme for follow-up </plain></SENT>
