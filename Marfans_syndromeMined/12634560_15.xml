<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To characterize and analyze the challenges of surgical correction for spinal deformity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and to present recommendations that may reduce morbidity and increase success for these procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: <z:hpo ids='HP_0008443'>Spinal deformities</z:hpo> are common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and usually refractory to conservative management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The few, smaller studies of surgical intervention reported on earlier surgical techniques but suggested increased complication rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Records and radiographs of 39 patients with confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who underwent surgical management at either of two institutions for primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> (n = 26), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> (n = 7), or deformity secondary to previous surgery elsewhere (n = 6) were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Presentation features, complications, and therapeutic results were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Low back outcome scores were generated from a questionnaire given to patients after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increased blood loss and rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (10%), dural tear (8%), instrumentation fixation failure (21%), pseudarthrosis (10%), and coronal (8%) and sagittal (21%) curve decompensation were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infection</z:e> was often associated with dural tear and decompensation with extreme correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient died of valvular insufficiency 11 weeks after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The cardiopulmonary condition of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> should be evaluated and planned for before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Preoperative computed tomograph to assess bony adequacy for fixation and magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> are indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Attention paid to the sagittal profile, extension of fusion to vertebrae neutral and stable in both planes, minimization of soft tissue dissection, and avoidance of extreme correction may prevent curve decompensation </plain></SENT>
