<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess changes in pulse wave velocity (PWV), a valid index of arterial stiffness, in patients undergoing endovascular repair (EVAR) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> (AAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Arterial stiffness is an independent marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-eight consecutive male patients (mean age 71±4 years) underwent elective EVAR (AAA group) after exclusion of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> or other collagen-related disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one age-matched men (mean age 69±5 years) without overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PWV and clinical parameters were determined at baseline in both groups and after 6 months in the AAA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, the groups did not differ in demographic characteristics, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, or blood pressure levels (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PWV was considerably higher in AAA than controls (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PWV positively correlated with mean blood pressure, AAA diameter, and age in univariate and multivariate analysis (R(2)=0.498, p=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 6 months after EVAR, PWV significantly increased from 13.11±3.57 m/s to 16.41±2.33 m/s (p&lt;0.001) in the AAA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with AAA present with significantly elevated PWV levels compared to controls, and stent-graft repair is associated with a significant increase in the PWV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Whether those changes contribute to the cardiovascular risk in AAA patients needs further investigation </plain></SENT>
