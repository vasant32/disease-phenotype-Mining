<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ink was not distributed in the area distal to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151814" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary occlusion</z:e> by AARP but well distribution in the same area by RCSP or RRAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The right ventricular wall and ventricular septum were poorly perfused by RCSP but well perfused by RRAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During cardiopulmonary bypass, RRAP created a fairly rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> and satisfactory myocardial cooling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During Perfusion, the right heart was somewhat dilated but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 10 canine hearts rebeat well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The left and right ventricular ejection fraction showed no significant change after bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No marked myocardial ultrastructural injury was found in left and right ventricles at the end of 90 minutes' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>4 patient, 1 of whom had 162 minutes' aortic cross-clamping received RRAP in operations on ascending aorta or coronary arteries and the myocardial protect ion was satisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No complication was found pertaining to RRAP </plain></SENT>
