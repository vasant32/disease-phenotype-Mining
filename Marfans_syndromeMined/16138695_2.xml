<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to characterize and determine the frequency of cardiovascular alterations by echocardiography in 2 age cohorts of Mexican patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and their comparisons with control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty six with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and 33 control patients were evaluated by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Segments of the aorta and pulmonary artery were measured at different levels, cardiac valves were examined for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> and the interatrial septum was assessed for septal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Numeric values were corrected for the body surface area and compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean significant values between group I (children) and Group II (adults) were as follows: aortic annulus 16.62 +/- 4.57 mm/m2 vs 12.81 +/- 1.95 (p &lt; 0.001), aortic root 23.30 +/- 7.49 mm/m2 vs 18.36 +/- 2.97 (p &lt; 0.001), sinuses of Valsalva 24.14 +/- 7.29 mm/m2 vs 19.84 +/- 3.59 (p &lt; 0.001), ascending aorta 18.43 +/- 5.90 mm/m2 vs 17.02 +/- 4.79 (p &lt; 0.001), aortic arch 16.12 +/- 4.73 mm/m2 vs 14.20 +/- 2.68 (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0006129'>Pulmonary valve prolapse</z:mp> was seen in 10/22 (45.5%) vs 7/44 (15.9%), p &lt; or = 0.03 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interatrial septal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was found in 3/22 (13.6%) vs 20/44 (45.5%), p &lt; or = 0.03 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significative diference in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo> between the adult group and control group (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001626'>cardiovascular abnormalities</z:hpo> in our series is similar to that in the literature with the exception of the very high incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0006129'>pulmonary valve prolapse</z:mp> vs control groups, then it suggests that the clinical manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> are strikingly severe in the Mexican population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Also a high incidence of interatrial septal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (34.9%) in comparison to control groups (18.2%) was found </plain></SENT>
