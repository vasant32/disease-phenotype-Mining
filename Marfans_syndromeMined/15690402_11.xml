<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to characterize the clinical symptoms associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and to understand the effects of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> on the overall health of affected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two volunteers aged 9-55 years with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> diagnosed by MRI or CT, filled out a "symptoms" questionnaire and completed an SF-36 health survey </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on our findings, a "classic" picture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> in the Marfan patient may consist of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003419'>low back pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, proximal leg pain, <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and numbness above and below the knee, and genital/rectal pain </plain></SENT>
