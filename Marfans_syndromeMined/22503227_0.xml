<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, some patients develop ABAD in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, we sought to characterize ABAD patients who presented with a descending thoracic aortic diameter &lt;3.5 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We categorized 613 ABAD patients enrolled in the International Registry of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic Dissection</z:hpo> from 1996 to 2009 according to the aortic diameter &lt;3.5 cm (group 1) and â‰¥3.5 cm (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographics, clinical presentation, management, and outcomes of the two groups were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 21.2% (n = 130) had an aortic diameter &lt;3.5 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients in group 1 were younger (60.5 vs 64.0 years; P = .015) and more frequently female (50.8% vs 28.6%; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They presented more often with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (10.9% vs 5.9%; P = .050), history of catheterization (17.0% vs 6.7%; P = .001), and coronary artery bypass grafting (9.7% vs 3.4%; P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> was equally distributed in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall in-hospital mortality did not differ between groups 1 and 2 (7.6% vs 10.1%; P = .39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: About one-fifth of patients with ABAD do not present with any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These patients are more frequently females and younger, when compared with patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This report is an initial investigation to clinically characterize this cohort, and further research is needed to identify risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
