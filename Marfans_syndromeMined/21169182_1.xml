<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: several studies have documented increased aortic stiffness in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) using echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have also shown primary myocardial impairment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether left ventricular (LV) function could be further impaired when acting against a stiff vascular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: twenty-six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients (mean age 30 Â± 2 years, 17 males) and 30 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mitral annular displacement, as a surrogate for LV systolic function, was evaluated from septal, anterolateral, anterior and inferior regions using M-mode and tissue Doppler imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Septal/anterolateral and anterior/inferior M-mode displacement measurements were normalised by dividing them by the longitudinal inner distance obtained at end diastole from the 4- and 2-chamber views, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Carotid-femoral and carotid-radial (CF and CR) pulse wave velocities (PWV) were determined using an automated applanation tonometry device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Central aortic pressure was assessed by recording radial waveforms with the tonometer and central waveforms were reconstructed using a generalised transfer function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CF- and CR-PWV were significantly increased in the patient group (p&lt;0.001), whilst mitral annular displacement measurements were significantly reduced (p&lt;0.001, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis demonstrated that the disease status and CF-PWV were strongly associated with reduced LV systolic function (p&lt;0.001, p=0.002, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: our study showed reduced LV systolic function and increased aortic stiffness in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The efficiency of a fibrillin-1 deficient heart may be further reduced by ejection into a stiff vascular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Care should be taken to ensure that any treatment regime addresses both increased aortic stiffness and myocardial dysfunction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
