<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Connective tissue pulleys serve as functional mechanical origins of the extraocular muscles (EOMs) and are normally stable relative to the orbit during gaze shifts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated pulley stability in incomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000486'>strabismus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Contiguous 2- or 3-mm thick magnetic resonance images (MRIs) perpendicular to the orbital axis spanned the anteroposterior extents of 12 orbits of six patients with incomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000486'>strabismus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Imaging was performed in central gaze, supraduction, infraduction, abduction, and adduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rectus EOM paths were defined by their area centroids and plotted in a normalized, oculocentric coordinate system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Paths of EOMs ran toward the pulleys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sharp EOM path inflections in secondary gaze indicated pulley locations in three dimensions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MRI revealed substantial inferior shift of the lateral rectus (LR) pulley of up to 1 mm during vertical gaze shifts in patients with axial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011003'>high myopia</z:hpo> and a posterior shift from abduction to adduction in simulated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brown syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was substantial LR pulley shift opposite the direction of vertical gaze in a subject with X-pattern <z:hpo ids='HP_0000577'>exotropia</z:hpo> who had undergone repeated LR surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The medial rectus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) pulley shifted inferiorly with gaze elevation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pulley instability was associated with significantly increased globe translation during gaze shifts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pulley instability, resulting in EOM sideslip during ductions, occurs in some cases of incomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000486'>strabismus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Resultant patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000486'>strabismus</z:hpo> may depend on static pulley positions, pulley instability, and coexisting globe translation that alters pulley locations relative to the globe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Translational instability of pulleys and the globe could produce abnormalities in actions of otherwise <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> EOMs, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> causing these instabilities should be considered as potential causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000486'>strabismus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
