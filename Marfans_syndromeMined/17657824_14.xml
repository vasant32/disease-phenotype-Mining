<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Starting with genomic DNA, we analysed the FBN1 gene using PCR, SSCP and/or dHPLC analysis, and automatic sequencing of abnormal bands/peaks, in a consecutive series of 508 patients, of which 22 were children less than 5 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results are comparable with those reported by other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we observed 193 mutations, 126 of which previously unreported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 331 relatives (including 51 infants) of 120 probands for whom a family mutation had been identified here or elsewhere, were tested for the presence of that particular mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, 4 prenatal tests were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The identification of a mutation allows for early diagnosis, prognosis, genetic counselling, preventive management of carriers and reassurance for unaffected relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The importance of knowing in advance the location of the putative family mutation is highlighted by its straightforward application to prenatal and postnatal screening </plain></SENT>
