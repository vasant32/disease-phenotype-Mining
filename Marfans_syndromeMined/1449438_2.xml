<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complications are relatively uncommon, but false associations due to ascertainment bias have had a potential for iatrogenic harm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adverse outcomes which do occur in a subset of MVP subjects are considered here in relation to the contributions of genes, gender and geometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There are definite associations between MVP and several dominantly inherited connective tissue abnormalities; it occurs in 85% of adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these contribute to a very small proportion of the MVP population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A larger less easily characterised group with dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> and some features of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> awaits DNA studies for identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For most MVP subjects our data define significant family aggregation consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010982'>polygenic inheritance</z:hpo>; the likelihood of a first degree relative having MVP is about two and a half times the population average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There is a higher prevalence in young women than in men-5% versus 3%; this has also been demonstrated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026267" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PMV">floppy mitral valve</z:e> (MV) at autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MVP complications of chordal rupture, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> and infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> are, however, two to three times more common in men, are age related and evident after the age of 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Higher blood pressure in men may contribute to this in accordance with a response-to-injury hypothesis to explain progressive valve changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Leaflet, annulus and left ventricular size differences and septal changes are geometric variants with a potential for increasing tension-related valve injury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
