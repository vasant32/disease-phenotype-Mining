<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The presence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> (PE) requiring surgical repair is a major skeletal feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Marfanoid patients have phenotypic findings but do not meet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to examine the clinical and management differences between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> patients and those who are marfanoid compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other patients undergoing minimally invasive PE repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective institutional review board-approved review was conducted of a prospectively gathered database of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent minimally invasive repair of PE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were grouped according to diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (MAR), Marfanoid appearance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OID</z:e>), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> others (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient demographics, preoperative imaging and testing, operative strategy, complications, and postoperative surveys were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fisher's Exact test and chi(2) were applied for statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From June 1987 to September 2008, 1192 patients underwent minimally invasive PE repair (MAR = 33, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OID</z:e> = 212, ALL = 947) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly higher proportion of females with either MAR or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OID</z:e> who underwent repair (21.5%vs 15.5%, P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The MAR patients had significantly more severe PE determined by computed tomography index (MAR = 8.75, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OID</z:e> = 5.82, ALL = 4.94, P &lt; .0001) and required multiple pectus bars (&gt; or =2) to be placed during operation (MAR = 58%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OID</z:e> = 36%, ALL = 29%, P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a trend toward higher wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rates in MAR patients (MAR = 6%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OID</z:e> = 1.4%, ALL = 1.3%, P = .07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The recurrence rate was similar among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups (MAR = 0%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OID</z:e> = 2%, ALL = 0.7%, P = .12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Successful outcome from surgeon perspective in either MAR or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OID</z:e> patients was similar to ALL (98%vs 98%, P = .88) and correlated well with patient satisfaction after repair (96%vs 95%, P = .43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive PE repair is safe in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> or marfanoid features with equally good results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> have clinically more severe PE requiring multiple bars for chest repair and may have slightly higher wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients are satisfied with minimally invasive repair despite a phenotypically more severe chest wall defect </plain></SENT>
