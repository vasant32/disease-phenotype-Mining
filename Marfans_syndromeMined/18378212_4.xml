<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To explore the utility of keratometry and central corneal thickness (CCT) measurements in diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective chart review of 211 patients referred for ocular examination to rule out <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were categorized into Marfan or control groups using current clinical diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients in whom <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> could be neither diagnosed nor ruled out were categorized as inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0810058" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">other connective tissue diseases</z:e> were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T tests were performed on keratometry and CCT values, and odds ratios (ORs) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were in the Marfan group and 98 patients were in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean age of the Marfan group was 22.3 years vs 19.3 years in the control group (P = .23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Marfan patients had significantly lower keratometry and CCT values than controls (40.8 diopters (D) [Marfan] vs 43.3 D [control], P = 4.0 x 10(-19); and 543.5 microm [Marfan] vs 564.2 microm [control], P = 9.1 x 10(-6)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The maximum OR for keratometry (17.6) was calculated at 42 D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo>, these values were 41.5 D (P = .00026 vs control) and 542.0 microm (P = .0011 vs control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There was a highly significant difference in keratometry values between Marfan and control patients, and values less than 42 D could be used as a clinical diagnostic criterion for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Significant overlap in CCT values between Marfan and control patients suggests that further investigation is necessary to determine the clinical utility of CCT measurements </plain></SENT>
