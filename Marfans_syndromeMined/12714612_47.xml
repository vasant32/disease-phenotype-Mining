<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To map the gene(s) associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> (AD) high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A multigeneration English/Canadian family with AD <z:hpo ids='HP_0011003'>severe myopia</z:hpo> was ascertained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Myopes were healthy, with no clinical evidence of syndromic disease, anterior segment abnormalities, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The family contained 22 participating members (12 affected) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average age of diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo> was 8.9 years (range, birth to 11 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">refractive error</z:e> for affected adults was -13.925 D (range, -5.50 to -50.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite markers for genotyping were used to assess linkage to several candidate loci, including three previously identified AD <z:hpo ids='HP_0011003'>high-myopia</z:hpo> loci on 18p11.31, 12q22-q23, and 7q36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo> linkage was excluded by using intragenic or flanking markers for Stickler syndrome types 1, 2, and 2B; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e> type 4; and juvenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A full genome screening was performed, with 327 microsatellite markers spaced by 5 to 10 cM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two-point linkage was analyzed using the FASTLINK program run at 90% penetrance and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo> gene frequency of 0.0133 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Linkage to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> candidate loci was excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The genome screening yielded a maximum two-point lod score of 3.17 at theta = 0 with microsatellite marker D17S1604 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Fine mapping and haplotype analysis defined the critical interval of 7.71 cM at 17q21-22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A novel putative disease locus for AD high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo> has been identified and provides additional support for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> for this disorder </plain></SENT>
