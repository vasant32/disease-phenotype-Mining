<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Today there is still debate concerning the optimal mode of treatment for type B dissection of the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Controversies are mainly due to discordant results regarding survival following medical or surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the early and long-term outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection of the descending aorta after initial conservative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1980 and 1995, 225 patients were hospitalized in the medical or surgical department of our institution with the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>38 patients (16.8%) underwent replacement of the descending aorta within the first week after hospital admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary indications for immediate surgery were rupturing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in 15 patients, extensive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the descending aorta in 13, distal malperfusion in 8, and pseudocoarctation syndrome with uncontrollable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other patients (n = 187) underwent primary conservative treatment in the intensive care unit, which included appropriate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hospital mortality during and after initial conservative treatment was 17.6% (33/187 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Main causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were rupture in 14 patients, intestinal malperfusion in 13 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> in 3, whereas in 3 patients the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> could not be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nine additional patients had to be referred for early surgery during the initial hospitalization because of contained rupture (n = 4), rapidly increasing size of the aorta (n = 2) and suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0156149" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal ischemia</z:e> (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hospital mortality after early surgery was 21% (8/38 patients) for the overall time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After hospital discharge from the initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection, surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection was performed in 47 patients, mainly because of expanding <z:hpo ids='HP_0004954'>descending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Hospital mortality was 8% in these patients (4/47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival rates after primary conservative therapy were 76 +/- 5% and 50 +/- 7% after 5 and 8 years respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Currently, surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type B dissection is limited to patients with rupturing disease, distal malperfusion or uncontrollable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and pains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Despite aggressive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment, hospital mortality after primary conservative treatment is still high and a substantial proportion of patients requires surgery during initial hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Although conservative treatment is recommended in most uncomplicated type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo>, early surgery should be considered in the following situations: younger patients with 5 cm diameter of the aorta at initial evaluation, as well as those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, patients with limited false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> or retrograde dissection into the aortic arch, and those with poor medical compliance or uncontrollable proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Radiographic follow-up for an indefinite period may allow detection of potential late complications and proper planning of elective operations when indicated </plain></SENT>
