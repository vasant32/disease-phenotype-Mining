<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To clarify the merits of various surgical approaches, we studied the outcome after composite valve graft versus separate valve and graft replacement versus conservative valve treatment with replacement of the ascending aorta in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1967 and 1999, 123 patients (mean age 56 +/- 15 years) underwent composite valve graft replacement (n = 21), separate valve and graft replacement (n = 20), or conservative valve treatment (n = 82 [commissural resuspension in 46]); follow-up averaged 6.5 years (95% complete) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 30-day, 1-year, and 6-year survival estimates of 85% +/- 4%, 79% +/- 5%, and 69% +/- 5% (+/-1 standard error of mean), respectively, after conservative valve treatment were similar to 86% +/- 8%, 81% +/- 9%, and 65% +/- 16%, respectively, with composite valve graft replacement and better (but insignificantly so) than 70% +/- 10%, 70% +/- 10%, and 45% +/- 11%, respectively, with separate valve and graft replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 6-year freedom from proximal reoperation was 95% +/- 3%, 89% +/- 10%, and 100% in conservative valve graft, separate valve and graft, and composite valve graft subgroups, respectively (P = not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox regression multivariable analysis identified that previous sternotomy (hazard ratio [or e(beta)] 95% confidence interval 1.4-10.9, P =.006), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (0.99-2.9, P =.05), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac tamponade</z:e> (1.1-4.0, P =.03), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (1.7-7.0, P =.001) increased the hazard of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No factors predicting a higher likelihood of late proximal reoperation were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, there was no significant difference in overall survival or reoperation rates among these surgical approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We try to save the valve whenever possible unless the aortic root is pathologically dilated (eg, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> or annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath>) or destroyed by the dissection process, when composite valve graft or valve-sparing aortic root replacement is indicated </plain></SENT>
