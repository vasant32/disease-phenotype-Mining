<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate binocular function (BF) and changes in axial length (AL) bilaterally in pseudophakic eyes of children after lensectomy and scleral fixation of an intraocular lens (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e>) for nontraumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 15 children who had undergone bilateral lensectomy and scleral fixation of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e> for nontraumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo>, AL was measured preoperatively and at last follow-up, and BF was assessed at last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Axial growth was compared with the expected and observed patterns of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> eyes, and the results were compared between patients with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> and those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten of the 15 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean age at surgery was 5.2 +/- 2.4 years; mean follow-up was 51.7 +/- 29.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A mean axial growth rate of 0.39 mm/year during 51.7 postoperative months was greater than the expected (0.07 mm/year) or the observed (0.09-0.24 mm/year) rates in age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The axial growth rates in isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> patients and Marfan patients were not significantly different (P = 0.159) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Binocular fusion and stereoacuity of &lt; or =800 seconds of arc were achieved by nine patients, and worse or no BF was achieved by the remaining six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These six patients were significantly more likely to have pre- or postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003081" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anisometropia</z:e> of &gt; or =3.0 D (66.6%) than the other nine patients (0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Because of greater than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> axial growth, more undercorrection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e> power is required than is usual in bilateral surgery for nontraumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Good or moderate levels of postoperative BF were achieved in more than half of patients </plain></SENT>
