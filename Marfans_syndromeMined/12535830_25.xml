<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We sought to assess outcomes in a series of young patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and to define the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in this patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: While <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> is a well-recognized outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> are not well described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were followed with echocardiography, electrocardiography, and ambulatory electrocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence and associated factors for ventricular dysrhythmias were defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> diagnosed at birth to 52 years were followed for a period of up to 24 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had cardiovascular involvement and were started on medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patient died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, while 4% died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>Ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> were present in 21% and were associated with increased left ventricular size, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, and abnormalities of repolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac complications are rare in young patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> receiving medical therapy and close clinical follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>Sudden death</z:hpo> still occurs, and appears more common in patients with a <z:mp ids='MP_0002753'>dilated left ventricle</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002753'>Left ventricular dilation</z:mp> may predispose to alterations of repolarization and fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
