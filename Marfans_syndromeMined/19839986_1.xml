<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to establish a national database of mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene that cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) in the Taiwanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we screened 294 patients from 157 families for the presence of FBN1 mutations using polymerase chain reaction/ denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (PCR/DHPLC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified 56 mutations in 62 of the 157 (40%) families including 49 single-base substitutions (36 missense mutations, seven nonsense mutations, and six splicing sites), one small insertion, four small deletions, one small indel (insertion and deletion), and one exonic deletion (Exon 36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When family history was taken into consideration, the mutation detection rate rose to 91% (29 of 32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We further investigated the phenotypic data and found that one third (47 of 157) of the families fit the Ghent criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on that data, the mutation rate was 98% (46/47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>That finding implies that family history and the Ghent criteria play a more important role than clinical manifestations in establishing a clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 56 mutations found in this study, 40 (71%) have not been registered in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) or in the Universal Mutation Database (UMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the first study of the mutation spectrum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> in a cohort of patients in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The database is expected to considerably improve genetic counseling for and medical care of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> families </plain></SENT>
