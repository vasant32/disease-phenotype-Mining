<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reimplantation technique using the De Paulis Valsalva graft might improve late results of valve-sparing aortic root replacement by maintaining annular stability and re-creating sinuses that minimize leaflet stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective review was conducted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients at our institution who underwent valve-sparing aortic root replacement using the Valsalva graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical data were obtained from hospital and clinic charts and patient contacts; echocardiograms were analyzed for aortic root dimensions and valve function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between May 2002 and June 2005, 51 patients underwent valve-sparing aortic root replacement using the reimplantation technique with the Valsalva graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 33 +/- 15 years; 22% (11 of 51) were children, and 80% (41 of 51) were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary indication for surgery was root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preoperative mean root diameter was 5.0 +/- 0.5 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> was present in 67% (34 of 51), and 10% (5 of 51) had the newly described Loeys-Dietz syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no operative or late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, and no patient required reoperation for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At mean follow-up of 1.8 years, there were no episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Echocardiograms showed stability of the annulus and root dimensions on follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No patient had more than 0 to 1+ <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> or progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were in New York Heart Association class I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Valve-sparing aortic root replacement using the Valsalva graft and reimplantation technique has excellent early results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Preservation of valve competence is encouraging, but long-term results will determine whether the anatomic design of this aortic root prosthesis is superior for preservation of valve integrity </plain></SENT>
