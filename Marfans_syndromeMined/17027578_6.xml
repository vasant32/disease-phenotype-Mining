<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite their histologic similarities, the 2 diseases differ with regard to the location of maximal <z:mp ids='MP_0010574'>aortic dilation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic analysis of aortic dimensions was performed in children with MS, children who had <z:mp ids='MP_0010574'>aortic dilation</z:mp> in the setting of nonstenotic <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAVs</z:mp> (peak gradient &lt;16 mm Hg), and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on 25 patients with MS, 31 with <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAVs</z:mp>, and 65 controls were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAVs</z:mp> had greater dimensions at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> levels of the aortic root compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAVs</z:mp> also had greater dilation than those with MS at the level of the annulus and the ascending aorta, with dilation often extending cranially beyond the region of measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, patients with MS had more focal dilation at the sinuses of Valsalva compared with controls and patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAVs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, despite similar histologic abnormalities, the anatomic pattern of <z:mp ids='MP_0010574'>aortic dilation</z:mp> differs in children with MS and <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAVs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
