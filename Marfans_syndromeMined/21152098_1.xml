<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When neutralizing antibodies to TGF-β1 or the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> were used to reduce TGF-β1 signaling, muscle <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and function were restored in mouse models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan Syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of our studies was to identify additional agents that overcome the anti-myogenic effect of TGF-β1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A high-content cell-based assay was developed in a 96-well plate format that detects the expression of myosin heavy chain (MHC) in C2C12 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The assay was used to quantify the dose-dependent responses of C2C12 cell differentiation to TGF-β1 and to the TGF-β1 Type 1 receptor kinase inhibitor, SB431542 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirteen agents previously described as promoting C2C12 differentiation in the absence of TGF-β1 were screened in the presence of TGF-β1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-trans <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> and 9-cis <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> allowed a maximal level of C2C12 cell differentiation in the presence of TGF-β1; the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi> and 10 nM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> provided partial rescue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">Vitamin D</z:chebi> was a potent inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi>-induced myogenesis in the presence of TGF-β1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TGF-β1 inhibits myoblast differentiation through activation of Smad3; however, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> did not inhibit TGF-β1-induced activation of a Smad3-dependent reporter gene in C2C12 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">Retinoic acid</z:chebi> alleviated the anti-myogenic effect of TGF-β1 by a Smad3-independent mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With regard to the goal of improving <z:mp ids='MP_0000750'>muscle regeneration</z:mp> and function in individuals with muscle disease, the identification of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> is intriguing in that some <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26537">retinoids</z:chebi> are already approved for human therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26537">retinoids</z:chebi> also have well-described adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The quantitative, high-content assay will be useful to screen for less-toxic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26537">retinoids</z:chebi> or combinations of agents that promote myoblast differentiation in the presence of TGF-β1 </plain></SENT>
