<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microfibrils are constituents of elastic and oxytalan fibers that confer mechanical stability and limited elasticity to tissues, contribute to growth factor regulation, and play a role in tissue development and homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The microfibril core is made of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> fibrillin, of which three types are known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other concurring molecules are microfibril associated proteins (MFAPs) and microfibril associated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> (MAGPs); they, and other peripheral molecules, contribute to link microfibrils to elastin, to other extracellular matrix components and to cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fibrillinopathies are <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> due to mutations in fibrillin genes (FBN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most frequent is <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, caused by mutations in FBN-1 and involving primarily the cardiovascular, skeletal, ocular and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several mutations have been identified, which lead to alteration or reduction in the secretion or assembly of fibrillin molecules and to increased microfibril proteolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Marfan related disorders are associated with alterations of TGF-beta signaling that interfere with extracellular matrix formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Understanding the pathogenesis of Marfan and related syndromes requires advances in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> of the extracellular matrix and in turn can cast light on the roles of microfibrils and of extracellular matrix in general in organ formation and function </plain></SENT>
