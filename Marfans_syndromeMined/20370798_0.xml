<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate pulmonary function (PF) in patients with MS and relate it to thoracic cage abnormalities (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi>) and the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> during the spirometric exam (SE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A sample of 75 subjects (46 with MS) underwent clinical, anthropometric, echocardiographic, radiographic and PF evaluation; 51 subjects (33 with MS) had their electrocardiogram (ECG) information evaluated during PF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These individuals were matched and compared with a healthy control group (CG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume (FEV) in the first second (FEV(1)) in the patients with MS were significantly lower in comparison with the CG (p = 0.012 and 0.0006) and predicted values (p = 0.04 and 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis based on <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> revealed differences between patients with MS with two combined abnormalities (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> + pectus) in comparison with both the CG (p = 0.012 and 0.002) and patients without abnormalities (p = 0.05 and 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no differences regarding the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> during exertion on the SE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a correlation between clinical history, cardiovascular behavior and PF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PF is reduced in patients with MS, and deformities in the thoracic cage appear to contribute to this reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite the apparent structural alterations in the cardiovascular system in this population, exertion during the SE appears to be safe </plain></SENT>
