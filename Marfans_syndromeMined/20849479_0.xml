<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The cardiovascular manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) are the main causes of morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study describes the clinical and echocardiographic findings in a Mestizo-Mexican population affected by the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 166 patients previously diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> were recruited for the study, 114 of them underwent complete clinical history, with emphasis on Ghent nosology criteria, and transthoracic echocardiography, with 68 patients also undergoing transesophageal study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Major cardiovascular criteria from the Ghent nosology predominated in adults (P &lt; 0.0001), minor criteria in children (P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among pediatric patients, 83% had a New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class of I; however, 64% of the adult patients had an NYHA class â‰¥II, (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Corrected aortic echocardiographic measurements of both groups demonstrated statistically significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Children had a greater prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, while adults more frequently presented with aortic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven patients died during follow-up from aortic complications, one child and six adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on the data, we can conclude that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> in the Mestizo-Mexican population has a distinctly different clinical pattern in children and adults, and a graver prognosis in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> are significantly more likely, than children, to have <z:mp ids='MP_0010574'>aortic dilation</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, and fatal outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> are more likely, than adults, to present with asymptomatic mitral and tricuspid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral valve regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
