<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Optimal operative decision making in thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> requires accurate information on the risk of complications during expectant management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cumulative and yearly risks of rupture, dissection, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> before operative repair increase with increasing aortic size, but previous work has not addressed the impact of relative aortic size on complication rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our institutional database contains data on 805 patients followed up serially with thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Body surface area information was obtained on 410 patients (257 male, 153 female) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We calculated a new measure of relative aortic size, the "aortic size index," and examined its ability to predict complications in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increasing aortic size index was a significant predictor of increasing rates of rupture (p = 0.0014) as well as the combined endpoint of rupture, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, or dissection (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using aortic size index, patients were stratified into three risk groups: less than 2.75 cm/m2 are at low risk (approximately 4% per year), 2.75 to 4.24 cm/m2 are at moderate risk (approximately 8% per year), and those above 4.25 cm/m2 are at high risk (approximately 20% per year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that (1) thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> is a lethal disease, (2) relative aortic size is more important than absolute aortic size in predicting complications, and (3) a novel measurement of relative aortic size allows for the stratification of patients into three levels of risk, enabling appropriate surgical decision-making </plain></SENT>
