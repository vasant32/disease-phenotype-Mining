<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Data are scarce on aortic complications during pregnancy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective study on a large population (415 patients) followed up in our multidisciplinary out-patient clinic devoted to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Women over 18 years of age were divided into 2 groups: 85 had been pregnant (MFSP+) giving birth to 136 children through 160 pregnancies; 68 had not been pregnant (MFSP-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of aortic complication was compared between the 2 groups using a piecewise discrete-time model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In MFSP+, 7 aortic complications occurred during 160 pregnancies (4.4%) and 17 aortic complications occurred during 1870 years of follow-up out of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In MFSP-, 14 aortic complications occurred over 940 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pregnancy was associated with a 5 fold increase in risk of aortic complication, which did not translate into increased risk during life, suggesting that pregnancy may act as a revealer in women prone to aortic complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy is associated with a transient increased risk of aortic complication in the absence of specific care </plain></SENT>
