<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The optimal perfusion strategy during surgery of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of retrograde cerebral perfusion during hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> on short-term and long-term outcome in this specific patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1984 and 2005, 175 consecutive patients underwent repair of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three different surgical approaches were used: aortic cross-clamping without hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> in 50 (29%), hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> alone in 69 (39%), and hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> with supplemental retrograde cerebral perfusion in 56 (32%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Operative mortality was 18% +/- 3% (+/- 70% confidence interval), and adverse outcomes (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo>) occurred in 21% +/- 3% of patients (p = 0.97 between groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified valve replacement (p = 0.04), preoperative flow complications (p = 0.03), and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (p = 0.04) as predictors of operative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative dissection (p &lt; 0.001) and history of cerebrovascular disease (p = 0.02) were predictors for permanent neurologic deficit, and retrograde cerebral perfusion was shown to have a protective effect on transient neurologic deficits (p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier survival was 75% +/- 3% at 1 year (131 patients at risk), 63% +/- 4% at 5 years (87 patients at risk), and 49% +/- 4% at 10 years (48 patients at risk) and was independent of surgical approach (p = 0.37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Long-term survival was diminished with increased age (p &lt; 0.001), earlier operative year (p &lt; 0.001), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current investigation suggests improved neurologic recovery with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> and supplemental retrograde cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Operative mortality and long-term survival were comparable among groups </plain></SENT>
