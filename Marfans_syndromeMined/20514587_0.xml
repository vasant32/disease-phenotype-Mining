<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this case, the mitral valve replacement operation was performed with an on-pump beating heart technique without cross-clamping the aorta and via a right thoracotomy because of diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e> around the ascending aortic tube graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 44-year-old male patient had undergone a Bentall operation via a median sternotomy for annulo-aortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> 3 years ago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He was admitted to the hospital complaining of palpitation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transthoracic echocardiography revealed 4th degree <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mitral valve replacement was carried out through a right thoracotomy using an on-pump beating heart technique without cross clamping the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, mitral valve replacement with an on-pump beating heart technique via a right thoracotomy offers a safe approach when excessive dissection is required to place a cross-clamp to the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
