<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients comprised 24 males and 9 females with a mean age of 31.9 +/- 9.7 years (range, 18 to 54 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean diameter of the ascending aorta was 6.6 +/- 1.6 cm and that of the aortic root was 5.4 +/- 1.2 cm </plain></SENT>
