<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To evaluate the safety, reproducibility and pitfalls of an aortic valve re-implantation (AVRei) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From June 2005 to December 2008, 30 patients underwent aortic valve-sparing re-implantation with Gelweave Valsalva prosthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 66 +/- 7 years (range 47-81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean aortic root diameter was 49 +/- 6 mm (range 37-70) and 12 patients had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> more than 2+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were elective, except three who underwent surgery for type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and one had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Isolated aortic root replacement was performed in 26 patients, whereas hemiarch extension was required in four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the survivors underwent serial echocardiographic assessment for functional results and multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) for aortic root <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was one early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and one re-exploration for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients suffered from a perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and four required a pacemaker implantation because of a complete atrio-ventricular block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 12 +/- 10 months (range 1-42) with no late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, whereas freedom from reoperation was 100% and freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> 2+ or more was 96.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MDCT aortic root reconstruction showed a pseudo-normalization of the neo-sinuses of Valsalva mimicking the human <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aortic root <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: AVRei with Valsalva conduit is a well-tolerated procedure both in elective and emergency situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In well-selected patients, good functional and clinical results can be achieved, regardless of the cause of the aortic root disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Application of simple surgical manoeuvres allows durable clinical efficacy to be obtained without the risk of major complications </plain></SENT>
