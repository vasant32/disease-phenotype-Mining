<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a case in which <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> administration induced or exacerbated OSA in a 13-year-old male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that exacerbation of OSA by <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> was associated with an increase in upper airway collapsibility during sleep, and that this improved after cessation of hormone administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our data strongly suggest that the mechanism by which <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> administration may induce or exacerbate OSA is through an influence on neuromuscular control of upper airway patency during sleep </plain></SENT>
