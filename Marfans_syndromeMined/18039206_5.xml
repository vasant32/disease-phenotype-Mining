<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Evaluate aortic root preserving/sparing procedures for various pathologies associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysms</z:hpo>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic valve regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From the end of 1990 through end of 2004, 388 patients had aortic root preserving procedures (reimplantation 72, remodeling 77, tailoring 239) +/- leaflet repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively, in-house grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> was 1(+) in 58, 2(+) in 110, 3(+) in 101, and 4(+) in 66 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Concurrent leaflet repairs were done in 197 (50.8%, Cabrol/Trusler commissure stitch 158, leaflet plication 36, supracommissure stitch 42, leaflet resection and repair 16, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> repair 18, and debridement 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional procedures included arch repair in 227 (58%), coronary bypass in 83 (21.4%), elephant trunk in 33 (8.5%), and minimally invasive approach in 30 (7.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pathologies included dissection in 140 (36%; 86 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in 39 (10%), bicuspid valve in 78 (20%), and degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in 142 (36.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CLASS (Commissure, Leaflet, Annulus, Sinuses, Sinotubular) evaluation schema is described that is used for selecting either reimplantation, remodeling, or tailoring of the aortic root according to underlying pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hospital survival was 97.4% (378/388) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred in 4.6% (18/388, four permanent, [1%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On postoperative echocardiography, patients had either no (0) or 1(+) regurgitation (1(+)= 98);13 (3.4%) had 2(+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients (1%) required reoperation for aortic valve failure before discharge (two tailoring, one remodeling) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Excellent early results can be achieved by aortic root preserving procedures and concurrent aortic valve leaflet repairs when appropriately selected for a diverse class of pathologies </plain></SENT>
