<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To describe morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing the elephant trunk (ET) implantation as the first stage in the repair of their mega aorta and to assess determinants for the occurrence of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients undergoing an ET implantation between 1984 and June 2001 were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ET was implanted as an extension of an isolated aortic arch (1%), an aortic valve replacement+ascending aorta+arch (14%), a root replacement+ascending aorta+arch (37%) and an ascending aorta+arch (48%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indications for surgery were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (1%), an inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (3%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> post-dissection (31%) or degenerative (65%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> was present in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For cerebral protection, we used isolated deep hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> (7%), deep hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> combined with uni- or bilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion (18%) or isolated uni- or bilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion (75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Uni- and multivariate analysis was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hospital mortality was 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were cardiac in one, rupture of a remote <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in three, tamponade in one and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After multivariate analysis, no single factor emerged as a risk factor for hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Permanent and transient neurologic dysfunction occurred in 4 and 2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed the operative period before 1990 (P=0.029) and emergency (P=0.018) as significant factors for postoperative neurologic dysfunction; after stepwise logistic regression analysis, only emergent operation retained significance (P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001609'>hoarseness</z:hpo>, total <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> requiring pacemaker implantation and re-thoracotomy for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> occurred in 17, 2 and 30%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The first step in the repair of a mega aorta, the implantation of an ET, can be performed with a low mortality and an acceptable morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The risk of central neurologic damage is higher in emergency interventions </plain></SENT>
