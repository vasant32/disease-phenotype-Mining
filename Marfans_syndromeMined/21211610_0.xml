<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The International Registry of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic Dissection</z:hpo> (IRAD) database was queried for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type B dissection who had documentation of ascending thoracic aortic size at time of presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were categorized according to ascending thoracic aortic diameters ≤4.0, 4.1 to 4.5, and ≥4.6 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four hundred eighteen patients met inclusion criteria; 291 patients (69.6%) were men with a mean age of 63.2 ± 13.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ascending thoracic aortic diameter ≤4.0 cm was noted in 250 patients (59.8%), 4.1 to 4.5 cm in 105 patients (25.1%), and ≥4.6 cm in 63 patients (15.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with an ascending thoracic aortic diameter ≥4.6 cm were more likely to be men (p = 0.01) and have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (p &lt;0.001) and known <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> disease (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with an ascending thoracic aorta ≥4.1 cm, there was an increased incidence of surgical intervention (p = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In those with an ascending thoracic aorta ≥4.6 cm, the root, ascending aorta, arch, and aortic valve were more often involved in surgical repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with an ascending thoracic aorta ≤4.0 were more likely to have endovascular therapy than those with larger ascending thoracic aortas (p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in overall mortality or cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, ascending thoracic aortic enlargement in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> is common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although its presence does not appear to predict an increased risk of mortality, it is associated with more frequent open surgical intervention that often involves replacement of the proximal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Those with smaller proximal aortas are more likely to receive endovascular therapy </plain></SENT>
