<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To develop and apply efficient and reliable protocols for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi>) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Two mutation-specific protocols were developed, and the markers D15S1028, D15S992, D15S196, D15S576, D15S123, and D15S143 were used to set up four multiplex polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Research Center Reproduction and Genetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENT(S): Ten couples carrying mutations in the FBN1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION(S): Six <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi> protocols were developed for 10 couples, and 7 of them underwent a total of 16 clinical cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Amplification, allele drop-out (ADO), and contamination rates during the preclinical assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA analyses of blastomeres from embryos biopsied during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi> cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULT(S): Six different protocols were set up, with the main objective being to to use one protocol for several couples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 16 PGD cycles were performed, which resulted in the delivery of an unaffected boy and three ongoing pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION(S): The development of single-cell multiplex PCRs for linked markers and its use in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi> reduce the workload of the genetic diagnostic laboratory as well as the average waiting time for patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This approach also allows for the simultaneous and accurate detection of recombination, contamination, and ADO, thereby increasing the reliability of the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
