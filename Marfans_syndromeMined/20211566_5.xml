<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To treat dilated diameters at the aortic annular base and sinotubular junction while maintaining root dynamics, we propose a standardised and physiological repair approach to the surgical management of aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, consisting of root remodelling, cusp re-suspension and subvalvular aortic ring annuloplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From May 2003 to September 2009, 144 unselected patients with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> underwent remodelling with external subvalvular ring annuloplasty in 13 centres (21 surgeons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> (AI) &gt; or =grade 2 was present in 63.9% (92), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in 12.5% (18) and bicuspid valve in 22.9% (33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cusp repair was performed in 40.3% (58) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Valve repair was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Repair of cusp <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> was necessary in 58 patients, significantly more frequent in bicuspid (24/33, 72.7%) than in tricuspid (34/111, 30.6%) valves (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Operative mortality was 2.8% (four) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subvalvular ring implantation produced a significant annular base reduction from 27.6+/-2.5 mm to 20.5+/-2.6 mm (p&lt;0.01) without significant mean trans-valvular gradient (7.2+/-1.7 mmHg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During follow-up (median 2.2 years (0.75-4.4, maximum 6.25 years)), five patients died while eight required a re-operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six were operated on during our early experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Strategy for cusp re-suspension evolved over three operative periods, with a significant increase in the rate of cusp repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>From May 2003 to December 2006: eye balling evaluation (15/67 (22.4%)); from January 2007 to August 2008: alignment of cusp free edges (17/38 (44.7%)); and from September 2008 to September 2009: a two-step standardised repair consisting of alignment of cusp free edges and effective height re-suspension (26/39 (66.7%) p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Freedom from AI&gt; or =grade 2 was 91.3% (115) at the end of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Implantation of an external aortic ring provides a reproducible technique for aortic valve repair with satisfactory preliminary results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The ongoing CAVIAAR trial (Conservative Aortic Valve surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic Insufficiency</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysm</z:hpo> of the Aortic Root) will compare this standardised repair technique using an expansible aortic ring to mechanical valve replacement </plain></SENT>
