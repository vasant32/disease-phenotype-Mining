<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serious <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications requiring the administration of blood products, hemostatic drugs, and even repeat surgery are associated with considerable morbidity, mortality, and resource consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therapy with recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) may be an effective treatment strategy for patients with refractory <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report the successful use of rFVIIa for the treatment of intractable postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> repair in two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both patients, surgical reexploration was avoided, and the patients' clinical status was stabilized after the administration of rFVIIa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one patient, hemostasis was rapidly achieved within minutes, whereas hemostasis occurred gradually over several hours in the second patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Including our personal experience with the two cases, the use of rFVIIa has been reported in 20 patients who required CPB for cardiothoracic surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hemostasis was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 14 patients (70%), rapid hemostasis was achieved following a single dose of rFVIIa (mean dose, 57 microg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the remaining six patients, gradual hemostasis was achieved after a mean of 3.4 doses (mean cumulative dose, 225 microg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients (10%) were believed to have experienced thromboembolic complications after the administration of rFVIIa (one was fatal), and, in another patient, intracoronary <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was suspected but was not confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients experiencing postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications that are refractory to treatment with blood products, hemostatic agents, and/or repeat surgery, the use of rFVIIa may be considered </plain></SENT>
