<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: This study examines pedicle widths, laminar thicknesses, and scalloping values for lumbosacral spine elements in Marfan volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were made between these measurements and norms as well as measurements between Marfan patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine if the lumbosacral vertebral elements are altered in the patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Several abnormalities have been noted in Marfan lumbar spine, including pedicular attenuation and widened interpediculate distances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This may be due to abnormalities of growth or presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Given the large numbers of Marfan patients requiring spinal surgery and the high postoperative failure rate, better understanding of the bony <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of Marfan lumbar spine is necessary, especially if use of instrumentation is anticipated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-two volunteers with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> based on the Ghent criteria underwent spiral computed tomography of the lumbosacral spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Images were evaluated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo>, and measurements of pedicle width, laminar thickness, and vertebral scalloping were made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pedicle widths and laminar thicknesses were significantly smaller in Marfan patients at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> levels (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean pedicle widths at L1-L3 were smaller than the smallest available pedicle screw (5 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In Marfan patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo>, laminar thickness from L5-S2 and pedicle widths at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lumbar levels were significantly reduced (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Vertebral scalloping at S1 was significantly greater in Marfan patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Lumbar pedicle width and laminar thickness are significantly reduced in Marfan individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> demonstrate increased bony <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> of anterior and posterior elements of lumbosacral spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Preoperative planning and routine computed tomography scans are recommended when operating on Marfan lumbosacral spine </plain></SENT>
