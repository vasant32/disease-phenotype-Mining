<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although this appears to occur with a much lower prevalence and lesser severity than in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, the true prevalence of cardiac connective tissue involvement is not known, and the orthopedic complications of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029434" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteogenesis imperfecta</z:e> may have overshadowed attention to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001626'>cardiovascular abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In evaluating patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029434" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteogenesis imperfecta</z:e>, careful attention should be paid to cardiovascular findings and if valvular lesions are noted, patients should be instructed regarding the need for antibiotic prophylaxis for dental and surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The valvular lesions can progress, and regular follow-up cardiovascular evaluation should be planned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, despite potential problems with tissue friability and healing and a possible tendency for increased <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, successful valve replacement can be carried out if necessitated by cardiac disability </plain></SENT>
