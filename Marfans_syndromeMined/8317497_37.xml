<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a large family with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective-tissue disorder</z:e> that exhibits some of the skeletal and cardiovascular features seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, none of the 19 affected individuals displayed ocular abnormalities and therefore did not comply with recognized criteria for this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients could alternatively be diagnosed as MASS (mitral valve, aorta, skeleton, and skin) phenotype patients or represent a distinct clinical entity, i.e., a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective-tissue disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fibrillin genes located on chromosomes 15 and 5 are clearly involved in the classic form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and a clinically related disorder (congenital contractural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo>), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To test whether one of these genes was also implicated in this French family, we performed genetic analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were obtained for 56 family members, and four polymorphic fibrillin gene markers, located on chromosomes 15 (Fib15) and 5 (Fib5), respectively, were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Linkage between the disease allele and the markers of these two genes was excluded with lod scores of -11.39 (for Fib15) and -13.34 (for Fib5), at theta = .001, indicating that the mutation is at a different locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This phenotype thus represents a new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective-tissue disorder</z:e>, overlapping but different from classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
