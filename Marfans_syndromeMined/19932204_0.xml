<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report five cases in two unrelated families (one <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> case in the first family and three siblings and their father in the second family) with the same association of polyvalvular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, distinctive facial appearance, and, except the father in family 2, major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001382'>joint hypermobility</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in three of our patients (2 siblings and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> case), electron microscopy revealed characteristic ultrastructural <z:mp ids='MP_0002096'>skin abnormalities</z:mp> with abnormal amorphous or microfibrillar deposits under the capillary basal membrane in the papillary dermis, suggestive of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e>, but different from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
