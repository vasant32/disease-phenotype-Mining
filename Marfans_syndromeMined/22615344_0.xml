<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the natural evolution of this condition and predictive factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred eighty-four consecutive patients, 108 surgically treated type A and 76 medically treated type B, were discharged after an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> with patent false lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiography was performed before discharge, and computed tomography was performed at 3 months and yearly thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 6.42 years (quartile 1 to quartile 3: 3.31-10.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine patients died during follow-up (22 type A, 27 type B), 31 suddenly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgical or endovascular treatment was indicated in 10 type A and 25 type B cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Survival free from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> and surgical-endovascular treatment was 0.90, 0.81, and 0.46 (95% CI, 0.36-0.55) at 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified baseline maximum descending aorta diameter (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.32 [1.10-1.59]; P=0.003), proximal location (HR: 1.84 [1.06-3.19]; P=0.03), and entry tear size (HR: 1.13 [1.08-1.2]; P&lt;0.001) as predictors of dissection-related adverse events, whereas mortality was predicted by baseline maximum descending aorta diameter (HR: 1.36 [1.08-1.70]; P=0.008), entry tear size (HR: 1.1 [1.04-1.16]; P=0.001), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (HR: 3.66 [1.65-8.13]; P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic dissection</z:hpo> with persistent patent false lumen carries a high risk of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and aorta diameter, a large entry tear located in the proximal part of the dissection identifies a high-risk subgroup of patients who may benefit from earlier and more aggressive therapy </plain></SENT>
