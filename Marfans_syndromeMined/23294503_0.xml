<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Fibrillin-1 hypomorphic mice (mgR/mgR) are accepted as a model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic investigations of this mouse have not previously included quantification of phenotypic features and detailed examinations of the histopathology other than in the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We developed a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay to genotype the mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Necropsy was performed on 50 male mice after natural <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then sacrificed 10 mgR/mgR and 10 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice at 14-19 weeks to perform in vivo computed tomographic scans (n = 3) and microscopic examinations (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four aortic segments (ascending, descending, pararenal, and infrarenal aorta) were excised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each segment was divided into four subsegments and analyzed with Van Gieson staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of elastin breaks and internal aortic diameter were determined twice in randomized, blinded fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Computed tomographic scans of mgR/mgR mice revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation in the ascending aorta and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002751'>kyphoscoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306863" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Elastolysis</z:e> was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four aortic segments of mgR/mgR but was rarely observed in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the ascending aorta was larger in mgR/mgR than in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice (P = .01), but para- and infrarenal aortic diameter were even smaller in mgR/mgR mice (P &lt; .001 and P = .01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Exploratory gene expression analysis showed a number of differentially expressed genes with overrepresentation of immune-related functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed upregulation of selected genes in both the ascending aorta and the abdominal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that mgR/mgR mice could be a useful model to study aortic abnormalities in segments other than the ascending aorta in order to understand the molecular mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
