<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Cardiothoracic surgery unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1986 and January 2002, 72 patients (mean age 58.3 +/- 12.4 years, 81.9% males) underwent ARR by means of a Bentall operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> was the most frequent cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> in this series of patients (31 patients; 43.1%), followed by type A dissection (19 patients; 26.3%), atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (18 patients; 25.1%), and poststenotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> (4 patients; 5.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (12.5%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and 10 patients (13.8%) underwent a concomitant replacement of the aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up ranged from 2 to 192 months (mean [+/- SD], 86.6 +/- 23.8 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean 30-day mortality rate was 5.5 +/- 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean early mortality rate was 21 +/- 4% and 0% (p &lt; 0.001), respectively, in patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002622'>dissecting aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were two late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> that were due to a pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean 16-year survival rate was 91.7 +/- 3.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean hazard of freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was constant beyond 3 years (8.5 +/- 3.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No patient required reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the long-term clinical follow-up was marked by a complete absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>-related <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, valve <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and prosthesis failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Finally, patients showed a significant improvement in mean New York Heart Association functional status (1.3 +/- 0.1; p &lt; 0.001 [postoperatively vs preoperatively]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, the late results of the Bentall operation were satisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Our findings confirm that this technique still represents the procedure of choice for ARR with coronary reimplantation </plain></SENT>
