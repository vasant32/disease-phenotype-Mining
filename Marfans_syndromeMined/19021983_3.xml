<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze the results of distal aortic reoperations in Marfan patients after proximal aortic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 95 Marfan patients (56 male; mean age 34.5 +/- 10.9 years) have been followed or operated on at our institution between October 1994 and December 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results of patients who required distal aortic reinterventions after root surgery were collected and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen Marfan patients (9 male; mean age 39.1 +/- 7.5 years) underwent distal aortic reinterventions after aortic root surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The indications for distal reoperations consisted of dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> after type A dissection surgery in 12 patients (80%) and nondissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in 3 patients (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Type A dissection during initial aortic root surgery was the only independent predictor of distal aortic reoperation (hazard ratio 3.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient (6.7%) died perioperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurologic morbidity consisted of 1 patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> and 1 with temporary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002385'>paraparesis</z:hpo>, and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients died during a mean follow-up of 36.2 +/- 25.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Survival was 91.7% +/- 1.6% at 1 and 5 years postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three patients undergoing reoperative arch procedures required additional interventions on the distal aorta during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Distal aortic reoperations in Marfan patients are more common among those presenting with type A dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although technically challenging, such procedures can be performed with good short- and long-term results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Complete aortic arch replacement with an elephant trunk technique, if it can be safely performed, should be considered for Marfan patients presenting with type A dissection </plain></SENT>
