<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Debate as to whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> (AAA) are caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> or whether they have a strong genetic etiology continues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the hypothesis that risk factors are likely to be strongest in patients with generalized aneurysmal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We screened 232 consecutive AAA patients for popliteal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and investigated cardiovascular and genetic risk factors in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonography demonstrated the presence of a popliteal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in 24 of 232 (10%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified four independent factors associated with popliteal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>: age (p = 0.013), height (p = 0.017), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentration (p = 0.009), and systolic blood pressure (p = 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the AAA patients a significant association of fibrillin-1 genotype was present, determined by a tandem repeat polymorphism, with both systolic and pulse pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The genotypes associated with the highest pressures were significantly more common among the patients with popliteal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, p = 0.03 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following these findings we investigated whether there was an association between fibrillin-1 genotype and blood pressure in a healthy population, 245 men aged 50-61 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Again we found a significant association between fibrillin genotype and pulse pressure, p = 0.003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suggest that a strong interaction occurs between fibrillin genotype and blood pressure which contributes to the development of aneurysmal disease </plain></SENT>
