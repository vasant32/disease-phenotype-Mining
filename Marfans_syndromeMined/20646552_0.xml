<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impairment pattern and the influencing factors of pulmonary function in patients with Marfan and Marfanoid syndrome associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> (MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this retrospective study, totally 25 MS patients (aged 11 - 20 years, 11 boys and 14 girls) who received posterior instrumentation and fusion (Group A) and 38 adolescent idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> (AIS) patients (Group B) (aged 10 - 19 years, 11 boys and 27 girls) were included from February 1998 to September 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The curve pattern was matched in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The preoperative pulmonary function test (PFTs) were compared in two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>And the parameters influencing the preoperative pulmonary function were analyzed in group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In Group A, the Cobb angle of thoracic curve was negatively correlated with the percentage of predicted pulmonary volumes (VC%, FVC% and FEV1%) (r = -0.514, -0.503, -0.464, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>And the reduction of lung function parameters (VC%, FVC%, FEV1% and MMEF%) was more severe in Group A than in Group B with compared magnitude of thoracic curve (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Group A, the extent of impairment of pulmonary function in patients with the number of vertebrae involved ≥ 8 were more severe than those involved &lt; 8 vertebrae (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant difference of deterioration of lung function between the higher apex (T₄₋₈) subgroup and lower apex (T₉₋₁₂) subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>And no correlation was found between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002942'>thoracic kyphosis</z:hpo> and the degrees of impairment of respiration function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MS have mixed ventilation dysfunction, which is more severe than AIS patients with matched age and Cobb angle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The pulmonary dysfunction in MS patients can be influenced by the severity of thoracic curve and the number of involved vertebrae </plain></SENT>
