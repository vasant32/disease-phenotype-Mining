<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To extend our understanding of the proteins composing these microfibrils, the cDNA and gene encoding the human associated microfibril protein (MFAP1) have been cloned and characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The coding portion is contained in 9 exons, and the sequence is very homologous to the previously described chick cDNA, but does not appear to share homology or domain motifs with any other known protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the gene has been localized to chromosome 15q15-q21 by somatic hybrid cell and chromosome in situ analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is the same chromosomal region to which the fibrillin gene, FBN1, known to be defective in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, has been mapped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MFAP1 is a candidate gene for heritable diseases affecting microfibrils </plain></SENT>
