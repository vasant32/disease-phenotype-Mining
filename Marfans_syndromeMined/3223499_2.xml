<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The anomalies, including contractural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0008905'>rhizomelia</z:hpo> (a relative shortening of the proximal segment of the limbs), <z:hpo ids='HP_0010781'>skin dimples</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0006253'>clinodactyly</z:mp>, disharmonic hand bone maturation, absent, hypoplastic and unusually positioned digital and metacarpophalangeal flexion creases, are not indicative of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, but it is unclear what this syndrome constitutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the child's most striking dermatoglyphic features, the fingertip patterns (mostly large whorls with extralimital triradii) extend proximally to the middle phalanx and are associated with unusually placed triradii </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The furrows between the epidermal ridges are narrower on the volar aspects of the middle and distal phalanges than on the proximal phalanges and palms, resulting in a higher ridge density in the former areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dermatoglyphic comparisons between the proposita and her parents are provided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These dermatoglyphic aberrations may indicate the presence of a deleterious agent active during the period of the development of the ridge configurations and of the digital flexion creases </plain></SENT>
