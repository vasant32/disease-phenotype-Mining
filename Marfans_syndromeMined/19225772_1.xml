<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventeen patients with an identified mutation in FBN1 were examined for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with 17 age- and sex-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our images were also evaluated using the two methods of quantifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo>, namely those of Ahn et al. and of Oosterhof et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With our method, 80% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS1</z:e> patients and 7% controls fulfilled the criterion for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using the method of Oosterhof et al., <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> was found in 88% patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS1</z:e> and in 47% controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using the method of Ahn et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>76% patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and 29% controls showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We present a novel quantitative method of evaluating MRT images for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo>, which, in our own patient cohort, performed better than those previously described </plain></SENT>
