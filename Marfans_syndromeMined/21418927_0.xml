<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical effects and safety of the auxiliary management with iris retractor for subluxated lens combined with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-<z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eyes</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001132'>lens subluxation</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> come from 27 patients were reviewed, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them were 30 - 78 years old and III - IV grade of nuclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among these patients, 14 were traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataracts</z:hpo>, 12 Marfan syndromes, two over-mature phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataracts</z:hpo>, one caused suspensory ligament broken during phacoemulsification, and one unclear reason </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>1 to 4 iris retractors were used during surgeries, according to the extension of zonular loss and nuclear hardness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anterior vitrectomy would be taken if vitreous prolapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Visual acuities and reactions post-operative were observed, too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>And correlation analysis would be used to study the relationship of those objections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no serious complications during the surgeries such as tearing of capsular, falling of nuclear, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> of intraocular, and so on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 9 of 31 eyes (29.0%) had vitreous prolapsed interoperation, which appeared a significant correlated with range of zonular loss (Spearman r = 0.453, P = 0.010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, none of them happened during the phacoemulsification for lens nucleus and only 6 eyes took the anterior vitrectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The best corrected postoperative visual acuity of these patients attended to 0.2 - 1.2 at a half to 1 month, increased by 1 - 12 lines [average of (6.0 Â± 2.7) lines] compared with preoperative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three eyes visual acuity of them were no less than 0.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Corneal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> postoperatively appeared a significant correlated with vitrectomy (Spearman r = 0.398, P = 0.026), while seemed no associated with the range of zonular loss, the number of iris retractors, energy and duration of ultrasound burst or type of intraocular lens (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e>) (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Phacoemulsification assists with iris retractor can simplify the process of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> surgery of subluxated lens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Individualized surgical planning and flexible and decisive measures intra-operative achieved good results and well safety in these dangerous and complex <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023308" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lens diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
