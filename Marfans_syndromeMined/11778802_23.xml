<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aetiology of this condition is probably multifactorial, or it represents the final common pathway for a variety of different pathological processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although a familial history is present only in a minority of cases, one of the major aetiological factors is certainly genetic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is evidenced by: the condition's familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo>; its discordance between monozygotic and dizygotic twins; and its association with other known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> such as Down's and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the keratoconic cornea, a possible genetic predisposition to increased sensitivity to apoptotic mediators by keratocytes has also been hypothesized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences in prevalence between ethnic groups have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recent advances in computerized topographic diagnostic techniques for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000563'>keratoconus</z:hpo>, including forme fruste <z:hpo ids='HP_0000563'>keratoconus</z:hpo>, enables higher accuracy in delineating abnormal from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and helps define study populations for genetic linkage studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> and the phenotypic diversity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000563'>keratoconus</z:hpo> means that genetic analysis continues to be a complex process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None the less, it is foreseeable that over the next decade, improved diagnostic techniques, in combination with molecular genetics, may reveal conclusive data on the precise nature of the genetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000563'>keratoconus</z:hpo> in specific populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This review considers the evidence that suggests <z:hpo ids='HP_0000563'>keratoconus</z:hpo> is primarily an inherited condition, and examines research strategies aimed at unveiling the genetic predisposition, and the enigma of environmental influences on its phenotypic expression </plain></SENT>
