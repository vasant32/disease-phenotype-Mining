<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We wanted to investigate the relationship between a mutation in this gene and risk of prevalent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, the effect of a G-A substitution in intron 27 in the fibrillin-1 gene (rs11856553) on risk of prevalent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was studied in two large population-based studies: the Health 2006 study, consisting of 3193 women and men, age 18-69 years, and the MONICA10 study, consisting of 2408 women and men, age 41-72 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 1646 MONICA10 participants, blood pressure (BP) was also measured by 24-h ambulatory recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 3193 Health 2006 participants 23 had the G-A variant, and among the 2408 MONICA10 participants 18 had the G-A variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Health 2006, the odds ratio estimate (95% confidence intervals) for the G-A variant for risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, defined as systolic (S) BP ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic (D) BP ≥ 90 mmHg or on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medicine, was 2.67 (1.14-6.18), p = 0.022 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The corresponding figure for moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, defined as SBP ≥ 160 mmHg or <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> ≥ 100 mmHg, was 9.68 (4.24-22.12), p &lt; 0.0001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In MONICA10, the odds ratio estimate (95% confidence intervals) for the G-A variant for risk of moderate to severe ambulatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, defined as 24-h mean SBP ≥ 150 mmHg or 24-h mean <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> ≥ 90 mmHg, was 5.73 (1.96-16.7), p = 0.0014 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The G-A substitution in the fibrillin-1 gene (rs11856553) is a rare genetic variant that is associated with an increased risk of prevalent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, particularly of moderate to severe prevalent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
