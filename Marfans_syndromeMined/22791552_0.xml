<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four disorders can now be ascribed to this group, namely <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265313" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Weill-Marchesani syndrome</z:e> (WMS), geleophysic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (GD), acromicric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (AD), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0796081" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Myhre syndrome</z:e> (MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although closely similar, they can be distinguished by subtle clinical features and their pattern <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>WMS is characterized by the presence of dislocation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1562061" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microspherophakia</z:e> and has <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> or recessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GD is the more severe one, with a progressive cardiac valvular thickening, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002777'>tracheal stenosis</z:hpo>, bronchopulmonary insufficiency, often leading to an early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AD has an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo>, distinct facial and skeleton features (a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001609'>hoarse voice</z:hpo> and internal notch of the femoral head) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, MS is <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo>, characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000303'>prognathism</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002684'>thickened calvarium</z:hpo>, and large vertebrae with short and large pedicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We first identified mutations in Fibrillin-1 (FBN1) in the dominant form of WMS and then mutations in A Disintegrin-like And Metalloproteinase domain with ThromboSpondin type 1 repeats 10 (ADAMTS10) in the recessive form of WMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The function of ADAMTS10 is unknown but these findings support a direct interaction between ADAMTS10 and FBN1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We then identified mutations in ADAMTSL2 in the recessive form of GD and a hotspot of mutations in FBN1 in the dominant form of GD and in AD (exon 41-42, encoding TGFβ binding protein-like domain 5 (TB5) of FBN1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The function of ADAMTSL2 is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Using a yeast double hybrid screen, we identified latent transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) binding protein 1 as a partner of ADAMTSL2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We found an increased level of active TGFβ in the fibroblast medium from patients with FBN1 or ADAMTSL2 mutations and an enhanced phosphorylated SMAD2 level, allowing us to conclude at an enhanced TGFβ signaling in GD and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Finally, a direct interaction between ADAMTSL2 and FBN1 was demonstrated suggesting a dysregulation of FBN1/ADAMTSL2 interrelationship as the underlying mechanism of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Using exome sequencing in MS probands, we identified de novo SMAD4 missense mutations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> involving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32615">isoleucine residue</z:chebi> at position 500, in the MH2 domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In MS fibroblasts, we found decreased ubiquitination level of SMAD4 and increased level of SMAD4 supporting a stabilization of SMAD4 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Functional SMAD4 is required for canonical signal transduction through the oligomerization with phosphorylated SMAD2/3 and SMAD1/5/8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>We therefore studied the nuclear localization of mutant SMAD complexes and found that the complexes translocate to the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>We finally observed a decreased expression of downstream TGFβ target genes supporting impaired TGFβ driven transcriptional control in MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Our findings support a direct link between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> phenotypes and the TGFβ signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>However, the finding of enhanced TGFβ signaling in Marfan phenotypes supports the existence of yet unknown mechanisms regulating TGFβ action </plain></SENT>
