<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical spectrum and severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> disorder varies greatly both between and within families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since there have been only a few reports on the relationship between FBN1 genotypes and clinical phenotypes in Japanese patients, the FBN1 gene was analyzed in 27 Japanese patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The nucleotide sequence of the 65 exons of the FBN1 gene was analyzed by PCR and direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have identified six polymorphisms and nine mutations including: four missense mutations (C1652Y, Q2054P, D2127Y, C2221R) in six patients, three nonsense mutations (R215X, S813X, R2220X) in three patients, and two frameshift mutations (2567insT, 7790insT) in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six of these nine mutations were in the calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like domains <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causative mutations detected except for C2221R were novel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that the severe phenotypes of infantile <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> correlate with mutations in the mid region of FBN1, however, mutations were not detected in this region in the population analyzed in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the location of the mutation is not the sole determinant of phenotypic severity; rather there is some difference in the genetic basis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> between Japanese and Caucasian populations </plain></SENT>
