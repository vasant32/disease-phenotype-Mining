<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Frequent observation of cattle with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> withers height, but lower body weight than age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cattle, was recently reported among cattle sired by phenotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Bull A, in Japanese Black cattle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These cattle also showed other characteristic features similar to the clinical phenotype of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, such as a long phalanx proximalis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000300'>oval face</z:hpo> and crystalline lens cloudiness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We first screened a paternal half-sib family comprising 36 affected and 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> offspring of Bull A using the BovineSNP50 BeadChip (illumina) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two microsatellite markers mapped to a significant region on BTA10 were subsequently genotyped on the family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The bovine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>-like disease (MFSL) was mapped onto BTA10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As FBN1 is located in the significant region, FBN1 was sequenced in Bull A, and three affected and one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cattle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A G&gt;A mutation at the intron64 splicing accepter site (c.8227-1G&gt;A) was detected in 31 of 36 affected animals (84.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The c.8227-1G&gt;A polymorphism was not found in 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> offspring of Bull A or in 93 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cattle unrelated to Bull A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mutation caused a 1-base shift of the intron64 splicing accepter site to the 3' direction, and a 1-base deletion in processed <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This 1-base deletion creates a premature termination codon, and a 125-amino acid shorter Fibrillin-1 protein is produced from the mutant <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We therefore conclude that the c.8227-1G&gt;A mutation is causative for MFSL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it was suggested that Bull A exhibited germline mosaicism for the mutation, and that the frequency of the mutant sperm was 14.9% </plain></SENT>
