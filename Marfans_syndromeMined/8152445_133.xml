<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aortic root enlarges progressively in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, and this enlargement is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> and dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Long-term treatment with beta-adrenergic blockade, by reducing the impulse (i.e., the rate of pressure change in the aortic root) of left ventricular ejection and the heart rate, may protect the aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted an open-label, randomized trial of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> in adolescent and adult patients with classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (32 treated and 38 untreated [control] patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aortic-root dimensions and clinical end points (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, cardiovascular surgery, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) were monitored for an average of 9.3 years in the control group and 10.7 years in the treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 70 patients were included in the analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The dose of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> was individualized; the mean (+/- SE) dose was 212 +/- 68 mg per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean slope of the regression line for the aortic-root dimensions, which reflect the rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, was significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group (0.023 vs. 0.084 per year, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical end points were reached in five patients in the treatment group and nine in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier survival curve for the treatment group differed significantly from that for the control group during the middle years of the trial and remained better for the treatment group throughout the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic beta-adrenergic blockade is effective in slowing the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> and reducing the development of aortic complications in some patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
