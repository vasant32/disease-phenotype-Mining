<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: An optimal treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000098'>tall stature</z:hpo> in boys in terms of efficacy and safety is not available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment with somatostatin analogue 201-995 (SMS) has been tried with positive short-term results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated the effect of SMS treatment on reducing adult height </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over 2 years, 16 boys presenting to our university hospital with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000098'>tall stature</z:hpo> (constitutional <z:hpo ids='HP_0000098'>tall stature</z:hpo> (n = 13), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (n = 2) and tethered spinal cord (n = 1)) with a predicted final height above 197 cm were included in the study and prospectively followed until final height was reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As one boy was lost to follow-up we have reported on 15 boys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with SMS as a single subcutaneous dose was started and continued until final height was reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In eight boys <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> were given to induce puberty after the start of SMS and five boys were on treatment with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> prior to SMS treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Effect on reduction of final height prediction, calculated with the index of potential height based on the bone age of Greulich and Pyle, was the main outcome measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Standard anthropometric assessments were performed a year before and every 3 months during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bone age was assessed by the method of Greulich and Pyle at the start and after 6 and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean reduction in final height prediction (predicted adult height minus achieved adult height) was -0.1 cm (range -6.4 to +5.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In three boys, asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333027" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microlithiasis</z:e> of the gall bladder was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have concluded that, in spite of encouraging short-term results, long-term treatment with SMS does not reduce final height in a manner sufficient to justify SMS treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000098'>tall stature</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
