<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Symptoms were severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and subsequent neurologic deficit in young persons (3 women, 4 men; mean age 35 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The underlying pathology was spontaneous dissection of the cervical internal carotid artery, with surgical confirmation in 3 cases and typical angiographic patterns in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous dissection of the cervical internal carotid artery is being increasingly recognized as a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover this clinicopathologic event is more common than had previously been supposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The etiology remains unclear, except in 15% of cases in which <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> of the media (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>) is in cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No history of cervical trauma can be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Typical clinical features consist in ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> preceding an abrupt neurologic deficit in a 40-year-old person </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An incomplete <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner syndrome</z:hpo> (oculosympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> without facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000970'>anhidrosis</z:hpo>) associated with facial pain and numbness is pathognomonic, but the majority of dissections are less typical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The typical angiographic pattern is an elongated regular stenosis of the high cervical internal carotid artery, 2 cm above the non-involved bulbus ("string sign") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The dissection may modify to a tapered occlusion above the point of origin of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The natural course is spontaneous resolution of the stricture, without relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Optimal management is non-operative since medical treatment has proved to be efficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These cases confirm the benign course and overall good prognosis of spontaneous dissections of the internal carotid artery which are not as rare as the scarcity of reports might indicate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
