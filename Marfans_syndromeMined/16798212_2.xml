<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Here we report our surgical experiences with aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSA) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight patients underwent surgical treatment for ARSA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> between March 1994 and June 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The age of these patients ranged from 20 to 75 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean size of the ARSA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was 3.3 cm, ranging from 2 to 5 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ARSA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was completely resected through a left posterolateral thoracotomy after reconstruction of the right subclavian artery through the supraclavicular approach in 4 patients (group 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ARSA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was excluded through a left posterolateral thoracotomy without revascularization of the right subclavian artery in 2 patients (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distal site of the ARSA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was closed followed by revascularization through a median sternotomy, and the ARSA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was left as a blind sack in 2 patients (group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: None of the patients in group 1 or 3 had any postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In group 2, 1 had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0349422" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">steal syndrome</z:e> caused by the exclusion of the ARSA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, and the other died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> 2 months after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Complete anatomical repair of the ARSA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> could be performed through the combination of the supraclavicular approach and the left posterolateral thoracotomy, with excellent results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Exclusion of the ARSA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> without revascularization resulted in a suboptimal outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Surgical results of simple closure of the ARSA followed by revascularization were uneventful, but the ARSA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was left as a blind sack </plain></SENT>
