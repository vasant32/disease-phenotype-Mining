<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the tolerability and efficacy of the investigational use of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor blocker <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> added to β-blockade (BB) to prevent progressive aortic root dilation in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between May 1, 2007, and September 31, 2011, 28 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> (11 males [39%]; mean ± SD age, 13.1±6.3 years) with recognized aortic root dilation (z score &gt;2.0) and receiving BB (atenolol or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi>) treatment were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were randomized to receive BB (BB: 13 patients) or β-blockade and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> (BB-L: 15 patients) for 35 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the BB-L group, aortic root dilation was reduced with treatment, and the annual dilation rate of the aortic root was significantly lower than that of the BB group (0.10 mm/yr vs 0.89 mm/yr; P=.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The absolute aortic diameters at the sinus of Valsalva, annulus, and sinotubular junction showed similar trends, with a reduced rate of dilation in the BB-L group (P=.02, P=.03, and P=.03, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients (33%) treated with BB-L were noted to have a reduced aortic root diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the differences between the groups regarding changes in aortic stiffness and cross-sectional compliance were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This randomized, open-label, active controlled trial mostly based on a pediatric population demonstrated for the first time that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> add-on BB therapy is safe and provides more effective protection to slow the progression of aortic root dilation than does BB treatment alone in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
