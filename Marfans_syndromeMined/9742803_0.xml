<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although there is controversy about the operative procedure whether the aortic arch should be replaced or not in aortic arch dissection in which the primary intimal tear is located at or extends into the arch, the resection of the aortic arch tear and simultaneous arch repair with graft replacement of the ascending aorta would be the acceptable procedure in the long term period with the recent improvement of adjunct technique for the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and heart protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The composite graft replacement of the aortic root is also indicated in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection associated with annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and severely destroyed aortic root with the extension of dissection to the aortic root with acceptable mortality and survival rate in the early and late period </plain></SENT>
