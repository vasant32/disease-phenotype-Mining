<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To describe the clinical, ocular, and genetic findings in multiple members of a family with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>lens dislocation</z:hpo>, clinical corneal guttae, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> family members underwent complete physical and ophthalmic examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After informed consent was given, DNA was obtained from eleven family members, eight of whom were affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three polymorphic markers near the fibrillin 1 (FBN1) locus were genotyped and the results analyzed using the VITESSE program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Amplification of the 65 exons and flanking intronic sequences of FBN1 was performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fragments with mobility variations were sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pedigree analysis revealed a three generation family with eight of eleven individuals affected by early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>lens dislocation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011003'>high myopia</z:hpo>, typical facies, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002007'>frontal bossing</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>flexion contractures</z:hpo>, proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint thickening, clinical corneal guttae, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Genetic linkage analysis using polymorphic markers near FBN1 demonstrated an LOD score of 1.78 (maximum possible LOD score 1.78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conformation sequence gel electrophoresis analysis suggested a sequence variation in exon 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sequencing revealed a C965G substitution, resulting in an S322C coding change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This sequence variant segregated with affection status and was not identified in 154 control chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This syndrome is consistent with a novel mutation in the FBN1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>FBN1 mutations have been previously described as causative for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>lens dislocation</z:hpo>, progressive corneal guttae, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> is unusual for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This study expands the Marfan phenotype and demonstrates a possible link between guttae, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo>, and fibrillin 1 disorders </plain></SENT>
