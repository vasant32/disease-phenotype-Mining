<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Lesions of the ascending aorta associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic valve disease</z:e> are usually treated by implanting a prosthetic valved conduit (Bentall procedure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, we present our experience in which a valved homograft conduit was used for the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six patients underwent a Bentall procedure with the use of a cryopreserved valved homograft conduit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of the patients had annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath>, 2 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and 1 had an atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> due to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo>, along with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and localized dissection of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients, the aortic annulus was substantially dilated, with accompanying moderate-to-severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A standard procedure was performed with moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, cardiopulmonary bypass, and aortic and bicaval cannulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ascending aorta and the aortic valve were replaced with a cryopreserved valved homograft conduit (aortic in 5 patients and pulmonary in 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The native coronary ostia were anastomosed directly to the homograft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography, which was performed intraoperatively, before discharge from the hospital, and at follow-up visits (1 to 36 months), revealed good valve function without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the homograft conduits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was 1 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to Aspergillus fumigatus <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, 6 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 1 patient, magnetic resonance imaging performed at 24 months revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> caliber of the homograft conduit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the Bentall procedure can be performed, safely and with excellent results, using cryopreserved homograft conduits </plain></SENT>
