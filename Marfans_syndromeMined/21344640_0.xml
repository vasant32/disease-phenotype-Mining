<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe an analysis of the responses of 605 adults with experience with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> (NF) to the BNE Scale, a scale specifically designed to assess the background, needs, and expectations (BNE) of genetic counseling patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Significant group differences were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specifically, the respondents in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> group reported more favorable beliefs about the condition and the availability of social support than the respondents in the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Respondents in the NF group reported more unsureness about their condition and a greater need for genetic information than members of the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Notably, having positive feelings about the condition was negatively correlated with support group interest for respondents of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> group (r = -0.159, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Having an affected child was associated with interest in health provider input (t = -3.4; P = 0.001) and the desire to talk about psychosocial issues (t = -2.9; P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, previous experience with genetic counseling was not found to affect BNE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results support the usefulness of the BNE Scale to compare the BNE of patient groups, as well as provide important insight into the BNE of individuals seeking counseling about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and NF </plain></SENT>
