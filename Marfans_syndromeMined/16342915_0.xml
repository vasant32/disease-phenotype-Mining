<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data of moleculor genetic analysis and a catalogue of clinical manifestations including aortic elastic parameters were mined in order to (i) assess aortic abnormality before and during medical treatment, and to (ii) identify novel correlations between the genotype and phenotype of the disease using hierarchical cluster analysis and logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A score measure describing the similarity between a patient's clinical symptoms and a characteristic phenotype class was introduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A probabilistic model for monitoring the loss of aortic elasticity was built on merely aortic parameters of 34 patients with classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and 43 control subjects showing a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 96% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical phenotypes of 100 individuals with classical or suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> were clustered yielding four different phenotypic expressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The highest correlation was found between FBN1 missense mutations, which manifested as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo>, skeletal major and skin minor criteria, and two out of four clustered phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The probability of the presence of a missense mutation in both phenotype classes is approximately 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring of aortic elastic properties during medical treatment may serve as additional criterion to indicate elective surgical interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Genotype-phenotype correlation may contribute to anticipate the clinical consequences of specific FBN1 mutations more comprehensively and may be helpful to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients at risk at on early stage of disease </plain></SENT>
