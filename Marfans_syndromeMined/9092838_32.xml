<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The etiology and pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> are clearly multifactorial, with genetic factors playing an increasingly recognized role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>Intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> have been associated with numerous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heritable connective tissue disorders</z:e>, which account for at least 5% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these disorders, the most important are <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268338" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="EDS4">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Type IV</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> Type 1, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000113'>polycystic kidney disease</z:hpo>; the association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>, however, has been firmly established only for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000113'>polycystic kidney disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> are not rare but account for 7 to 20% of patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and are generally not associated with any of the known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heritable connective tissue disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First-degree relatives of patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> are at an approximately fourfold increased risk of suffering ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>, compared to the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Various possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>modes of inheritance</z:hpo> have been identified in families with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>, suggesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the benefits have never been quantified, screening for asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> should be considered in families with two or more affected members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The yield of such a screening program may approximate 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although it is unlikely that there is a single gene with major effect, much effort is currently being directed at locating <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> genes </plain></SENT>
