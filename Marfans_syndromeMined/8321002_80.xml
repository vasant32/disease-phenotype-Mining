<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the 656 patients operated on between July 7, 1979, and January 30, 1991, 43% (n = 283) were female, the median age of the patients was 64 years (range 10 to 88 years), 12% (n = 77) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection, 26% (n = 173) had previously undergone either cardiac or ascending aortic operations, and 13% (n = 85) had a history of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty-four patients underwent elephant trunk procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> time was 31 minutes (range 7 to 120 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The univariable predictors of transient or permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, defined as clinical evidence of neurologic injury, either global or hemiparetic, which occurred in 44 patients (7%), were as follows (p &lt; 0.05): increased age; a history of cerebrovascular disease; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> time (7 to 29 minutes = 12/298 [4%], 30 to 44 minutes = 15/201 [7.5%], 45 to 59 minutes 9/84 [10.7%], 60 to 120 minutes 7/48 [14.6%]; cardiopulmonary bypass time; and concurrent descending thoracic aorta repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The multivariably determined predictors were as follows (p &lt; 0.05): a history of cerebrovascular disease; previous aortic surgery distal to the left subclavian artery; and cardiopulmonary bypass time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003504" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ai">aortic valve incompetence</z:e>, however, was associated with a lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (adjusted odds ratio 0.42, p = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The multivariably determined predictors for increased risk of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05), which occurred in 66 (10%) patients, were as follows: increased age; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>; concurrent distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo>; previous ascending aortic operation; cardiopulmonary bypass time; cardiac complications; renal complications; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this study, the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was observed to increase after 40 minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e>; furthermore, the mortality rate increased markedly after 65 minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus the "safe" period for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> not developing appeared to be limited to approximately 40 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> is a safe technique for the repair of complex aortic problems provided both the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> and the cardiopulmonary bypass times are not excessive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, the clinical characteristics of the patients are important determinants of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
