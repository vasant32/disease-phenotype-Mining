<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the association of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and pregnancy is extremely rare, the case reported here being only the fifth on record, the concurrence of dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> with pregnancy is more frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore it is accepted that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in young women below the age of 40 is more common in the pregnant than those not pregnant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cause of the enhancing effect of pregnancy is unknown but is thought to be <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> since the stability of connective tissue can be influenced by hormones, particularly the sex steroids </plain></SENT>
