<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proband of family 1 has the R2726W FBN1 mutation associated with isolated skeletal features on one allele and a pathogenic FBN1 mutation on the other allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The phenotype of the compound-heterozygous probands appears to be more severe than that of their heterozygous family members which underlines the possibility that certain trans-located FBN1 mutations might act as modifiers of phenotype explaining some of the intrafamilial variability in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
