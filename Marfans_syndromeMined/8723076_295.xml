<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over time, weaknesses have emerged in these criteria, a problem accentuated by the advent of molecular testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we propose a revision of diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and related conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most notable are: more stringent requirements for diagnosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in relatives of an unequivocally affected individual; skeletal involvement as a major criterion if at least 4 of 8 typical skeletal manifestations are present; potential contribution of molecular analysis to the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>; and delineation of initial criteria for diagnosis of other heritable conditions with partially overlapping phenotypes </plain></SENT>
