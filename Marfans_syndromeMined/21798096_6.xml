<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily consists of a variety of cytokines expressed in many different cell types including skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Members of this superfamily that are of particular importance in skeletal muscle are TGF-β1, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and myostatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These signaling molecules play important roles in skeletal muscle homeostasis and in a variety of inherited and acquired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852419,C0027868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of these molecules is linked to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> processes in skeletal muscle such as growth, differentiation, regeneration, and stress response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> elevation of TGF-β1, MAPKs, and myostatin is linked to various features of muscle pathology, including impaired regeneration and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this review, we focus on the aberrant signaling of TGF-β in various disorders such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo>, sarcopenia, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critical illness</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also discuss how the inhibition of several members of the TGF-β signaling pathway has been implicated in ameliorating disease phenotypes, opening up novel therapeutic avenues for a large group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852419,C0027868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
