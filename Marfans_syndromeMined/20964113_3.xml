<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is usually associated with fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene mutations, an extracellular matrix protein, and its diagnosi requires the presence of several clinical criteria, called the Ghent criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies with animal models have helped understand some of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of the syndrome, and the core role of transforming growth factor, (TGF-beta) signalling pathways in these mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings created new therapeutic opportunities, like the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi>, known to have an antagonistic effect on TGF-beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the aging of this population, new clinical manifestations are expected, requiring close and continued <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patient monitoring </plain></SENT>
