<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to develop a simpler echocardiographic screening tool for aortic root dilation in pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aortic root dilation represents the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is traditionally defined by nomograms, relating aortic root dimensions to height or body surface area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, the descending aorta (DAo) was used as an internal reference, thereby eliminating the need for nomograms when screening for aortic root dilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The diameters of the aortic root at the sinus of Valsalva and the DAo were measured in 35 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and 52 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls in the parasternal long-axis echocardiographic view </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The root/DAo ratio was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A root/DAo ratio &gt; or = 2 provided optimal sensitivity for root dilation (100%), whereas a root/DAo ratio &gt; or = 2.3 provided optimal specificity (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The root/DAo ratio provides a simple, rapid, and valuable screening test for aortic root dilation, independent of nomograms and body size </plain></SENT>
