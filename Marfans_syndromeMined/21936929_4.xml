<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of mutations involved in the etiology of these disorders are missense and nonsense mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, large deletions and duplications undetected by sequencing may be implicated in their pathogenesis, and may explain the apparent lack of genotype-phenotype correlation in a subset of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to search for large pathogenic deletions and/or duplications in the FBN1, TGFβR1, and TGFβR2 genes using multiplex-ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) in patients with aortopathy, in whom no mutations in the FBN1, TGFβR1, and TGFβR2 genes were identified by sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 14 patients from 11 unrelated families with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of those, six patients (including 3 first-degree relatives), fulfilled the revised Ghent criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and eight had predominantly <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo>/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> with variable skeletal and craniofacial involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MLPA for FBN1, TGFβR1, and TGFβR2 was carried out in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A 385 K chromosome 15 specific array was used in two patients with a deletion of the entire FBN1 in order to define its size and boundaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified two novel large deletions in the FBN1 gene in four patients of two unrelated families who met clinical diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient was found to have a FBN1 deletion encompassing exons 1-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The other three patients had a 542 Kb deletion spanning the whole FBN1 gene and five additional genes (SLC24A5, MYEF2, CTXN2, SLC12A1, DUT) in the chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings expand the number of large FBN1 deletions, and emphasize the importance of screening for large genomic deletions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> featuring aortopathies, especially for those with classic Marfan phenotype </plain></SENT>
