<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen eyes of 18 patients with clinically suspected zonular abnormalities were evaluated using UBM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Predisposing factors included pseudoexfoliation, congenital spherophakia, surgical procedure, trauma, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 18 eyes, 11 showed UBM evidence of missing zonules and 11 showed evidence of zonular stretch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four of the 18 eyes had both missing and stretched zonular fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the eyes examined showed increased lenticular sphericity in the area of zonular disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine eyes showed ciliary body flattening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1273758" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pupillary block</z:e> was seen in 5 patients, and angle crowding due to direct iridal rotation was noted in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound biomicroscopy can detect zonular loss and stretching directly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased lenticular sphericity and ciliary body flattening are signs of zonular defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Angle closure mechanisms include <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1273758" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pupillary block</z:e> and direct iridal rotation </plain></SENT>
