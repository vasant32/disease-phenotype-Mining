<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We report our experience with aortic valve-sparing procedures in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between August 2003 and July 2007, we performed aortic valve-sparing procedures in 20 patients with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> resulting from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 28 +/- 10 years (range, 10 to 57 years), and there were 9 females and 11 males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A reimplantation technique was used in 9 cases, a remodeling technique in 8 and a patch technique in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional procedures included total aorta replacement in 1 patient, and aortic arch replacement plus stented elephant trunk in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up time was 46 +/- 16 months (range, 17 to 64 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No in-hospital or late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reexploration for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was required in one case on postoperative day 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No valve-related complications occurred during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the end of follow-up, trivial or no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> was demonstrated in 14 patients, mild in 4 patients, moderate in 1 and severe in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients with moderate and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> required reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The early and mid-term results of the valve-sparing operations were favorable, and the durability of the preserved valve should encourage use of this technique in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
