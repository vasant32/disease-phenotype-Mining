<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the gene encoding TGF-beta receptor-2 (TGFBR2) as a candidate gene for spinal CSF leaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We searched the TGFBR2 gene for mutations in eight patients with spontaneous spinal CSF leaks who also had other features associated with TGFBR2 mutations, i.e., skeletal features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005116'>arterial tortuosity</z:hpo>, and(or) thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age of these 7 women and 1 man was 38 years (range 14-60 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We detected no TGFBR2 mutations and conclude that TGFBR2 mutations are not a major factor in spontaneous spinal CSF leaks </plain></SENT>
