<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the aorta is a common pathology characterized by segmental weakening of the artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although it is generally accepted that the vessel-wall weakening is caused by an impaired collagen metabolism, a clear association has been demonstrated only for rare syndromes such as the vascular type <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that vessel-wall failure in growing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of patients who have aortic abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (AAA) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is not related to a collagen defect at the molecular level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the contrary our findings indicate similar (Marfan) or even higher collagen concentrations (AAA) and increased collagen cross-linking in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using 3D confocal imaging we show that the two conditions are associated with profound defects in collagen microarchitecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reconstructions of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vessel wall show that adventitial collagen fibers are organized in a loose braiding of collagen ribbons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These ribbons encage the vessel, allowing the vessel to dilate easily but preventing overstretching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AAA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> show dramatically altered collagen architectures with loss of the collagen knitting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Evaluations of the functional characteristics by atomic force microscopy showed that the wall has lost its ability to stretch easily and revealed a second defect: although vascular collagen in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aortic wall behaves as a coherent network, in AAA and Marfan tissues it does not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As result, mechanical forces loaded on individual fibers are not distributed over the tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrate that the mechanical properties of tissue are strongly influenced by collagen microarchitecture and that perturbations in the collagen networks may lead to mechanical failure </plain></SENT>
