<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Morphologically preserved aortic valve cusps represent an ideal condition for preservation and reconstruction of the aortic valve with an simultaneous replacement of the ascending aorta with a Dacron graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report presents the results of 140 patients, who underwent such surgery since 1993 in our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indications for surgery, operative technique and different outcome parameters are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intra- and perioperative morbidity and mortality are low and quality of life excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reoperation due to progressive <z:mp ids='MP_0006047'>aortic valve insufficiency</z:mp> was necessary in 2.1% of patients during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When compared with the standard operation (composite replacement utilizing a mechanical valve), patients with aortic valve reconstruction demonstrate similar results with regard to hospital stay and functional improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> are significantly reduced in patients undergoing valve reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Due to these long-term results combined with excellent stress hemodynamics and improvement in LV function, aortic valve reconstruction currently represents our standard operative strategy in this patient group </plain></SENT>
