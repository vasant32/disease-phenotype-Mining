<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Alternative management strategies for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic valve disease</z:e> and aortic operation include valve preservation and aortic repair (VPR), composite valve graft (CVG), or separate valve and aortic repair (SVR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated these approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 250 ascending/arch operations, 151 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic valvular disease</z:e> and dissection (n = 56, 37%) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> operated between November 1990 and January 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-seven patients underwent CVG insertion, 50 SVR, 13 VPR, and 21 only aortic repair alone (RA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty (40%) patients also had aortic arch repairs and 53 (35%) coronary artery bypasses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The early 30-day survival and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates were 99% (150 of 151) and 0% (0 of 151), respectively: CVG 100% (67 of 67), 0%; VPR 100% (13 of 13), 0%; SVR 98% (49 of 50), 0%; RA 100% (21 of 21), 0% (p = not significant [NS]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On late follow-up of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (5 to 92 months; 96% complete 1998), 3 CVG, 2 VPR, 6 SVR, and 0 RA patients died with respective 5-year Kaplan-Meier survival rates of 88.4%, 70%, 69%, and 100% (p = 0.07, log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The respective linear rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were 0%, 5.5% (n = 1), 0%, and 0%; for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> were 0%, 0%, 0%, and 0%; and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> were 2.2% (n = 3), 0%, 0%, and 0% (p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 11 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and no patient required reoperation or ruptured the ascending aorta or the aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: With careful selection of the appropriate method excellent early and late results can be achieved </plain></SENT>
