<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> whose mutation was not detected by heteroduplex analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Primary cultured patient fibroblasts were metabolically labelled and found to secrete fibrillin-1 defectively when compared with an age-matched control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of patient cDNA, isolated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of patient fibroblast <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, detected a 33-bp insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reading frame of the mutant allele was maintained and predicted the insertion of 11 amino acids at the beginning of calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like domain 29 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing of genomic DNA detected a heterozygous G+1--&gt;A transversion in intron 46 of FBN1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 11 amino acid insertion was the consequence of the usage of a cryptic splice site 33-bp downstream of the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is the first reported case of a splicing defect in FBN1 leading to the production of a full-length fibrillin-1 transcript containing a large amino acid insertion </plain></SENT>
