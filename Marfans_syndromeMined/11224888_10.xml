<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To describe thoracolumbar spinal abnormalities and their correlation with age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo> among patients with Stickler syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Stickler syndrome (hereditary arthro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015397" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ophthalmopathy</z:e>) is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> characterized by skeletal, ocular, oral-facial, cardiac, and auditory manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prevalence is approximately 1 in 10,000 (similar to that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No one has investigated spinal abnormalities in a large series of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A single-center evaluation of 53 patients from 24 families with Stickler syndrome (age range, 1-70 years) in a multidisciplinary genetics clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thoracolumbar radiographs were analyzed for spinal abnormalities and correlation with age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-four percent of patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, 74% endplate abnormalities, 64% Schmorl's nodes, 43% <z:mp ids='MP_0011175'>platyspondylia</z:mp>, and 43% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036310" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Scheuermann</z:e>-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixty-seven percent of patients and 85% of adults reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Endplate abnormalities and Schmorl's nodes were associated with adult age; endplate abnormalities, Schmorl's nodes, and adult age were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only one adult patient was free of spinal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Spinal abnormalities are nearly uniformly observed in Stickler syndrome, progress with age, and are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although common, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> is generally self-limited (only one patient needed surgical treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Correct diagnosis of this syndrome facilitates early identification and management of other potentially severe systemic manifestations and genetic counseling for affected families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Moreover, recognition of Stickler syndrome allows accurate prognosis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>skeletal abnormalities</z:hpo> and anticipation of potential surgical complications </plain></SENT>
