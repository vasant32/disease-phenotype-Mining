<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We reviewed our experience with aortic valve-sparing operations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> during last 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between March 2004 and June 2009, 94 patients with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> underwent valve-sparing operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, 37 (68% male) were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, according to the Ghent diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 30 +/- 10 years (range, 11 to 59 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moderate/severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> was present in 13%, and the mean diameter of the Valsalva sinuses was 50 +/- 4 mm (range, 42 to 62 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The David V modification was performed in the last 28 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional procedures were mitral valve repair in 6, tricuspid valve repair in 3, closure of septal atrial defect in 2, and closure of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> in 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 27 +/- 16 months (range, 1 to 61 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and no major adverse outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient required implantation of a mechanical prosthesis during the same procedure because of moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No patients required reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the last follow-up, 23 patients did not have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, 12 had grade I, and 1 had grade II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No thromboembolic complications have been documented, and 97% of the patients are free from anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Short-term and midterm results with the reimplantation technique for aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in Marfan patients are excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>If long-term results are similar, this technique could be the treatment of choice for these patients </plain></SENT>
