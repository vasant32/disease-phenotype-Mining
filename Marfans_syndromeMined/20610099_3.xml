<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, University of Miami, Miami, Florida, USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative clinical features in eyes that had <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> combined with lensectomy as a primary procedure for complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> without severe posterior segment pathology (study group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), reoperations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> (RD), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011505'>cystoid macular edema</z:hpo> (CME) were ascertained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results were compared with those in a control group of eyes having combined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> and lensectomy for uncomplicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the study group (40 patients), 23 eyes had traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>lens dislocation</z:hpo>, 12 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, 7 had idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>lens dislocation</z:hpo>, and 4 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206368" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="XFS">pseudoexfoliation syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median corrected distance visual acuity improved from 20/185 (range 20/20 to hand motions) preoperatively to 20/30 (range 20/20 to hand motions) 3 months postoperatively (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The postoperative CDVA was poorer in cases with an etiology of trauma (P = .018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complications included RD (6.5%), transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0007902'>vitreous hemorrhage</z:hpo> (13.0%), choroidal detachment (4.3%) and CME (13.0%), which occurred more frequently in eyes with a history of trauma (P = .022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The control group (43 eyes; 42 patients) had 1 (2.3%) RD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pars plana vitrectomy with lensectomy yielded favorable visual outcomes in eyes with complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> in which standard anterior segment techniques were prohibitive or risky </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, preexisting conditions and postoperative complications may limit visual outcomes </plain></SENT>
