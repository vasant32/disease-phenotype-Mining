<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This cooperative study recensed 89 cases of patients operated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> in whom the dystrophic process was confirmed on anatomical (thin, translucent valves without symphysis, multilation or <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>) and histological criteria (mucinous infiltration) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They included 81 men (91%) and the average age was 52 +/- 14 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The valvular degeneration was part of a generalised <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> of elastic tissue in 8 patients (6 "formes frustes" of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, 2 Lobstein's syndrome) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the diameter of the ascending aorta measured by echocardiography and/or aortography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Group 1 (n = 40), the aorta was not dilated (diameter less than 40 mm) whereas in Group 2 (n = 49), the diameter of the ascending aorta was dilated (40-55 mm) but not aneurysmal (loss of parallelism of the aortic walls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two groups were comparable before surgery with respect to age, sex, functional class, degree of left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo>, left ventricular ejection fraction and presence of associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the operative parameters but aortic parietal biopsy (n = 35) revealed clear signs of cystic medianecrosis more often in Group 2 than in Group 1 (14/25 versus 1/10, p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No operative procedure was performed on the ascending aorta during aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After an average follow-up of 4 years, there was a higher mortality in Group 2: the actuarial 7 year survival rate being 74% in Group 1 and 54% in Group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This was explained by a higher incidence of ascending aortic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only 1 patient in Group 1 developed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta requiring reoperation compared to 14 patients in Group 2, 8 of whom were reoperated (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that non-aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0005111'>dilatation of the ascending aorta</z:hpo> in patients with dystrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> is a poor prognostic factor because of the high incidence of secondary aortic parietal complications (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, dissection) </plain></SENT>
