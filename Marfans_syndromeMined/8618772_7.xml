<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To describe the criteria and techniques for the surgery of hereditary subluxated lens in children and analyze the visual and surgical outcome after an extended period of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1982 to 1994, 65 children who had subluxation of their lens were followed in the authors' clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven children (59 eyes) underwent surgery (27 eyes had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>; 23 eyes had essential dislocation; and 9 eyes had a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000526'>aniridia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000568'>microphthalmia</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265313" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Weill-Marchesani syndrome</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The indications for surgery were best-corrected visual acuity of less than 20/70, forward sub-luxation of the lens to the anterior chamber, monocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo>, or rapidly progressing posterior subluxation of the lens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 54 eyes with subluxation of the crystalline lens behind the iris underwent pars plana lensectomy combined with anterior vitrectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In five eyes with total forward dislocation of the lens in the anterior chamber, a limbal approach for removal of the lens and protruding vitreous was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postoperative follow-up ranged from 12 to 144 months (average, 55 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After surgery, 522 eyes (88%) of the entire group achieved an improvement (2 lines or more on the Snellen chart) in best-corrected visual acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven eyes (12%) did not show improvement and remained with the same visual acuity as before the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>Retinal detachment</z:hpo> was detected in <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> 2 years after surgery and was the only major postoperative complications observed in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results and the unique continuous and long-term follow-up on our patients demonstrate that lensectomy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> combined with anterior vitrectomy using a closed-system technique is a beneficial and relatively safe procedure </plain></SENT>
