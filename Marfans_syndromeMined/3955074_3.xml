<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type III/I + III collagen ratios were twice as high in adult aortas as those found in skin samples of the same age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This ratio was lower in fetal and very young aortic samples and in 6-8 out of 12 pathological aortas (including one sample from a Marfan patient) when compared with adult controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the type III/I + III collagen ratio was high in fetal or very young skin and the values obtained from several patients did not differ from those of the control skin samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one pathological aorta out of six studied, the concentration of the reducible crosslink, dehydrohydroxylysinonorleucine, was higher than in controls, suggesting increased collagen synthesis or impaired maturation of collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These changes point to altered collagen metabolism in aortas of patients with annulo-aortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
