<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most serious immunological deviations were encountered in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> due to impaired phagocytic activity of neutrophils and monocytes, decreased number of T, T active, and B lymphocytes, and diminished function of T helpers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In unclassified complexes of developmental defects with Marfaneic ++ phenotypes, the immunological disorders were similar, but less deep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e>, a decrease of the number of immunocompetent cells, function of T helpers, and neutrophils was mainly revealed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In isolated forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>funnel chest</z:hpo> the function of monocytes and the number of immunoglobulins are mainly decreased </plain></SENT>
