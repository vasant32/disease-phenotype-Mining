<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using DHPLC and sequencing, we studied the mutation spectrum in 65 probands with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and related phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 24 mutations in FBN1 were identified, of which 19 (nine missense, six frameshift, two nonsense and two affecting splice junctions) were novel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 41 probands, six were identified to have novel TGFBR2 mutations (one frameshift and five missense mutations) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In probands who fulfilled the Ghent criteria (n = 16), mutations in FBN1 were found in 81% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of those with TGFBR2 mutations fulfilled the Ghent criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Novel missense mutations of unknown significance were classified according to the latest ACMG guidelines and their likelihood to be causative was evaluated </plain></SENT>
