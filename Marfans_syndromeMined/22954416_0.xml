<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Evaluation of vascular involvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan Syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) is focused to the ascending aorta, which has the major risk of dissection/rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From March 2006 to January 2011, 64 patients (35Â±13years old) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> underwent echocardiography and MRA of thoracic and abdominal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measurements of ascending aorta, aortic arch, descending thoracic and abdominal aorta, and aortic branch vessels were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> only non dissected vessels were considered for measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 64 Marfan patients were divided into 2 groups: patients in natural history (group A, 55%) and patients previously submitted to aortic root and/or ascending aorta replacement because of severe <z:mp ids='MP_0010574'>aortic dilation</z:mp> or dissection (group B, 45%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dilation of the descending aorta, mostly of the aortic isthmus, occurred in 18/53 patients (8/35 group A, 10/18 group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Abdominal aorta resulted in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in group A and in 16/18 patients of group B, while iliac vessels were dilated in 7/35 patients of group A and in 10/23 patients of group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients of group B presented isolated dilation of subclavian, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">celiac</z:e>, mesenteric, or renal arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Vascular dilation</z:e> beyond the aortic root is not uncommon in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The systematic use of MRA provides a comprehensive evaluation of the entire arterial system </plain></SENT>
