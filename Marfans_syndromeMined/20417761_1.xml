<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> remains controversial, with endovascular stent-graft techniques challenging traditional surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 1994 to April 2007, 104 patients (82 male, median age 60.5 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> underwent surgical repair, 0 to 21 years after initial diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A or B dissection (median 2.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three (22%) patients underwent urgent-emergent surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean aortic diameter was 6.9 +/- 1.4 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indications for surgery, other than aortic expansion, were pain in 6 (6%) patients, malperfusion in 6 (6%), and rupture in 11 (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine (47%) had previous cardioaortic surgery (29% dissection-related), 21 (20%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, 12 (12%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, and 4 (4%) were on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six (25%) had a thrombosed false lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty (29%) patients required reimplantation of visceral arteries; 8.3 +/- 2.7 segmental artery pairs were sacrificed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hospital mortality was 9.6% (10 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>Paraplegia</z:hpo> occurred in 5 (4.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients (26%) experienced adverse outcome (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within one year, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or dialysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Adverse outcome was associated with atheroma (p = 0.04, odds ratio = 4.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Survival was 78% at 1, 68% at 5, and 59% at 10 years (average follow-up, 7.7 +/- 4.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Freedom from distal aortic reoperation was 99% at 1, 93% at 5, and 83% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>After one year, patients enjoyed longevity equivalent to a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> age-sex matched population (standardized mortality ratio = 1.38, p = 0.23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>By multivariate analysis, atheroma (p = 0.0005, relative risk = 9.32) and age (p = 0.0003, relative risk = 1.15/year) were risk factors for long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of open repair for distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection is highlighted by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> survival after the first year, and a low reoperation-reintervention rate </plain></SENT>
