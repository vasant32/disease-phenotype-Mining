<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The syndrome is characterized phenotypically by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000316'>hypertelorism</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000193'>bifid uvula</z:hpo>, and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005116'>arterial tortuosity</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and dissections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LDS has a much more rapid clinical course than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) and thus those diagnosed with LDS are currently being recommended for prophylactic aortic root replacement at younger ages and with smaller aortic dimensions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aortic root tissue obtained at surgery was compared between 15 patients carrying a diagnosis of LDS, 11 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and 11 control aortas to evaluate the range of histopathologic changes in LDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Standard <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin and Movat pentachrome stains were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LDS samples had increased medial collagen and a subtle but diffuse form of elastic fiber fragmentation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_178'>extracellular matrix deposition</z:mpath>, referred to as diffuse medial degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LDS samples had significantly more diffuse medial degeneration compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and control samples (P&lt;0.05), significantly less medial degeneration of the "cystic" variety compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> (P&lt;0.01) and significantly more collagen deposition than control samples (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, an immunohistochemical stain for pSmad2, a marker of TGFbeta activity, was significantly increased in LDS patients compared with controls (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, the histologic findings of LDS are best appreciated with special stains to evaluate <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and elastic fiber fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The changes described, although not entirely specific for LDS, help differentiate this entity from other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> in the appropriate clinicopathologic setting </plain></SENT>
