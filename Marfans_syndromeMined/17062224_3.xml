<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate the rationale of tear-oriented conservative ascending/hemiarch replacement, comparing it against total arch replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 134 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection who underwent emergency surgery between 1995 and 2005 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age was 68 years (range, 19 to 90); the patients were 62 men and 72 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The extent of aortic resection included the ascending aorta and hemiarch in 105 patients (group AH) and the total aortic arch in 29 patients (group TA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hospital mortality rates in groups AH and TA were 6.7% and 6.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival rates were 77.4% (AH) and 80.8% (TA) after 5 years, and 63.5% (AH) and 80.8% (TA) after 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The freedom rates from reoperation were 91.3% (AH) and 88.0% (TA) after 5 years, and 60.9% (AH) and 76.6% (TA) after 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis indicated that predictors of reoperation were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic valve regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Limited ascending/hemiarch replacement did not increase the risk of reoperation and would not compromise late results </plain></SENT>
