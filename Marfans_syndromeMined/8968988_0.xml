<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The features of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> are 1) presence of the intimal tear at the proximal end in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, 2) its frequent location in the ascending aorta and aortic segment just distal to the left subclavian artery, and 3) the dissected plane at the outer media or medial-adventitial border </plain></SENT>
