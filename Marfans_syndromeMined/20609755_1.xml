<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A conventional single-stage procedure, staged procedures, or debranching of the supraaortic vessels, followed by immediate transfemoral stenting of the aortic arch, have been introduced to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type B dissection with aortic arch involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The best method for surgical repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type B dissection with aortic arch involvement alone or concomitant with proximal aortic lesions is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between October 2003 and December 2008, 19 patients underwent total arch replacement combined with stented elephant trunk implantation under hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass and selective cerebral perfusion through a median sternotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients had proximal aortic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postoperative computed tomography was used to evaluate <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and absorption of the false lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Concomitant proximal aortic lesions were repaired in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-day mortality was 5.26% (1/19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was one late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at a mean follow-up of 36 +/- 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no spinal cord injury or visceral malperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection underwent thoracoabdominal aortic replacement 6 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Obliteration of the false lumen around the stented elephant trunk was observed in 16 patients (94.1%, 16/17) during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This technique is safe, effective, and economical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Replacement of aortic arch dissection and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the dissected descending aorta was achieved simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Concomitant proximal aortic lesions were repaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Favorable surgical outcomes and postoperative results using this technique were obtained in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type B dissection with aortic arch involvement alone or concomitant with proximal aortic lesions </plain></SENT>
