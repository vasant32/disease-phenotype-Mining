<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Groenink et al demonstrated decreased aortic elasticity determined by measurement of local distensibility and flow wave velocity (FWV) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who did not undergo operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aortic elasticity after aortic root replacement (ARR) has not yet been investigated, but Imawaki et al demonstrated decreased aortic distensibility in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> after surgery of the abdominal and thoracic aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study investigates the feasibility of MRI for assessing aortic elasticity in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> after elective ARR, and compares aortic elasticity in these patients with the aortic elasticity of patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who did not undergo surgery using MRI </plain></SENT>
