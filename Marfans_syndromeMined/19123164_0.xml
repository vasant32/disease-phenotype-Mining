<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The capsule fixation device (CFD) is <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53205">poly(methyl methacrylate)</z:chebi> arch with double-armed bent hook that can be introduced into the anterior chamber through the clear corneal incision, placed with a rest on the capsule equator, and sutured to the sclera without injury of the capsular bag </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 16-year-old patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> underwent consecutive phacoemulsification with in-the-bag intraocular lens and CFD implantation on both eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the surgery handling the CFD was technically simple with good visualization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The preoperative best-corrected visual acuity was 0.3 and 0.1 and postoperatively 0.6 and 0.8 in the right and left eyes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The postoperative follow-up was over 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Use of the CFD was successful in a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001132'>lens subluxation</z:hpo> with no complications observed during the period of follow-up </plain></SENT>
