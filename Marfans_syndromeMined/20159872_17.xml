<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CONTEXT: The New Kingdom in ancient Egypt, comprising the 18th, 19th, and 20th dynasties, spanned the mid-16th to the early 11th centuries bc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The late 18th dynasty, which included the reigns of pharaohs Akhenaten and Tutankhamun, was an extraordinary time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The identification of a number of royal mummies from this era, the exact relationships between some members of the royal family, and possible illnesses and causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> have been matters of debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To introduce a new approach to molecular and medical Egyptology, to determine familial relationships among 11 royal mummies of the New Kingdom, and to search for pathological features attributable to possible murder, consanguinity, inherited disorders, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: From September 2007 to October 2009, royal mummies underwent detailed anthropological, radiological, and genetic studies as part of the King Tutankhamun Family Project </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mummies distinct from Tutankhamun's immediate lineage served as the genetic and morphological reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To authenticate DNA results, analytical steps were repeated and independently replicated in a second ancient DNA laboratory staffed by a separate group of personnel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven royal mummies dating from circa 1410-1324 bc and suspected of being kindred of Tutankhamun and 5 royal mummies dating to an earlier period, circa 1550-1479 bc, were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Microsatellite-based haplotypes in the mummies, generational segregation of alleles within possible pedigree variants, and correlation of identified diseases with individual age, archeological evidence, and the written historical record </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Genetic fingerprinting allowed the construction of a 5-generation pedigree of Tutankhamun's immediate lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The KV55 mummy and KV35YL were identified as the parents of Tutankhamun </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000771'>gynecomastia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="CRS|CSO|CRS1">craniosynostoses</z:e> (eg, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265307" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Antley-Bixler syndrome</z:e>) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> were found, but an accumulation of malformations in Tutankhamun's family was evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Several pathologies including KÃ¶hler disease II were diagnosed in Tutankhamun; none alone would have caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Genetic testing for STEVOR, AMA1, or MSP1 genes specific for Plasmodium falciparum revealed indications of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> tropica in 4 mummies, including Tutankhamun's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results suggest avascular bone <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in conjunction with the malarial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> as the most likely cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in Tutankhamun </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Walking impairment and malarial disease sustained by Tutankhamun is supported by the discovery of canes and an afterlife pharmacy in his tomb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Using a multidisciplinary scientific approach, we showed the feasibility of gathering data on Pharaonic kinship and diseases and speculated about individual causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
