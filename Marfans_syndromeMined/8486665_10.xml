<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fibroblasts from young patients exhibiting clinical features of progeroidal syndromes showed decreased biosynthesis of the small <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> decorin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cells in culture were metabolically labeled, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> secreted into the medium were analyzed electrophoretically after immunoprecipitation with antibodies raised against decorin and biglycan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fluorograms showed regularly a reduction to 15-30% of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> amount of mature decorin and its core protein after chondroitin ABC lyase treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The size of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycan</z:chebi> chains was increased, but there was no obvious anomaly in the secretion kinetics of the mature <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the patients' fibroblasts synthesized an increased amount of biglycan compared to control cells from healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis clearly demonstrated a reduction by 85-94% in decorin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, but biglycan <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was concomitantly increased, indicating that these alterations occur at the transcriptional level of protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transcription of decorin in fibroblasts from one of the patients was stimulated up to 3-fold by treatment with interleukin-1 beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No response to interleukin-1 beta and transforming growth factor-beta was observed in the cells from another patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization of cultured cells with an antisense decorin probe showed that decorin levels were reduced throughout the cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, subsequent examination of cells from one of the patients, now in mid-teenage, revealed a return to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of decorin expression compared to age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that, as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> where the primary defect concerns the fibrillin gene, reduced decorin expression contributes to the formation of an abnormal matrix and the pathogenesis of these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>They also indicate that this abnormality is likely to represent a secondary phenomenon which leads to a fault in the regulation of decorin gene transcription </plain></SENT>
