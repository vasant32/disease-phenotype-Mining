<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a retrospective review of medical records from one genetics clinic and found that the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002108'>spontaneous pneumothorax</z:hpo> in patients older than 12 years with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> was 4.4% (11 out of 249) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Men were more commonly, but no more severely, affected than women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had recurrent or bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 9 of the 11 patients, apical bullae were present and detectable on chest radiograph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>Pneumothorax</z:hpo> frequently recurred if not treated by resection of the offending bullae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We recommend that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> adolescent and adult patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> undergo chest radiography for ascertainment of the gross pathological condition of the lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Definitive surgical treatment should be performed at the first occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo> because of the high rate of recurrence after treatment with a chest tube, with or without pleurodesis </plain></SENT>
