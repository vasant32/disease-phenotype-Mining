<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FBN1 contains 47 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like modules, 43 of which display a consensus sequence for calcium binding (cbEGF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Calcium binding by cbEGF modules is thought to be essential for the conformation and stability of fibrillin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Missense mutations in cbEGF modules are the most common mutations found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and generally affect one of the six highly conserved cysteines or residues of the calcium-binding consensus sequence </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A mutation affecting a residue of the calcium-binding consensus sequence (K1300E) found in a patient with relatively mild clinical manifestations of classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> caused a modest increase in susceptibility to in vitro proteolysis by trypsin, whereas a mutation affecting the sixth <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32460">cysteine residue</z:chebi> of the same cbEGF module (C1320S) reported in a severely affected patient caused a dramatic increase in susceptibility to in vitro proteolysis by trypsin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A mutation at the cryptic cleavage site for trypsin abolished sensitivity of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> fragments and fragments containing K1300E to trypsin proteolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whereas the relevance of in vitro proteolysis to the in vivo pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> remains unclear, our findings demonstrate that individual mutations in cbEGF modules can affect these modules differentially and may suggest an explanation for some genotype-phenotype relationships in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
