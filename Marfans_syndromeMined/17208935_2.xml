<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The main aim of this study was to describe the age at which pathological aortic root dilation occurs in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 160 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> attending a regional cardiac centre were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005111'>Dilation of the ascending aorta</z:hpo> was diagnosed by comparing the maximum aortic sinus measurement with control data from the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We employed a Kaplan-Meier survival curve to estimate the age at which <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the total group at presentation was 15.5 years (range 1.5-40 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>Skeletal abnormalities</z:hpo> were present in 95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eye involvement was found in 18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 115/160 patients with an abnormal aortic root, 78/115 (68%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> before 19 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From the Kaplan-Meier curve, it can be estimated that about 35% of the patients have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> already at the age of 5 years and 70% before the age of 20 years, and at least 80% by 40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 31 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aortic root when first seen but 24/31 (77%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> before the age of 19 years and 7/31 (22.6%) after 19 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of those (seven patients) who developed new pathological <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> after age 19 years, the age range was between 21 and 40 years with a mean of 27 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, 13 patients (8%) had surgery for aortic root replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>Aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> develops early in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and was present in 35% by the age of 5 years and 68% by 19 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Even though new aortic root dilation is relatively rare, it is not possible to safely discharge patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> as about one-third of the patients in our series who developed new pathological aortic root dilation did so after the age of 19 years </plain></SENT>
