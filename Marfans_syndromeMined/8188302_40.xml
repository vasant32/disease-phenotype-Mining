<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the first EL mutation in the FBN1 gene confirming that EL is caused by mutations of this gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>So far, several mutations in the FBN1 gene have been reported in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> are clinically related but distinct conditions with typical manifestations in the ocular and skeletal systems, the fundamental difference between them being the absence of cardiovascular involvement in EL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report a point mutation, cosegregating with the disease in the described family, that displays EL over four generations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mutation changes a conserved <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32483">glutamic acid residue</z:chebi> in an EGF-like motif, which is the major structural component of the fibrillin and is repeated throughout the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro mutagenetic studies have demonstrated the necessity of an analogous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32483">glutamic acid residue</z:chebi> for calcium binding in an EGF-like repeat of human factor IX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This provides a possible explanation for the role of this mutation in the disease pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
