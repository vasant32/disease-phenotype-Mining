<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heritable connective tissue disorder</z:e> caused by mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This syndrome constitutes a significant identifiable subtype of aortic aneurysmal disease, accounting for over 5% of ascending and thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We used spotted membrane DNA macroarrays to identify genes whose altered expression levels may contribute to the phenotype of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our analysis of 4132 genes identified a subset with significant expression differences between skin fibroblast cultures from unaffected controls versus cultures from affected individuals with known fibrillin-1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, 10 genes were chosen for validation by quantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Differential expression of many of the validated genes was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> samples when an additional group of unaffected and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> affected subjects were analyzed (p-value &lt; 3 x 10-6 under the null hypothesis that expression levels in cultured fibroblasts are unaffected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> status) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An unexpected observation was the range of individual gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In unaffected control subjects, expression ranges exceeding 10 fold were seen in many of the genes selected for qRT-PCR validation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The variation in expression in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> affected subjects was even greater </plain></SENT>
