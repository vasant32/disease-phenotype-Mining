<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To heighten the awareness of pediatricians and pediatric cardiologists to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, a potentially dangerous medical condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the charts of 13 patients, seen in four medical centers, who suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> over the period 1970 through 2000 whilst under the age of 25 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were seven male and six female patients, with the mean age at diagnosis being 12.1 years, with a range from one day to 25 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Congenital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_92'>cardiac defects</z:mpath> were present in five patients, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In three of the patients with congenital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_92'>cardiac defects</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> developed as a complication of medical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In three patients, dissection followed blunt trauma to the chest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We could not identify any risk factors in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presenting symptoms included <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> in four patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> and signs of ischemic bowel in two, non-palpable femoral pulses in one, and obstruction of the superior caval vein in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Angiography and magnetic resonance imaging were the main diagnostic tools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall mortality was 38% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only six patients had successful surgical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Due to the rarity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> a high index of suspicion is required to reach the diagnosis in a timely manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It should be considered in young patients complaining of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> in association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, anomalies of the aortic valve and arch, and chest trauma </plain></SENT>
