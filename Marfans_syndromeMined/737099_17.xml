<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 275 first degree relatives of whom 220 were living, and 188 (85.5%) of these were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven first degree relatives were found to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic valve disease</z:e>, and in a further 11 there was 'doubtful' evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valves</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 6 families there was more than 1 affected member and in an additional 7 families there was 1 or more 'doubtful' first degree relative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The minimum family incidence was therefore 14.6 per cent, or 31.7 per cent if 'doubtful' cases were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> is most probably multifactorial, but occasionally the condition may occur as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difficulties of diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valves</z:hpo> before the development of obstruction of left ventricular outflow were encountered and are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001670'>asymmetric septal hypertrophy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> was also noted </plain></SENT>
