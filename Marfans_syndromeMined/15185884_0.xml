<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Replacement of the aortic valve and ascending aorta with a composite graft is the most common surgical treatment for aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> (AR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the early 90's reconstructive procedures of the aortic root have been described with encouraging results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper presents our experience with this technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 2001 and May 2003, 28 patients (25 males, 3 females, mean age 60 years) with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> were treated with reimplantation of the aortic valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients had AR &gt; 2+, 5 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, 5 had an aortic arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, 4 had type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, 2 patients had associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, and one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral valve insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The only contraindication was primitive disease of the aortic leaflets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was one perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>) and 1 patient was discharged with mild to moderate AR requiring aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamping times were 230 and 184 min respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No neurological events were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During follow-up (mean 16.7 months, range 3-32 months) 1 patient died and one had mild AR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Freedom from reoperation and from AR at 24 months was 94 and 89% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At multivariate analyses we did not find any correlation between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, grade of preoperative AR, and recurrence of AR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, valve-sparing surgery was feasible with a low mortality and morbidity and with good early results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It should be applied to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients requiring aortic root surgery for aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, a diseased aortic valve being the only contraindication </plain></SENT>
