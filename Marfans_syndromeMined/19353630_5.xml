<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the FBN1 gene cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) and have been associated with a wide range of milder overlapping phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A proportion of patients carrying a FBN1 mutation does not meet diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, and are diagnosed with "other type I fibrillinopathy." In order to better describe this entity, we analyzed a subgroup of 146 out of 689 adult propositi with incomplete "clinical" international criteria (Ghent nosology) from a large collaborative international study including 1,009 propositi with a pathogenic FBN1 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We focused on patients with only one major clinical criterion, [including isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> (EL; 12 patients), isolated ascending <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> (17 patients), and isolated major skeletal manifestations (1 patient)] or with no major criterion but only minor criteria in 1 or more organ systems (16 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At least one component of the Ghent nosology, insufficient alone to make a minor criterion, was found in the majority of patients with isolated ascending <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> and isolated EL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with isolated EL, missense mutations involving a cysteine were predominant, mutations in exons 24-32 were underrepresented, and no mutations leading to a premature truncation were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Studies of recurrent mutations and affected family members of propositi with only one major clinical criterion argue for a clinical continuum between such phenotypes and classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using strict definitions, we conclude that patients with FBN1 mutation and only one major clinical criterion or with only minor clinical criteria of one or more organ system do exist but represent only 5% of the adult cohort </plain></SENT>
