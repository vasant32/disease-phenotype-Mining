<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we reviewed our experience of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who required multiple surgical interventions to identify the optimal treatment for these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between January 1986 and December 2000, 44 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> were operated on at Shizuoka City Hospital (SCH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among them, 10 patients (22.7%) underwent multiple surgical interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 5 male and 5 female patients with a mean age of 40.6 +/- 16.1 years at the initial surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only one patient was operated on at another hospital for his first, second, and third operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>His fourth operation was carried out at SCH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining 9 patients underwent a total of 14 additional surgical procedures at SCH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography (CT) scans were taken every 6 months postoperatively, and aortic diameter greater than 60 mm was considered as the indication for the additional surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and one late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The causes of additional surgery were enlargement of true <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in 6, enlargement of residual dissection in 4, new dissection in 4, false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> at the coronary anastomosis of Bentall procedure in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 9 patients, both ascending and descending aorta were replaced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among these 9 patients, only 3 patients underwent total arch replacement, and remaining 6 patients had their arch left in place with or without dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our current strategy of the treatment of Marfan patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection is total arch replacement with an elephant trunk at the initial emergent surgery </plain></SENT>
