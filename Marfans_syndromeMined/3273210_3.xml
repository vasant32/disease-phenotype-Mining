<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study is based on 40 consecutive patients operated on for annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> at the Turku University Central Hospital between March 1970 and April 1983 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Supracoronary graft insertion was used in the first nine patients, while the remaining patients were treated by radical repair using a composite graft and reimplantation of the coronary ostia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the patients was 40.3 years (10 to 66 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were examined postoperatively for their physical, radiological, and ophthalmological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight had the classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients had 230 first-degree relatives, and 200 of them were alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three of the 30 deceased relatives had died due to rupture of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo>; 187 of the living relatives were examined as above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, echocardiography was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six of the surviving relatives had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the aortic root; 24 were siblings, and two were children of the operated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography of the relatives revealed an increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> and enlargement of the left ventricle and left atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the relatives examined had the classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, although the incidence of some Marfan features occurred more frequently in the Marfan families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It seems clear that annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath>, even without the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>, is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hereditary disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>To detect annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> at an early stage, examination of the first-degree relatives of patients operated upon is recommended </plain></SENT>
