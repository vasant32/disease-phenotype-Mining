<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have illustrated the variability in disease severity and clinical manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Useful genotype-phenotype correlations have been slow to emerge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We screened 57 unrelated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> or a Marfan-like phenotype using a combination of SSCP and/or DHPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We detected 49 different FBN1 mutations, 30 (62%) of which were novel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mutations comprised 38 substitutions (78%), 10 deletions (20%), and one duplication (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 28 missense (57%), nine frameshift (18%), eight splice site (16%), and four nonsense mutations (8 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Genotype-phenotype analysis revealed that patients with an identified FBN1 mutation were more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> and cardiovascular complications compared to those without an identifiable mutation (relative risks of 4.6 and 1.9, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>Ectopia lentis</z:hpo> was also found to be more prevalent in patients whose mutations involved a cysteine substitution (relative risk 1.6) and less prevalent in those with premature termination mutations (relative risk 0.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In our hands, we achieved 93% mutation detection for DHPLC analysis of patients who fulfilled the Ghent criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further analysis of detailed clinical information and mutation data may help to anticipate the clinical consequences of specific FBN1 mutations </plain></SENT>
