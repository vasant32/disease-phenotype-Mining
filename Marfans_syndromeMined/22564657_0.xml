<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 23-year-old woman with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> underwent Bentall's operation and replacement of the ascending aorta (AsA) due to a type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (AD) in August 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In March 2005, she began to experience <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> on exertion and was found to have a huge pseudoaneurysm at the aortic root, which had caused dehiscence of the aortic conduit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In July 2009, she suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> and cold <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The computed tomography (CT) scan showed a recurrent dissection with a long intimal tear extending from the arch to the mid-portion of the descending thoracic aorta (DTA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Due to technical difficulties in the repair of the aortic root, she was placed on the HTx waiting list </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The next day, she received a donor heart and underwent combined HTx and total replacement of the thoracic aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Explantation of the heart improved the exposure of the DTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With the use of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0010775'>vascular ring</z:hpo> connector (Vasoring), the operation was successfully performed without need for a blood transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patient was still well at 2 years after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous replacement of the heart and the whole segment of the thoracic aorta is technically possible in Marfan patients who are complicated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
