<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To review the technical improvements and changes in management that have occurred over 21 years, which have made the minimally invasive repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> safer and more successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: In 1997, we reported our 10-year experience with a new minimally invasive technique for surgical correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> in 42 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since then, we have treated an additional 1173 patients, and in this report, we summarize the technical modifications which have made the repair safer and more successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 1987 to December 2008, we evaluated 2378 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We established criteria for surgical intervention, and patients with a clinically and objectively severe deformity were offered surgical correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The objective criteria used for surgical correction included computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, resting pulmonary function studies (spirometry and/or plethysmography), and a cardiology evaluation which included echocardiogram and electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgery was indicated if the patients were symptomatic, had a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> on a clinical basis and fulfilled two or more of the following: CT index greater than 3.25, evidence of cardiac or pulmonary compression on CT or echocardiogram, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002091'>restrictive lung disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data regarding evaluation, treatment, and follow up have been prospectively recorded since 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surgical repair was performed in 1215 (51%) of 2378 patients evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these, 1123 were primary repairs, and 92 were redo operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bars have been removed from 854 patients; 790 after primary repair operations, and 64 after redo operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean Haller CT index was 5.15 ± 2.32 (mean ± SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary function studies performed in 739 patients showed that FVC, FEV1, and FEF25-75 values were decreased by a mean of 15% below predicted value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>Mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> was present in 18% (216) of 1215 patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in 16% (194) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Of patients who underwent surgery, 2.8% (35 patients) had genetically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and an additional 17.8% (232 patients) had physical features suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>Scoliosis</z:hpo> was noted in 28% (340) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>At primary operation, 1 bar was placed in 69% (775 patients), 2 bars in 30% (338), and 3 bars in 0.4% (4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Complications decreased markedly over 21 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In primary operation patients, the bar displacement rate requiring surgical repositioning decreased from 12% in the first decade to 1% in the second decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0869403,C0700625,C0020517" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Allergy</z:e> to <z:chebi fb="152" ids="28112">nickel</z:chebi> was identified in 2.8% (35 patients) of whom 22 identified preoperatively received a <z:chebi fb="55" ids="33341">titanium</z:chebi> bar, 10 patients were treated successfully with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> and 3 required bar removal: 2 were switched to a <z:chebi fb="55" ids="33341">titanium</z:chebi> bar, and 1 required no further treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> occurred in 1.4% (17 patients), of whom 4 required surgical drainage (0.4% of the total) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0012151'>Hemothorax</z:hpo> occurred in 0.6% (8 patients); 4 during the postoperative period and four occurred late </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Postoperative pulmonary function testing has shown significant improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>A good or excellent anatomic surgical outcome was achieved in 95.8% of patients at the time of bar removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>A fair result occurred in 1.4%, poor in 0.8%, and recurrence of sufficient severity to require reoperation occurred in 11 primary surgical patients (1.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Five patients (0.6%) had their bars removed elsewhere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In the 752 patients, more than 1 year post bar removal, the mean time from initial operation to last follow up was 1341 ± 28 days (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>), and time from bar removal to last follow-up is 854 ± 51 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Age at operation has shifted from a median age of 6 years (range 1-15) in the original report to 14 years (range 1-31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The minimally invasive procedure has been successfully performed in 253 adult patients aged 18 to 31 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The minimally invasive repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> has been performed safely and effectively in 1215 patients with a 95.8% good to excellent anatomic result in the primary repairs at our institution </plain></SENT>
