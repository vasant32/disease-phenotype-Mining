<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate operative and long-term results of valve-sparing aortic root surgery in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The repair consisted of selective replacement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dissected and pathological sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-six patients (mean age 62 ± 14; range 29-88 years, 3 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>), operated on between August 2001 and July 2011 due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, underwent valve-sparing root repair, resulting in a valve preservation rate of 56% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> surgery involving the aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insufficiency grades of 0/1+, 2+, 3+ and 4+ were presented in 16, 17, 12 and 1 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Root repair with resection of the whole of the pathological aortic wall without the use of any glue was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Replacement of 1, 2 or 3 sinuses of Valsalva was performed in 29, 12 and 5 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concomitant cusp repair was necessary in 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> perioperative data were collected prospectively and an intention-to-treat analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 6 patients (median age 76, range 63-81 years) died, on average 10 months (range 0.9-44) after surgery resulting in an overall survival of 87% at the mean follow-up of 54 ± 37, range 0.9-132 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The linearized <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 2.9%/year, and the actuarial survival rate at 8 years was 85.5 ± 5.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was related to the aortic valve or aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no valve-related events and no patient required reoperation on the proximal aorta/aortic valve during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At the last echocardiography (47.8 ± 35.6 months after surgery), 33 patients showed no and 13 patients slight (1+) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Curative repair with replacement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pathological sinuses of Valsalva leads to an excellent long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Selected sinus repair is a simple and effective method of curative, valve-sparing root repair in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> because replacement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sinuses is seldom necessary </plain></SENT>
