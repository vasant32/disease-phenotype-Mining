<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed at exploring, over a 16-year period, the results of aortic root replacements employing this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1986 and 2002 forty-five patients (mean age 58.7 +/- 13.8 years old, 84.4% male) underwent a Cabrol procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic dissection</z:hpo> was the most frequent cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> in this series (n = 17), followed by annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> (n = 10), atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (n = 5) and poststenotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six patients (13.4%) had undergone a previous aortic operation, 8 (17.7%) had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and five (11.1%) underwent concomitant arch replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean clinical follow-up was 87.3 +/- 24.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients (93.3% of survivors) had a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) performed at a mean of 64 +/- 32 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Early mortality was 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was 9.1% for patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> and 41.2% for dissections (p = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Independent multivariate predictors of early mortality were: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (p = 0.009), emergency operation (p &lt; 0.001), operative year (p = 0.02), cross-clamp time (p = 0.001), and CPB duration (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival was 0.77 +/- 0.06, 0.72 +/- 0.06, 0.59 +/- 0.04 and 0.59 +/- 0.04 at 1, 5, 10, and 16 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed age (p = 0.007), cross-clamp time (p = 0.0006) and CPB duration (p = 0.009) as strong predictors of poor late survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A periprosthetic jet with significant valve regurgitation was detected by TEE in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In one of them, an infected periprosthetic space-right ventricular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> was demonstrated requiring reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Altogether, freedom from reoperation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> at 16 years was 0.97 +/- 0.02 and 0.94 +/- 0.03, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Cabrol technique demonstrated a nonnegligible incidence of early and long-term complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It should be rarely used and only when a "button" technique is not feasible </plain></SENT>
