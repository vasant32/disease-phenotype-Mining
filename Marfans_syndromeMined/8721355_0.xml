<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This new technique is done by excising the aneurysmal portion of the ascending aorta and sinuses of Valsalva but by leaving the aortic valve leaflets and some aortic wall attached to the left ventricular outflow tract inside the Dacron tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Postoperative echocardiography revealed well coapted aortic valve leaflets and a very small amount of regurgitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A rigid aortic route without sinuses of Valsalva may increase the mechanical stress on the leaflets and shorten their durability but this procedure have the advantage of so called Bentall's operation by preserving the native aortic valve </plain></SENT>
