<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> (IPE) have a high prevalence of MVP, but it is not known whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> is a risk in those patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that IPE and MS represent a spectrum of connective tissue <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> with MV and aortic root involvement, two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography was used to measure the aortic root diameter and assess for MVP in IPE (n = 31), MS (n = 14), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (n = 16) gender- and age-matched patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aortic root was measured in parasternal long- and short-axis views, just above the aortic sinuses, at end systole, in six cardiac cycles, and averaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Parasternal long-axis view was used to assess for MVP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aortic root diameter in IPE patients was not different from that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, 24 +/- 4 mm vs 22 +/- 4 mm (p = NS), respectively, both were significantly smaller than that in MS patients (30 +/- 5 mm; p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MVP was present in 17 of 31 (55%) IPE patients vs 12 of 14 (86%) MS patients (p = NS) and in only 1 of 16 (6%) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (p less than 0.05) vs both IPE and MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that young patients with IPE represent an isolated form of connective tissue abnormality because of the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> and MVP, but this is different from the systemic involvement of MS because of the lack of other systemic findings, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> and changes in body habitus </plain></SENT>
