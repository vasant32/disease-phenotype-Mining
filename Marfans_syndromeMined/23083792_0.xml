<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1993 to 2009, 233 patients (27% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo>, 40% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e>) underwent Tirone David valve-sparing aortic root replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up averaged 4.7 ± 3.3 years (1102 patient-years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Freedom from adverse outcomes was determined using log-rank calculations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Survival at 5 and 10 years was 98.7% ± 0.7% and 93.5% ± 5.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Freedom from reoperation (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes) on the aortic root was 92.2% ± 3.6% at 10 years; 3 reoperations were aortic valve replacement owing to structural valve deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Freedom from structural valve deterioration at 10 years was 96.1% ± 2.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found in survival (P = .805, P = .793, respectively), reoperation (P = .179, P = .973, respectively), structural valve deterioration (P = .639, P = .982, respectively), or any other functional or clinical endpoints when patients were stratified by valve type (tricuspid aortic valve vs <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo>) or associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the latest echocardiographic follow-up (95% complete), 202 patients (94.8%) had none or trace <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, 10 (4.7%) mild, 0 had moderate to severe, and 1 (0.5%) had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Freedom from greater than 2+ <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> at 10 years was 95.3% ± 2.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six patients sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (freedom at 10 years, 90.4% ± 5.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Tirone David reimplantation valve-sparing aortic root replacement in carefully selected young patients was associated with excellent clinical and echocardiographic outcome in patients with either a tricuspid aortic valve or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No demonstrable adverse influence was found for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> on durability, clinical outcome, or echocardiographic results </plain></SENT>
