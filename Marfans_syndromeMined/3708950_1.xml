<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several possible etiologies for this diastolic opening have been suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present a patient with hemodynamic data, M-mode and 2-D echocardiography in the setting of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> and diastolic aortic valve opening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our data lead us to conclude that aortic valve opening in this situation is neither from passive flotation nor dependent on atrial systole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We believe that active ventricular recoil mechanisms can facilitate increases in diastolic ventricular pressure which then can transiently exceed aortic pressure in the setting of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This hemodynamic observation suggests that the valve opening is an active process </plain></SENT>
