<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results of pediatric aortic valve replacements over 5 years were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Mechanical valves were used exclusively during the first part of this series (n = 26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, 25 consecutive aortic valve replacements were performed with autografts (n = 19) or allografts (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Allografts were used for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> patients or those with unusable pulmonary valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among autograft/allograft recipients, 16 patients underwent 27 prior operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the mechanical group, 18 patients underwent 19 previous operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients in each group underwent a previous mechanical aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Operative complications included two mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and one pacemaker in the autograft/allograft group and three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and two pacemakers in the mechanical group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One autograft recipient required reoperation for pulmonary allograft stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the mechanical group, late complications included six cases of nonstructural degeneration and two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, with three reoperations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Reoperation-free survival was 96% at 2 years in the autograft/allograft group and 80% at 2 years and 75% at 3 years in the mechanical group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Event-free survival was 96% at 2 years in the autograft/allograft group compared with 67% at 2 years and 49% at 3 years in the mechanical group (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of reoperations for mechanical aortic valve replacement has been surprisingly high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Aortic valve replacement in children with only autografts or allografts achieves good early results </plain></SENT>
