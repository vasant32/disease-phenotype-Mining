<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: There were 14 healthy children in the C group, 9 with inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e> (ICTD), and 6 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using standard echocardiographic equipment, the AO annulus, AO root diameter in systole (AO(S)) and diastole (AO(D)), and AO length (L) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The time taken for the Doppler signal to travel from the ascending to descending aorta was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AO peak flow was calculated from AO annulus cross-sectional area x peak aortic velocity (AoV); PWV = L/time taken for the Doppler signal to travel from the ascending to descending aorta; input impedance = (systolic - diastolic blood pressure)/(AO cross-sectional area x AoV); characteristic impedance = (PWV x rho)/Ao cross-sectional area (where rho = 1.06); and pressure strain elastic modulus = (systolic - diastolic blood pressure)/[(AO(S) - AO(D))/AO(D)]; beta index = ln (systolic/diastolic blood pressure)/[(AO(S) - AO(D))/AO(D)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results for PWV were ICTD = M &gt; C (533, 496, 362 cm/s; P &lt;.02); for input impedance were ICTD &gt; M = C (245, 120, 116; P &lt;.03); for characteristic impedance were ICTD &lt; M = C (249, 107, 142; P &lt;.05); for pressure strain elastic modulus were M &gt; ICTD = C (262, 447, 187; P &lt;.003); and for beta index were M &gt; ICTD &gt; C (2.91, 2.51, 2.13; P &lt;.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This novel, relatively simple method of assessing the biophysical properties of the aorta shows abnormal function in patients with M and ICTD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This technique may be helpful in the long-term follow up of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
