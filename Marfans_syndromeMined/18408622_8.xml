<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Electrocardiography (ECG) has been proposed as a method to enhance the ability of the preparticipation examination (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="53256">PPE</z:chebi>) to detect underlying cardiac conditions that can lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) in young athletes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a Medline review of the published medical literature, using the key terms of cardiovascular screening of athletes, ECG in athletes, SCD in athletes, and ECG in specific cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp>: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0158623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coronary artery anomalies</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948355" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial bridging</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ECG seems to increase the sensitivity of the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53256">PPE</z:chebi> from 2.5-6% to 50-95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall sensitivity appears to be about 50%; false-positive rates can be as high as 40%, and there is at least a 4-5% false-negative rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Europe, ECG-based screening programs have been associated with a decline in the SCD rate in young athletes, but similar programs are currently not recommended in the United States for many reasons: lack of randomized trial data; cost of screening; lack of a clear standard for ECG interpretation in the athlete; the likelihood that asymptomatic athletes with underlying lethal conditions might differ significantly from symptomatic individuals with the same conditions; and concern that ECG screening might actually increase the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate, via treatment-related procedural complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although some authorities advocate the use of ECG screening of young athletes, further studies are required to define what constitutes a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ECG in athletes, and to determine whether ECG-based screening protocols truly are superior, not only in finding disease, but also saving lives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For those who either choose ECG-based screening or interpret ECG in athletes, we propose a simple interpretation scheme and decision tree </plain></SENT>
