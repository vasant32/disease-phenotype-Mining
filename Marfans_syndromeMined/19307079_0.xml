<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: True <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> (AAA) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> is relatively rare because most <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> in this disease are dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in the thoracic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, its clinical characteristics and long-term outcome are still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined six patients (3 men, 3 women) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> who had a true AAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients underwent surgical treatment from 1972 to 2004, and we investigated the clinical and histologic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients were a median age of 45 years (range, 23-73 years) at the time of operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median maximum AAA diameter was 76 mm (range, 30-140 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two AAAs ruptured, one of which had twice undergone stent graft insertion before open repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was one anastomotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> with additional repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Marfan-related cardiac complications, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> found perioperatively or postoperatively, comprised three patients with annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> and four with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients died, including one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> during the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only slight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333205,C1260883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mural thrombus</z:e> was seen at nonruptured AAAs, and each surgical specimen of aneurysmal wall demonstrated significant cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in the tunica media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: True AAAs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> seemed to have several specific features, such as the tendency to occur in relatively young patients, lack of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333205,C1260883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mural thrombus</z:e>, and susceptibility to dissection and rupture, and the patients have poor life expectancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, careful follow-up, keeping these features in mind, is important to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> patients with a true AAA </plain></SENT>
