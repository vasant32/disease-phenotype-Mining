<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although progress has been achieved during the past decades in the management of patients with thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> by new surgical techniques, intraoperative monitoring of somatosensory-evoked potentials, and spinal cord fluid drainage, postoperative morbidity and mortality rates still remain high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The afflicted population is usually of older age and present at the time of operation with various comorbidities such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, obstructive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which with significant impact on surgical outcome </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this review we report on a promising alternative approach to the surgical treatment of thoracic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysms</z:hpo>, namely the currently emerging utilization of the endovascular stent-graft prosthesis in both thoracic and abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
