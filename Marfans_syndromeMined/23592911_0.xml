<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To identify the causative mutations in two Chinese families with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and to describe the associated phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Complete physical, ophthalmic, and cardiovascular examinations were given to the patients and unaffected individuals in the two families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exclusive linkage mapping was performed for transforming growth factor beta receptor II (TGFBR2) and fibrillin-1 (FBN1) loci in both families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The entire coding region and flanking splice sites of the FBN1 gene were screened for mutations in the two families with Sanger sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The potential mutations of FBN1 were tested in 100 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>Lens dislocation</z:hpo> was observed in two out of ten patients in the MF1 family and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in the MF2 family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the MF1 family displayed more severe cardiovascular and skeletal system involvement compared with the MF2 family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The transforming growth factor beta receptor II locus was excluded in both families by linkage analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A maximum multipoint lod score score of 2.83 was obtained for marker D15S992 (located in the FBN1 gene) in the MF1 family and 1.51 for the same marker in the MF2 family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two novel mutations of FBN1, p.C271* and p.C637Y, were identified in the MF1 and MF2 families, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Genotype-phenotype correlations in this study indicate that nonsense mutations of FBN1 may correlate with relatively severe systemic phenotypes when compared with cysteine substitutions, the most common type of FBN1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Genetic diagnosis for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> would help with genetic counseling, clinical intervention, and prognosis </plain></SENT>
