<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the gene for fibrillin-1 (FBN1) cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The majority of mutations are single-base changes, many of which exert their effect via a dominant-negative mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previously we have shown that an antisense hammerhead ribozyme, targeted to the FBN1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> can reduce deposition of fibrillin to the extracellular matrix of cultured fibroblasts, suggesting it may be possible to utilize ribozymes to down regulate the production of mutant protein and thus restore <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fibrillin function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This might be achieved by the mutation creating a ribozyme cleavage site that is not present in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> allele, however this is likely to limit the number of mutations that could be targeted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, it might be possible to target the mutant allele via the ribozyme binding arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To determine the potential of ribozymes to preferentially target mutant FBN1 alleles via the latter approach, the effect of mismatches in helix I of a hammerhead ribozyme, on the cleavage of fibrillin (FBN1) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A single base mismatch significantly reduced ribozyme cleavage efficiency both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The discrimination between fully-matched and mismatched ribozyme varied with the length of helix I, with the discrimination being more pronounced in ribozymes with a shorter helix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that it should be possible to design hammerhead ribozymes that can discriminate between closely related (mutant and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) target <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> varying in as little as a single nucleotide, even if the mutation does not create a ribozyme cleavage site </plain></SENT>
