<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Ideal perfusion during ascending aorta-arch surgery should allow easy implementation of antegrade cerebral perfusion while avoiding atheroembolization or false lumen perfusion in dissections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report favorable experience with direct axillary artery cannulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1999 and 2003, 284 patients with a mean age of 62.2 years (25 to 85), underwent axillary artery cannulation using a right angle wire-reinforced catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During this interval, attempted axillary cannulation was abandoned in only 14 patients because of inadequate backflow or other complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five patients were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Severe aortic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> or degeneration was present in 209, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in 63, and Marfan disease or <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp> in 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Bentall procedure was done in 144 patients, arch replacement in 86, the Yacoub procedure in 18, thoracoabdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> repair in 16, and coronary artery bypass grafting in 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reoperations were at 30.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Adverse outcome (hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) occurred in 6.6% (n = 19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (4.6%) died before hospital discharge, and 13 patients (4.6%; 9 of whom died) suffered permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transient neurologic dysfunction occurred in 9.2% (n = 26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e>, used in 246 patients, was 26 +/-7 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of antegrade cerebral perfusion, used in 139 patients, was 47 +/- 23 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In 93%, the right axillary artery was cannulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Complications included 2 cases (0.7%) of brachial plexus injury (one transient), and 3 (1%) of localized dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that axillary artery cannulation, successful in 95% of patients, may be the optimal technique for reducing perfusion-related morbidity and adverse outcome in operations for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection, atherosclerotic, and degenerative aneurysmal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It deserves serious consideration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients older than 65 requiring cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
