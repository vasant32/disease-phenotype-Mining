<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They were devided in two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First 7 cases were operated by original Bentall procedure with inclusion technique (group A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Succeeding 12 cases were operated by Carrel patch method or Cabrol procedure without inclusion maneuver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 2 operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in group A (28.6%) and was one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in group B (8.3%) respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of them required reoperation and another one with coronary ostial leakage died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We concluded that non-inclusion method for aortic root replacement was superior to conventional inclusion technique and reimplantation of both coronary ostia with Carrel patch method was the best tactics especially for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in terms of long term results </plain></SENT>
