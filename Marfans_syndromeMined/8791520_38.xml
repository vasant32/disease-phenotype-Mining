<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analysis of mutations in these disease types has provided new insights into microfibril assembly and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These include evidence for a mutation in a fibrillin 1 domain associated with severe phenotype; indication of profibrillin processing by a furin-like endoprotease; linkage between extracellular processing and fibrillin 1 polymerization; and involvement of calcium binding in monomer stabilization and microfibril assembly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Identification of intragenic DNA polymorphisms and determination of intron/exon junction sequences have significantly improved our ability to diagnose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and to detect fibrillin 1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional work has provided strong evidence for structural and functional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of microfibrillin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The evidence includes the identification of fibrillin 2, a microfibrillar component structurally related to fibrillin 1; the differential pattern of gene expression of the two fibrillin; and the association of fibrillin 2 mutations with congenital contractural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
