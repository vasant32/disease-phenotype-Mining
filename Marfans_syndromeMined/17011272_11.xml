<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital deformity</z:e> of the chest wall is <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo>, a malformation that is present in between 1 in 400 and 1 in 1000 live births and causes the body of the sternum to be displaced, producing a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are many different shapes of the pectus, and multiple factors probably contribute to the final form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> is uncertain, but a familial tendency has been found in clinical experience, where it may be seen in more than one sibling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>Pectus excavatum</z:hpo> is commonly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> such as Marfan and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers Danlos syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Extensive literature review failed to identify articles documenting families with multiple affected members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to collect evidence that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> is familial and may be an inherited disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using the Children's Surgical Specialty Group database at Children's Hospital of The King's Daughters, families with more than one affected individual were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With Institutional Review Board-approved informed consent, 34 families agreed to participate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Family histories were obtained, and a 4-generation pedigree was constructed for each family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Forty questions were asked about each individual's medical history, and comprehensive systems review included features of connective tissue-related problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>Inheritance</z:hpo> patterns for each family were determined by pedigree analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 14 families suggested <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant inheritance</z:hpo>, 4 families suggested <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive inheritance</z:hpo>, and 6 families suggested <z:hpo ids='HP_0001419'>X-linked recessive inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ten families had complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>Pectus excavatum</z:hpo> occurred more frequently in males than in females (1.8:1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Long arms, legs, and fingers; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000156'>high-arched palate</z:hpo>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>; heart <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>; double jointedness; flexibility; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001763'>flat feet</z:hpo>; childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo>; poor healing; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000978'>easy bruising</z:hpo> were commonly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pedigree analysis of 34 families provides evidence that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> is an inherited disorder, possibly of connective tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Although some families demonstrate apparent Mendelian <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo>, most appear to be multifactorial </plain></SENT>
