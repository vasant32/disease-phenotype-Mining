<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, the authors' clinical experience with three techniques is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between October 1994 and October 2000, 71 patients (46 men, 25 women; median age 53 years; range: 21-81 years) underwent aortic root reconstruction with preservation of the aortic valve and replacement of ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Factors that affected survival and need for subsequent aortic valve replacement were analyzed using univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Indications for operation were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in 65 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection in five, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with dissection in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty patients were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Presenting symptoms included <z:mp ids='MP_0001954'>shortness of breath</z:mp> in 16 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> in 14 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reimplantation technique was performed in 52 patients, remodeling technique in 14, and remodeling with sinus graft root replacement technique in five </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative echocardiography demonstrated absent to mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> in 63 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Operative mortality was 2.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival was 84.1% at 5 years; freedom from reoperation was 88.8% and 78.9% at one and three years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (21.2%) repaired by the implantation technique required aortic valve replacement secondary to <z:mp ids='MP_0006047'>aortic valve insufficiency</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>By univariate analysis, the necessity of aortic cusp repair (p = 0.0009), aortic annulus size &gt;25 mm (p = 0.04), and male gender (p = 0.04) were predictors for subsequent aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Aortic valve-preserving surgery is possible with a low morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The authors' experience shows a high failure rate in males with a large annulus needing aortic cusp repair and undergoing the reimplantation technique </plain></SENT>
