<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: A total of 31 eyes of 16 patients with subluxated lenses associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and a preoperative corrected visual acuity (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>) &lt; or =20/40 based on the Early Treatment Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> Study chart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were enrolled and the eye with worse visual acuity was randomly assigned to 1 of 2 study arms: phacoemulsification and iris-fixated PCIOL or phacoemulsification and iris-claw ACIOL; the second eye of the same patient received the other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative and postoperative ophthalmologic examination, optical coherence tomography, and endothelial cell counts were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We recorded <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> results at 3, 6, and 12 months, complications, endothelial cell loss, and central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the iris-fixated PCIOL group, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> was significantly improved at 3 (P = 0.011; n = 16), 6 (P = 0.006; n = 16), and 12 months (P = 0.002; n = 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the iris-claw ACIOL group, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> was significantly improved at 3 (P = 0.001; n=15), 6 (P = 0.001; n = 15), and 12 months (P = 0.009; n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> results did not differ significantly between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dislocation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e> occurred in 3 of 16 (18.75%) eyes in the PCIOL group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>Retinal detachment</z:hpo> occurred in 3 eyes (2 in the PCIOL group and 1 in the ACIOL group) and was successfully repaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Postoperative foveal tomograms in both groups revealed a decrease in the mean foveal thickness (MFT; &lt; or =172 microm) in 54.16% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The iris-sutured PCIOL and iris-claw ACIOL produced comparable improvements in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e> dislocation tended to occur more frequently in the iris-fixated PCIOL group, the difference was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At 6 months postoperatively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> study patients tended to have a thinner MFT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>None of the patients in either group developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011505'>cystoid macular edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
