<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He was unusually tall at 2 metres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An intravenous pyelogram and an abdominal ultrasound disclosed the presence of bilaterally <z:hpo ids='HP_0004716'>enlarged polycystic kidneys</z:hpo> and a polycystic liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> (180 micro mol/l) and blood pressure (150/100 mm Hg) were both raised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite good blood pressure control his renal function declined progressively and he started renal dialysis treatment in 1995 </plain></SENT>
