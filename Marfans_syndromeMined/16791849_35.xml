<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Very recently, heterozygous mutations in the genes encoding transforming growth factor beta receptors I (TGFBR1) and II (TGFBR2) have been reported in Loeys-Dietz <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> syndrome (LDS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, dominant TGFBR2 mutations have been identified in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> type 2 (MFS2) and familial thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and dissections (TAAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the past, mutations of these genes were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and several human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we report a total of nine novel and one known heterozygous sequence variants in the TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 genes in nine of 70 unrelated individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>-like phenotypes who previously tested negative for mutations in the gene encoding the extracellular matrix protein fibrillin-1 (FBN1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To assess the pathogenic impact of these sequence variants, in silico analyses were performed by the PolyPhen, SIFT, and Fold-X algorithms and by means of a 3D homology model of the TGFBR2 kinase domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one of the patients the pathogenic effect of at least one sequence variant is highly probable (c.722C &gt; T, c.799A &gt; C, and c.1460G &gt; A in TGFBR1 and c.773T &gt; G, c.1106G &gt; T, c.1159G &gt; A, c.1181G &gt; A, and c.1561T &gt; C in TGFBR2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These deleterious alleles occurred de novo or segregated with the disease in the families, indicating a causative association between the sequence variants and clinical phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since TGFBR2 mutations found in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>-related disorders cannot be distinguished from heterozygous TGFBR2 mutations reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples, we emphasize the importance of segregation analysis in affected families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In order to be able to find the mutation that is indeed responsible for a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>-related phenotype, we also propose that genetic testing for sequence alterations in TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 should be complemented by mutation screening of the FBN1 gene </plain></SENT>
