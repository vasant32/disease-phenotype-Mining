<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The initial aortic pathological condition included the following: fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> due to medial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1285162" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">degenerative disease</z:e> in 34 patients, 12 of whom had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in a previously undilated aorta in 23; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> persisting or occurring after brachiocephalic bypass in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One of the latter had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> because of <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Various operations initially performed did not completely treat the disease, and certain complications occurred spontaneously, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The residual pathological condition led to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0542052" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary artery insufficiency</z:e>, and progressive aneurysmal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These complications were treated by composite valve graft replacement of the aortic valve and ascending aorta or the transverse aortic arch or both, simple aortic valve replacement, graft replacement of the ascending aorta or arch or both, and suture of false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with viable tissue wrap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (34%) had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the distal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The entire aorta was replaced in 3, thoracoabdominal segments in 9, and the abdominal aorta in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 59 patients, 49 (83%) were early survivors and 40 (68%) were alive on January 1, 1985 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Principles of therapy that may have prevented the complications leading to reoperation include <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> replacement at the time of aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass; total replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic valve in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>; the same procedure or aortic valve replacement and separate graft replacement in patients with non-Marfan's medial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1285162" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">degenerative disease</z:e>; ascending aortic replacement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with dissection combined with valve resuspension, aortic valve replacement, or composite valve graft depending on the involvement of the aortic sinuses and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
