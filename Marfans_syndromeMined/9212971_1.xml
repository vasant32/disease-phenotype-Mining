<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Femoral inflow and outflow cannulas were inserted percutaneously after induction of anesthesia with the patient in supine position, and low flow normothermic bypass was established before thoracotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Next the patient was placed in a right lateral position to create an operating field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With this body position and even an almost prone position, which was sometimes necessary for easy dissection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adhesion of lung</z:e> to the aneurysmal wall, the bypass flow was easily maintained adequately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The bypass circuit was coated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, and the activated clotting time (ACT) was controlled to be between 150 and 200 s during the entire operating period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous insertion of the cannulas avoided local <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in the groin, and the low ACT made control of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in the operating field easy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For descending aortic surgery, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-coated percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass proved to be a useful adjunctive measure </plain></SENT>
