<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When TAAD occurs in the absence of syndromic features, it is inherited in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> manner with decreased penetrance and variable expression, the disease is referred to as familial TAAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Familial TAAD exhibits significant clinical and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first genes identified to cause TAAD were FBN1, TGFBR2, and TGFBR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The identification and characterization of these genes suggested that increased TGF-beta signaling plays a role in pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The recent discovery that mutations in the vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC)-specific beta-myosin (MYH11) and alpha-actin (ACTA2) can also cause this disorder has focused attention on the importance of the maintenance of SMC contractile function in preserving aortic structure and preventing TAAD </plain></SENT>
