<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Information about long-term follow-up is limited, and possible predictors for failure of reconstruction have not been evaluated so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After aortic valve reimplantation 101 patients were followed in a prospective observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From this cohort the first 75 consecutive patients with a complete 1-year follow-up were chosen for further analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and echocardiographic data were obtained preoperatively, intraoperatively, and early postoperatively, as well as after 1 year of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No mortality was observed within the first 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 52 male patients, mean age was 49.1+/-20.6 years, observation period was 35.6+/-20.6 months, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> was present in 22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although in 67 patients a stable valve function could be demonstrated, 5 patients presented with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> or had to be operated on again for secondary valve failure (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analyzing possible demographic, disease-related, and procedure-related risk factors in a multivariable approach, only level of coaptation within the graft (as assessed by echocardiography) could be identified as being related to the subsequent development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Coaptation level within the tube graft (type A) resulted in a mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> grade of 0.3+/-0.5 as compared with a mean grade of 2.5+/-0.6 for a coaptation type C (below the prosthesis; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aortic valve reimplantation is a promising alternative to alloprosthetic composite replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A level of coaptation within the tube graft is essential to achieve valve competence </plain></SENT>
