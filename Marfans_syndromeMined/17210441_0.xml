<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present a case of recurrent anterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0003834'>shoulder dislocation</z:hpo> in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> who presented with hyperlaxity that has been treated arthroscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We discuss abnormal findings at arthroscopic evaluation, including complete absence of the mid anterior capsule, which left the subscapularis uncovered, and we hypothesize that repetitive trauma to the capsule was not followed by a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> process of remodeling because of a lack of competent elastic fibers and a poor capacity for soft tissue healing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The inferior insertion of the labrum and the inferior glenohumeral ligament seemed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> through the large volume of the pouch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed arthroscopic reconstruction of the capsule through dissection of its anteroinferior part with a radiofrequency wand from the glenoid rim and the subscapularis, followed by superior drift of the capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Weitbrecht foramen was then closed with 2 nonresorbable No. 4 sutures, and the capsule was reinserted to the labrum with 2 anchors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A final suture closed the remaining hole in the rotator interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 16-month follow-up, the patient emphasized her satisfaction with the results; she was able to keep up with her regular schedule of leisure sports and swimming, painlessly, with no limitations or new episodes of instability </plain></SENT>
