<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A hundred patients (71 males and 29 females) with a MH and ID were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Custom-designed 244K array-CGH (AgilentÂ®; Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA) and MED12, ZDHHC9, UPF3B, FBN1, TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 sequencing analyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighty patients could be classified as isolated MH and ID: 12 chromosomal imbalances, 1 FBN1 mutation and 1 possibly pathogenic MED12 mutation were found (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients could be classified as ID with other extra-skeletal features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) spectrum: 4 pathogenic FBN1 mutations and 4 chromosomal imbalances were found (2 patients with both FBN1 mutation and chromosomal rearrangement) (29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest either that there are more loci with genes yet to be discovered or that MH can also be a relatively non-specific feature of patients with ID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The search for aortic complications is mandatory even if MH is associated with ID since FBN1 mutations or rearrangements were found in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The excess of males is in favour of the involvement of other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although it was impossible to make a diagnosis in 80% of patients, these results will improve genetic counselling in families </plain></SENT>
