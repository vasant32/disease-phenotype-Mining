<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Degenerative changes were seen in the elastic tissue fibers in patient's with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>; they varied from mild to severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Elastic fibers in the lungs of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000973'>cutis laxa</z:hpo> showed by light and electron microscopy the same morphologic changes previously reported in the skin and vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While the alterations in individual elastic fibers in the alveolar septa appeared similar, in cutix laxa there was severe involvement of almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fibers, whereas in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> the involvement was not so severe, nor did it affect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On examination of lung sections from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000973'>cutis laxa</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, both were readily separable from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal controls </plain></SENT>
