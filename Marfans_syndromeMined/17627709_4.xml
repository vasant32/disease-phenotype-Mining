<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Past research has focused on younger patients as lifespan was known to be significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aims to describe the complications, including those affecting the eyes, heart and musculoskeletal system, faced by older survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 2500 patient records from the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan Syndrome</z:e> Clinical Database were searched for suitable participants aged 50 or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred and fifty-six questionnaires were posted to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These patients were sent a detailed questionnaire regarding medical aspects of their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Those included in the study were sent questionnaires for spouses and friends (not blood relatives) to complete, to provide control data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other age- and sex-matched controls were recruited locally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty questionnaires from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> (35%) were returned and eligible for inclusion in the study, comprising 28 female patients and 32 male patients with a median age of 57 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We recruited 56 eligible controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results revealed that patients over 50 years of age with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> may be at a higher risk than previously assumed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> (reported by 24% of our respondents) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001626'>cardiovascular abnormalities</z:hpo> (42% have had past aortic surgery; 53% report palpitation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lesser known complications were also reported, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> (reported by 27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Medical practitioners should be aware of the range of complications that can occur in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> in addition to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ageing process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Health problems in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients over 50 may require investigation and specific therapy earlier than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ageing population, because of the degenerative nature of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic condition</z:e> </plain></SENT>
