<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have studied the synthesis of fibrillin and decorin in cultured fibroblasts of a further <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> patient with neonatally lethal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin immunoreactivity in the extracellular matrix of the patient's fibroblasts was markedly reduced, and the fibrillar pattern was absent, in spite of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> amounts of fibrillin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Decorin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, synthesis, and immunoreactivity in the matrix were also reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results indicate involvement of both fibrillin and decorin in the pathogenesis of neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> in this patient, but do not indicate which is the primary defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We speculate, however, that a structural defect of fibrillin leads to diminished incorporation of the protein into the extracellular matrix, and that underexpression of decorin is secondary to the primary fibrillin defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combined deficiency of fibrillin and decorin may be the cause of the severe clinical phenotype </plain></SENT>
