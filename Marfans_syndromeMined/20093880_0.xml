<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE: A 29-year-old woman with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002655'>spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia</z:hpo> congenita and her 30-year-old husband with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> underwent in vitro fertilization with preimplantation genetic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two mutation-negative embryos were transferred into a gestational carrier, who became pregnant with twins and delivered two clinically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Statistically, this couple would be predicted to have a 75% chance of producing an affected embryo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using preimplantation genetic diagnosis, two dually unaffected embryos were selected and transferred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This experience expands the use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis to cases with multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> single-gene disorders </plain></SENT>
