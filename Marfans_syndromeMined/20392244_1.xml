<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent genetic evidence implicates extracellular fibrillin assemblies (microfibrils and elastic fibers) in imparting contextual specificity to endogenous transforming growth factor-beta and bone morphogenetic protein ligands in the forming and mature skeleton </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The evidence is based on the characterization of the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the unique bone manifestations that characterize mouse models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and congenital contractural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Collectively, the studies indicate that fibrillin assemblies play a key role both in establishing morphogen gradients within the developing limbs and in restricting growth factors activity in remodeling bones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The latter finding is likely to improve the design of more effective therapeutic interventions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> and of bioengineering formulations for the repair of bone fractures </plain></SENT>
