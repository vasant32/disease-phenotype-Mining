<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>People with CCA typically have a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001519'>marfanoid habitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>flexion contractures</z:hpo>, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002751'>kyphoscoliosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000356'>abnormal pinnae</z:hpo>, and muscular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of the relative infrequency of the syndrome and its generally mild to moderate severity, prenatal diagnosis had not previously been sought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we report prenatal diagnosis in a family with CCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because the course of the disease in the proband was rather severe, she had requested genetic counseling as early as age 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She delayed childbearing until prenatal diagnosis for CCA became possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This decision was supported by her mother and later her husband </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because she shared the same genotype with her husband, genetic linkage analysis of this family did not alter the a priori 50% risk of having an affected child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The possibility of unambiguously ascertaining the affected status of a fetus homozygous for the tested FBN2 marker was sufficient for the family to pursue prenatal diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This case strongly points to the importance of informed decisions now that genetic testing is becoming commonplace </plain></SENT>
