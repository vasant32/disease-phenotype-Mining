<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The initial operation was the modified Bentall procedure, in which the root of the ascending aorta and the aortic valve were replaced with a composite graft with a prosthetic mechanical valve, and the coronary arteries were reconstructed by direct anastomosis to the right coronary ostium or with an interposing graft to the left coronary ostium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 1 year and 6 months after the initial operation, a pseudoaneurysm developed in the ascending aorta following the reconstructed coronary ostium on the right side was detached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At reoperation, the hole in the composite graft was closed, but the right coronary artery could not be reconstructed </plain></SENT>
