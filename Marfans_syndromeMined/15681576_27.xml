<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of pregnancy on growth of the aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 1993 and 2004 127 women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> were prospectively followed; 61 women had one or more children; in 23 women, 33 pregnancies could be followed prospectively for aortic dimensions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only one woman had suffered an aortic complication, a type A dissection (limited to the ascending aorta), before pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Out of 66 childless women a comparison group of 22 women was selected and individually matched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean initial aortic root diameter just before pregnancy was 37+/-5 mm (range 25-45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Before, during, and after pregnancy the overall individual aortic root diameter change (in 31 pregnancies) was not significant (P=0.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only the woman with a previous type A dissection developed an aortic complication (type B dissection) during her second pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No cardiac complications occurred in the other 22 women during their pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 6.4 years, no significant difference in growth of the aortic root was observed between the pregnancy group and the matched childless group (0.28 vs. 0.19 mm/year, P=0.08, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pregnancy in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> seems to be relatively safe up to an aortic root diameter of 45 mm, at least as far as our observed diameter range of 25-45 mm is concerned </plain></SENT>
