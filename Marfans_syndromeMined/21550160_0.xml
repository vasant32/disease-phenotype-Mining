<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Several aortic valve sparing techniques have been described for the treatment of aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our experience using the reimplantation technique in 120 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between March 2004 and October 2010, 120 patients with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> underwent David operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 51 were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean patient age was 31 ± 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean diameter of the sinuses of Valsalva was 51 ± 5 mm and moderate/severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> was present in 16% of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the other 69 patients mean age was 56 ± 14 years, the mean diameter of the sinuses of Valsalva was 53 ± 7 mm and moderate/severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> was present in 66% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> was presented in 14 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hospital mortality was 1.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 37 ± 21 months; 94% of the patients survived and 96% had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> below grade II during 5 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient required re-operation because of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> or thromboembolic complications have been documented, and 96% of the patients did not receive any anticoagulation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Short- and mid-term results with the reimplantation technique for aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This technique prevents the need for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> anticoagulation treatment as well as the complications arising from mechanical prostheses, and it should be the treatment of choice for young patients </plain></SENT>
