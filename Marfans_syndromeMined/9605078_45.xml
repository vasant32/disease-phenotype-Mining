<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The experience, rationale, and development of a valve-preserving technique introduced and used since 1979 is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During this period 158 patients (78% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing resection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta) were operated on using this technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their ages ranged from 2 to 72 years (mean 46.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the patients 107 were male and 51 were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 68 patients had skeletal manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The original disease was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta or root in 92 (58.2%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection in 17 (10.8%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection in 49 (31%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One hundred eleven additional procedures were performed in 84 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> there were five early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (4.6% +/- 2%) in the 109 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the 103 patients operated on electively (0.97% +/- 0.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival for patients operated on for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was 93.3%, 88.0%, 79.0%, and 57.9% at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years and 96.8%, 91.2%, 82.0%, and 60.0% for those operated on electively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival for patients operated on for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection was 72.8%, 63.4%, and 53.3% at 1, 5, and 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The probability of needing reoperation was 3.0% +/- 2%, 11% +/- 0.5%, and 11% +/- 0.5% at 1, 5, and 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no instances of infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> or thromboembolic complications except in two patients operated on early in the series who had cusp extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography showed reduction in left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions, which was maintained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>At the end of follow-up trivial or no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> was demonstrated in 63.6%, mild to moderate in 33.3%, and severe in 3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Valve-sparing operations are possible in a large proportion of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta and the medium and long-term results are encouraging </plain></SENT>
