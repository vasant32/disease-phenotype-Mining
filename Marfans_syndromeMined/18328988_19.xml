<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both disorders have benefited from recent advances in clinical and molecular characterization, allowing improvements in clinical diagnosis and management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EDS are a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of conditions characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000974'>skin hyperextensibility</z:hpo>, atrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001382'>joint hypermobility</z:hpo> and generalized tissue fragility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The current classification proposes six subtypes based on clinical, biochemical and molecular characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, examples of unclassified variants and 'overlap phenotypes' are becoming more common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutations in genes encoding fibrillar collagens or collagen-modifying enzymes have been identified in most forms of EDS, including the classic and vascular subtypes (collagen type V and III, respectively), and the rare arthrochalasis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002751'>kyphoscoliosis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="EDS7A|EDS8C|EDS7">dermatosparaxis</z:e> variants (type I collagen defects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To date, the genetic background of the hypermobility type of EDS remains unclear, although some new insights have been gained recently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal-dominant</z:hpo> disorder that affects the cardiovascular, ocular and skeletal system with aortic root dilation/dissection, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> and bone <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Advances in therapeutic, mainly surgical, techniques have improved median survival significantly, yet severe morbidity and a substantial risk for premature mortality remain associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The disorder is caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene, encoding the microfibrillar protein fibrillin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recently, new insights in the pathogenesis changed the prevailing concept of this type 1 fibrillinopathy as a structural disorder of the connective tissue into a developmental abnormality manifesting perturbed cytokine signalling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings have opened new and unexpected targets for aetiologically directed drug treatments </plain></SENT>
