<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare results of total root replacement versus valve-sparing aortic root replacement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase and Cochrane library were searched from January 1966 until February 2010 looking for papers reporting on aortic root operations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>530 studies were retrieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STUDY SELECTION: Finally, 11 publications were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were observational studies reporting valve-related morbidity and mortality after total root replacement (TTR) and/or valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and study size nâ‰¥30, reflecting the centre's experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DATA EXTRACTION: Data obtained from papers reporting both TRR and VSRR cohorts were analysed separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In case of multiple publications, the most recent and complete report was selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If the total number of patient-years was not provided, we calculated it by multiplying the number of hospital survivors with the mean follow-up duration of that study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 1,385 patients were analysed (972 patients had TTR and 413 patients had VSRR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reintervention rate was 0.3%/year (95% CI 0.1 to 0.5) versus 1.3%/year (95% CI 0.3 to 2.2) (p=0.02) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> rate was 0.7%/year (95% CI 0.5 to 0.9) versus 0.3%/year (95% CI 0.1 to 0.6) (p=0.01) after TRR and VSRR, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When composite valve-related events were compared, no difference existed between the two surgical strategies (p=0.41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among patients undergoing VSRR, reimplantation was associated with a reduced rate of reintervention compared with remodelling (0.7%/year vs 2.4%/year, p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: VSRR may represent a valuable option for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, this technique should be used with caution in patients with valve characteristics at risk for decreased durability </plain></SENT>
