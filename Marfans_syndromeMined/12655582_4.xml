<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To use noninvasive magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM) to examine aneurysmal disease in the mouse model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of eight <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> mice were imaged using MRM; four of them at three different time points over an 8-week period and the remaining animals were imaged at one time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The maximal cross-sectional area of the aorta was measured by manual tracing and by automated means from combined cardiac and respiratory-gated bright-blood images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relationships between aortic size and age and the differences between WT and mutant mice aortic size were established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Maximal cross-sectional aortic areas differed significantly (P &lt; 0.05) between WT and mutant mice for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> mice having larger aortic size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a positive correlation between aortic size and age in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> mice (r = 0.80) with a significant increase from the 14th to the 22nd week (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MRM detected the differences in aortic size between WT and mutant mice over time, demonstrating a potential for noninvasive technique for the assessment of potential therapies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> mice </plain></SENT>
