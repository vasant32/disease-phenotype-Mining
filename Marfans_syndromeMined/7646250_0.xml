<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The results of 51 patients undergoing the Bentall procedure for aneurysmal pathology of the ascending aorta during the last 10 years are analysed with respect to the nature of the pathology of the lesions of the arterial wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study population comprised 39 men and 12 women with a mean age of 47 +/- 17 years (range 2-76 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were divided into two groups, Group I (n = 38) with degenerative cystic medianecrosis, Group II (n = 13) with atheromatous lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall results were satisfactory with a hospital mortality of 3.9% and 5 and 10 year survival rates of 94 and 74% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No difference in results was observed with respect to the anatomical site of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, the presence of dissection or the technique used for repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results in degenerative lesions (Group I) were excellent but the accent should be placed on prevention to reduce the number of patients operated in a context of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of atheromatous lesions identifies a high risk group (Group II) due to advanced age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and associated vascular and coronary lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hospital mortality in this group was 15.4% compared to almost nil when the aneurysmal pathology was due to degenerative lesions of the media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The extramortality of this group is directly related to the presence of atheromatous lesions (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267406" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mesenteric infarction</z:e> due to atheromatous embolism) and incites special attention to the mesenteric sphere in the postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The preoperative work-up should include transoesophageal echocardiography of the thoracic aortic wall, probably the source of the postoperative emboli </plain></SENT>
