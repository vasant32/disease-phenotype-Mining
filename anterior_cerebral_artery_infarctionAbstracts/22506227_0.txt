Crossed aphasia refers to language disturbance due to right-hemisphere lesions in right-handed individuals, while magnetic apraxia is described as 'forced grasping and groping' caused by lesions in the contralateral frontal lobe. This is a case report of a 70-year-old right handed woman who suffered from crossed transcortical motor aphasia and left hand magnetic apraxia due to right anterior cerebral artery infarction. The definite mechanism of this disorder is not yet understood, but neurophysiological observations suggest that affected supplementary motor areas may be responsible for this phenomenon.
