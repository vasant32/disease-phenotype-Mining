OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to apply the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health - Child and Youth (ICF-CY) framework to identify the factors related to the participation of children with autism. METHOD: A convenience sample included 162 preschool children with autism ages 36 to 72 months. The raters collected data using the ICF-CY-based questionnaire as an instrument to construct the structural equation modeling of factors associated with participation. RESULTS: The internal structure of the model was acceptable, indicating that the observed variables would suffice in accounting for latent variables. The structural model showed that the performance of participation in children with autism was influenced by body functions and personal factors. All the variables accounted for 77% of the explained variance for activities and for participation by 71% of the children with autism. CONCLUSION: These findings may provide critical information pertaining to predictive factors of participation for parents, educators, and professionals who work with children with autism.
