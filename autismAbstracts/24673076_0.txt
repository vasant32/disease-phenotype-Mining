OBJECTIVE: To observe the efficacy of encephalopathy therapeutic tongue acupoint apparatus (ETTAA) in the treatment of autism. METHODS: Eighty-four children of autism were randomly divided into a tongue acupuncture group (group A) and a conventional training group (group B), 42 cases in each group. The behavior training and sensory integration training were carried out in group B and the ETTAA was added in group A. The apparatus was switched on for 20 min every time and 3 times a day. Treatment of two months were carried out in both groups. The score of childhood autism rating scale (CARS) and clinical efficacy in both groups were observed before and after treatment. RESULTS: After treatment, the CARS in both groups were significantly reduced (42.39 +/- 6.86 vs 32.15 +/- 5.12, P < 0.001; 44.58 +/- 6.76 vs 39.72 +/- 7.11, P < 0.05), which was more significant in group A (P < 0.01). The totally effective rate in group A [90.5% (38/42)] was superior to that in group B [66.7% (28/42), P < 0.01]. CONCLUSION: The clinical efficacy in tongue acupuncture group is apparently superior to that in conventional training group, ETTAA combined with conventional training have a better curative effect in the treatment of autism.
