 OBJECTIVE: To review the published literature and registered clinical trials on pharmacologic interventions targeting social communication impairment in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). METHODS: A comprehensive search of several databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Clinical trials.gov) was conducted to identify pharmacologic agents that have been, or will be, tested as treatments for social communication impairment in individuals with ASD. Evidence from basic science research supporting rational drug discovery is surveyed. RESULTS: Data from animal models and early clinical trials suggest that novel and existing compounds, including N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) modulators, Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonists, metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) antagonists and neuropeptides, may enhance social communication/function in ASD. Results from numerous Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials are expected in the near future. CONCLUSIONS: Recent evidence suggests that social communication may be an appropriate target for pharmacologic manipulation. It is hoped that, in combination with behavioural interventions, novel therapeutics may soon be clinically available to help improve social outcomes.
