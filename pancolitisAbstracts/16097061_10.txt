 AIM: The role of the appendix has been highlighted in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC). The aims of this study were to elucidate the immuno-imbalances in the appendix of UC patients, and to clarify the role of the appendix in the development of UC. METHODS: Colonoscopic biopsy specimens of the appendix, transverse colon, and rectum were obtained from 86 patients with UC: active pancolitis (A-Pan; n = 15), active left-sided colitis (A-Lt; n = 25), A-Lt with appendiceal involvement (A-Lt/Ap; n = 10), inactive pancolitis (I-Pan; n = 14), and inactive left-sided colitis (I-Lt; n = 22), and from controls. In the isolated mucosal T cells, the CD4/CD8 ratio and proportion of activated CD4+ T cells were investigated, and compared with controls. RESULTS: In the appendix, the CD4/CD8 ratio significantly increased in A-Lt and A-Lt/Ap. The ratio in the appendix also tended to increase in A-Pan. In the rectum, the ratio significantly increased in all UC groups. In the appendix, the proportion of CD4+CD69+ (early activation antigen) T cells significantly increased in all UC groups. In the rectum, the proportion of CD4+CD69+ T cells significantly increased only in A-Pan. The proportion of CD4+HLA-DR+ (mature activation antigen) T cells significantly increased only in the rectum of A-Pan, but not in the other areas of any groups. CONCLUSION: The increased CD4/CD8 ratio and predominant infiltration of CD4+CD69+ T cells in the appendix suggest that the appendix is a priming site in the development of UC.
