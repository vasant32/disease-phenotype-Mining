<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: A single-center prospective nonrandomized cohort study was performed to investigate the safety of irreversible electroporation (IRE) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> ablation in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight volunteers with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> of the liver, kidney, or lung (69 separate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>) unresponsive to alternative treatment were subjected to IRE under general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical examination, biochemistry, and computed tomography (CT) scans of the treated organ were performed before, immediately after, and at 1 month and 3 months after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No mortalities occurred at 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> occurred in four patients, and electrocardiographically (ECG) synchronized delivery was used subsequently in the remaining 30 patients, with two further <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient developed obstruction of the upper ureter after IRE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One adrenal gland was unintentionally directly electroporated, which produced transient severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no other evidence of adjacent organ damage related to the electroporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other adverse events were not directly related to IRE, but two patients developed temporary neurapraxia as a result of arm extension during a prolonged period of anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although not a primary aim of this preliminary study, complete target <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> ablation verified by CT was achieved in 46 of the 69 tumors treated with IRE (66%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most treatment failures occurred in renal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100526'>lung tumors</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Biopsy in three patients showed coagulative <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in the regions treated by IRE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IRE appears to be safe for human clinical use provided ECG-synchronized delivery is used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Comparative evaluation with alternative ablative technologies is warranted </plain></SENT>
