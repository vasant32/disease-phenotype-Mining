<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experimental and clinical studies point at two major mechanisms involved in the intrinsically progressive nature of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first consists of a change in the electrical properties of the atrium, notably a shortening of the AERP and a loss of rate adaptation, and hence was named electrical remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, based on data from is experimental models, it has been considered that AF is also associated with elaborate adaptive and maladaptive changes in tissue and cellular architecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By parallel, this type of change was denominated structural remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Together, these mechanisms will increase the probability of generating multiple atrial wavelets by enabling rapid atrial activation and dispersion of refractoriness </plain></SENT>
