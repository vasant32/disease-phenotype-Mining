<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies in the young are rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to capture the symptoms and signs reported by patients with cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> before the patients or their attending clinicians knew the final diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective case-note review of 35 consecutive unrelated gene-positive probands with a proven cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1720983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">channelopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The presentation leading to diagnosis of cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1720983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">channelopathy</z:e> was resuscitated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> in 7 patients; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> in 20; collapse with retained consciousness in 2; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> in 1 and an incidental finding in 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> (LQTS 18, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> 2), median age at presentation was 13.9 years (1.8 day to 40.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 17 patients able to describe the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, 11 (65%) had at least one symptom prior to collapse, though none reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dizziness or lightheadedness was the most frequent symptom, being experienced by 8 (47%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine (of 20) patients (45%) had witnessed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-like activity and 8 (40%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients were capable of describing the post-syncopal period, of whom 15 (79%) reported symptoms, the most common (12; 65%) being <z:hpo ids='HP_0002329'>drowsiness</z:hpo> or exhaustion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> in the young frequently presents with symptoms and signs that are typically associated with other causes of transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo>, including vasovagal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The presence of symptoms may not be as helpful in differentiating arrhythmic from non-arrhythmic events as is often supposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A thorough history, appropriate investigations and a high index of suspicion remain essential in the assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
