<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Hybrid therapy with catheter ablation of the cavo-tricuspid isthmus (CTI) and continuation of anti-arrhythmic drugs (AAD), or electrical cardioversion with AADs might be alternative treatments for patients with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of study was to assess the long term success rate of hybrid therapy for persistent AF compared to antiarrhythmic medication therapy after electrical cardioversion and identify the independent risk factors associated with recurrence after hybrid therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 32 patients with persistent AF who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> after the administration of a class Ic or III anti-arrhythmic drug were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This group was compared with a group (33 patients) who underwent cardioversion and received direct current cardioversion with AADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline data were collected, and electrocardiogram and symptom driven Holter monitoring were performed every 2-4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 12 month atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> free survival was better in the hybrid group, 49.0% vs. 33.1%, p=0.048 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, during a mean 55.7+/- 43.0 months of follow up, the improved survival rate regressed (p=0.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A larger left atrium size was an independent risk factor for the recurrence of AF after adjusting for confounding factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite favorable outcome during 12 month, the CTI block with AADs showed outcomes similar to AAD therapy after electrical cardioversion over a 12 month follow up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Minimal substrate modification with AADs might be an alternative treatment for persistent AF with minimal atrial remodeling </plain></SENT>
