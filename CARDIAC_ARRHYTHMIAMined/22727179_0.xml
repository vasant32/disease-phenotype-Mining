<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ChHD is associated with ventricular tachyarrhythmias and an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although ChHD is a common form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in Latin American <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> users, little is known about its efficacy in the treatment of this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study cohort included 116 consecutive patients with ChHD and an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implanted for secondary prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 116 patients, 83 (72%) were men; the mean age was 54 ± 10.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several clinical variables were tested in a multivariate Cox model for predicting long-term mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average follow-up was 45 ± 32 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>New York Heart Association class I-II developed in 83% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 42 ± 16% at implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 116 patients, 58 (50%) had appropriate shocks and 13 (11%) had inappropriate therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A total of 31 patients died (7.1% annual mortality rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>New York Heart Association class III (hazard ratio [HR] 3.09, 95% confidence interval 1.37 to 6.96, p = 0.0064) was a predictor of a worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The left ventricular ejection fraction (HR 0.972, 95% confidence interval 0.94 to 0.99, p = 0.0442) and low cumulative right ventricular pacing (HR 0.23, 95% confidence interval 0.11 to 0.49, p = 0.0001) were predictors of better survival </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>New York Heart Association class III and left ventricular ejection fraction were independent predictors of worse prognosis, and low cumulative right ventricular pacing defined better survival </plain></SENT>
