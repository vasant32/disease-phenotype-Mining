<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Optical imaging and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39442">fluorescent probes</z:chebi> have significantly advanced research methodology in the field of cardiac electrophysiology in ways that could not have been accomplished by other approaches(1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the use of the calcium- and voltage-sensitive dyes, optical mapping allows measurement of transmembrane action potentials and calcium transients with high spatial resolution without the physical contact with the tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This makes measurements of the cardiac electrical activity possible under many conditions where the use of electrodes is inconvenient or impossible(1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For example, optical recordings provide accurate morphological changes of membrane potential during and immediately after stimulation and defibrillation, while conventional electrode techniques suffer from stimulus-induced artifacts during and after stimuli due to electrode polarization(1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Langendorff-perfused rabbit heart is one of the most studied models of human heart <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> and pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> observed clinically could be recapitulated in the rabbit heart model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was shown that wave patterns in the rabbit heart during <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, determined by effective size of the heart and the wavelength of reentry, are very similar to that in the human heart(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was also shown that critical aspects of excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in rabbit myocardium, such as the relative contribution of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), is very similar to human EC coupling(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Here we present the basic procedures of optical mapping experiments in Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts, including the Langendorff perfusion system setup, the optical mapping systems setup, the isolation and cannulation of the heart, perfusion and dye-staining of the heart, excitation-contraction uncoupling, and collection of optical signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These methods could be also applied to the heart from species other than rabbit with adjustments to flow rates, optics, solutions, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two optical mapping systems are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The panoramic mapping system is used to map the entire epicardium of the rabbit heart(4-7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This system provides a global view of the evolution of reentrant circuits during arrhythmogenesis and defibrillation, and has been used to study the mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and antiarrhythmia therapy(8,9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The dual mapping system is used to map the action potential (AP) and calcium transient (CaT) simultaneously from the same field of view(10-13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This approach has enhanced our understanding of the important role of calcium in the electrical alternans and the induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>(14-16) </plain></SENT>
