<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These guidelines are based on small studies that associated low <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> levels with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the pre-β-blocker and prereperfusion era </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Current studies examining the relationship between <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> levels and mortality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> patients are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between serum <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> levels and in-hospital mortality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> patients in the era of β-blocker and reperfusion therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Retrospective cohort study using the Cerner Health Facts database, which included 38,689 patients with biomarker-confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>, admitted to 67 US hospitals between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had in-hospital serum <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> measurements and were categorized by mean postadmission serum <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> level (&lt;3.0, 3.0-&lt;3.5, 3.5-&lt;4.0, 4.0-&lt;4.5, 4.5-&lt;5.0, 5.0-&lt;5.5, and ≥5.5 mEq/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hierarchical logistic regression was used to determine the association between <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> levels and outcomes after adjusting for patient- and hospital-level factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>-cause in-hospital mortality and the composite of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a U-shaped relationship between mean postadmission serum <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> level and in-hospital mortality that persisted after multivariable adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with the reference group of 3.5 to less than 4.0 mEq/L (mortality rate, 4.8%; 95% CI, 4.4%-5.2%), mortality was comparable for mean postadmission <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> of 4.0 to less than 4.5 mEq/L (5.0%; 95% CI, 4.7%-5.3%), multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.19 (95% CI, 1.04-1.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mortality was twice as great for <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> of 4.5 to less than 5.0 mEq/L (10.0%; 95% CI, 9.1%-10.9%; multivariable-adjusted OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.68-2.36), and even greater for higher <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> strata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Similarly, mortality rates were higher for <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> levels of less than 3.5 mEq/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> were higher only among patients with <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> levels of less than 3.0 mEq/L and at levels of 5.0 mEq/L or greater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Among inpatients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>, the lowest mortality was observed in those with postadmission serum <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> levels between 3.5 and &lt;4.5 mEq/L compared with those who had higher or lower <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
