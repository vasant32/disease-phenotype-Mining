<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It associates with reduced exercise capacity, increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine retrospectively whether pravastatin reduces the incidence of AF and whether any electrocardiographic measures or clinical conditions might be risk factors for its development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER) was a randomized, double-blind controlled trial that recruited 5804 individuals aged 70-82 years with a history of, or risk factors for, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 2891 were allocated to pravastatin and 2913 to placebo; mean follow-up was 3.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiograms (ECGs), which were recorded at baseline, annually thereafter, and at run-out, were processed by computer and reviewed manually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 264 of 2912 (9.1%) of the placebo group and 283 of 2888 (9.8%) of the pravastatin-treated group developed AF [hazard ratio 1.08 (0.92,1.28), P= 0.35)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that PR and QTc intervals, age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo>, and ST-T abnormalities were related to development of AF after adjustment for many variables including alcohol consumption, which itself was univariately predictive of developing AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> on the ECG was not a risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> was strongly linked with developing AF but not <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pravastatin does not reduce the incidence of AF in older people at risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, at least in the short-medium term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for AF include older age, prolongation of PR or QTc intervals, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo>, and ST-T abnormalities on the ECG </plain></SENT>
