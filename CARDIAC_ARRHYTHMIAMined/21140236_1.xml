<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The calcium-tolerant Sprague-Dawley rat ventricular myocytes were isolated by enzyme digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">docosahexaenoic acid</z:chebi> (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (<z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi>) on action potentials and transient outward <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> currents (I (to)) of epicardial ventricular myocytes were investigated using whole-cell patch clamp techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Action potential durations (APDs) and I (to) were observed in different concentrations of DHA and <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>APD(25), APD(50), and APD(90) with 0.1 μmol/L DHA and <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> were prolonged less than 15% and 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, APDs were prolonged in concentration-dependent manners when DHA and <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> were more than 1 μmol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>APD(25), APD(50), and APD(90) were 7.7 ± 2.0, 21.2 ± 3.5, and 100.1 ± 9.8 ms respectively with 10 μmol/L DHA, and 7.2 ± 2.5, 12.8 ± 4.2, and 70.5 ± 10.7 ms respectively with 10 μmol/L <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>I (to) currents were gradually reduced with the increased concentrations of DHA and <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> from 1 to 100 μmol/L, and their half-inhibited concentrations were 2.3 ± 0.2 and 3.8 ± 0.6 μmol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results showed APDs were prolonged and I (to) current densities were gradually reduced with the increased concentrations of DHA and <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> mechanisms of n-3 PUFA are complex, however, the effects of n-3 PUFA on action potentials and I (to) may be one of the important mechanisms </plain></SENT>
