<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was treated by angioplasty with drug-eluting stents to avoid restenosis by bare-metal stent implantation in small diameter <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> as already described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After predilatation, two 4 × 32-mm and a 3 × 20-mm Taxus® Liberté stents (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) were deployed across upper and lower LSPV branches and the ostio-antral segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two month follow-up CT angiography showed patent stents in the LSPV, without in-stent restenosis (no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002105'>hemoptysis</z:hpo> at 24-month follow-up) </plain></SENT>
