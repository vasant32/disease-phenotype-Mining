<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether AZD1305 was effective in converting AF to sinus rhythm (SR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with AF episodes of duration 3 h to 3 months were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive a maximum 30 min intravenous infusion of AZD1305 or matching placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients converting within 90 min of the start of infusion, after which patients who had not converted were to undergo direct current (DC) cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four ascending AZD1305 dose groups were assigned sequentially, with dose rates of 50, 100, 130, and 180 mg/h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 171 patients were randomized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological conversion was achieved in 0 of 43 patients (0%) in the placebo group, and in 2 of 26 (8%; P= 0.14 vs. placebo), 8 of 45 (18%; P= 0.006), 17 of 45 (38%; P&lt; 0.001), and 6 of 12 patients (50%; P&lt; 0.001) in AZD1305 dose groups 1-4, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Maximum QTcF (QT interval corrected according to Fridericia's formula) generally increased dose-dependently up to a plateau, although there was wide variation between patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsade de pointes</z:hpo> (TdP): one patient without symptoms in dose group 3, and one patient requiring DC defibrillation in dose group 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both patients recovered without sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AZD1305 was effective in converting AF to SR, but was associated with QT prolongation and TdP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The benefit-risk profile was judged as unfavourable and the AZD1305 development programme was discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clinical trial registration: http://clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00915356 </plain></SENT>
