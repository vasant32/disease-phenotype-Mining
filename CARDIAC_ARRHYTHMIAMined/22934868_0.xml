<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to document the effectiveness of TH when it is used at the discretion of treating physicians and not under the auspices of a research trial or protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective review of intensive care unit admissions over a four-year period detected 43 patients appropriate for TH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the emergency department, only 20% of patients had TH commenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-four percent of patients required angiography in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It took, on average, 595 minutes for patients to reach their goal temperature, which was not reached at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in 13% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients (44%) had a positive neurological outcome while 24 patients (56%) either died or had a poor neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Without the control of a hospital protocol it was apparent that the implementation of TH in patients with an out-of-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> in our institution was inadequate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We recommend that TH is undertaken within the framework of a protocol that encompasses <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the relevant departments </plain></SENT>
