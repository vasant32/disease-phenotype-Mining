<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our goal is to quantify LV/RV differences in action potential duration (APD) and APD rate adaptation and their contribution to arrhythmogenic substrates in the in vivo human heart using combined in vivo and in silico studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Electrograms were acquired from 10 LV and 10 RV endocardial sites in 15 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>APD and APD adaptation were measured during an increase in heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of in vivo electrograms revealed longer APD in LV than RV (207.8 ± 21.5 vs 196.7 ± 20.1 ms; P&lt;0.05), and slower APD adaptation in LV than RV (time constant τ(s) =47.0 ± 14.3 vs 35.6 ± 6.5 s; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following rate acceleration, LV/RV APD dispersion experienced an increase of up to 91% in 12 patients, showing a strong correlation (r(2) =0.90) with both initial dispersion and LV/RV difference in slow adaptation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pro-arrhythmic implications of measured LV/RV functional differences were studied using in silico simulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results show that LV/RV APD and APD adaptation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneities</z:hpo> promote unidirectional block following rate acceleration, albeit being insufficient for establishment of reentry in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in the presence of an ischemic region at the LV/RV junction, LV/RV <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in APD and APD rate adaptation promotes reentrant activity and its degeneration into fibrillatory activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that LV/RV <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneities</z:hpo> in APD adaptation cause a transient increase in APD dispersion in the human ventricles following rate acceleration, which promotes unidirectional block and wave-break at the LV/RV junction, and may potentiate the arrhythmogenic substrate, particularly in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
