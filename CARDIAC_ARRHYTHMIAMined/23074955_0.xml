<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Means age of patients was 34.3 +/- 16.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 22 patients were successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of additional pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RFA effectiveness was evaluated with the help of clinical questionnaire, data of ECG, EchoCG, heart rate variability (HRV), frequency response and nonlinear dynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac rhythm disturbances</z:hpo> were verified using Holter monitoring applied to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Positive clinical effect was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the WPW patients, as RFA arrested <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Holter monitoring did not register cardiac disturbances which points to high RFA effectiveness in WPW patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HRV, frequency response and nonlinear dynamics reassumed their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patterns </plain></SENT>
