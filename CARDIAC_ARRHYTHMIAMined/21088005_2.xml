<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reported restenosis rates after balloon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and bare-metal stent implantation are high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Drug-eluting stent implantation (DES) has not been reported in the setting of PVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients suspected of having PVS after PVI based on clinical symptoms and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) follow-up (FU) were referred for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> DES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One or more branches of the affected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> as documented by angiography were stented (paclitaxel or zotarolimus DES) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up consisted of repeat <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> angiography and TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over a period of 2 years, five patients were treated with a total of eight DES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A paclitaxel DES was used in seven of eight implants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean FU was 12 ± 14 months during which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients remained asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiography Doppler maximal flow velocity (V(max)) of the affected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> rose from 58 ± 6 cm/s pre-PVI to 207 ± 20 cm/s pre-DES (+358%, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After DES, V(max) decreased acutely with 86 ± 15 cm/s (-58%, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During FU, V(max) remained stable in three patients and increased moderately in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Angiography at 3 months confirmed absence of restenosis in the first three patients and moderate (40%) restenosis in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In one patient, an increase of V(max) back to pre-DES values correlated with a 65% peri-stent stenosis, treated with a redo DES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In total, after seven primary DES only one (asymptomatic) proximal margin restenosis required re-stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Initial experience with DES for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> stenosis suggests an excellent stent patency rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiography Doppler measurements provide a viable way of monitoring stent patency </plain></SENT>
