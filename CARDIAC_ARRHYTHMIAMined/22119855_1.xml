<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Conduction disorders</z:e> and permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation are common complications in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies, evaluating small populations, have identified several different predictors of PPM implantation after TAVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the incidence rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conduction disorders</z:e> and the predictors of postoperative PPM requirement in a large series of patients undergoing TAVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were analyzed from 181 consecutive patients at high-risk surgery who underwent TAVI at our institute between July 2007 and April 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent implantation of the third-generation percutaneous self-expanding CoreValveÂ® prosthesis (CoreValve, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, a 12-lead electrocardiogram and a 24-h holter monitoring was recorded before and after the procedure in order to assess the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conduction disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical data, preoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conduction disorders</z:e>, echocardiographic patterns, and procedural data were tested as predictors of PPM implantation after TAVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>Left bundle branch block</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e>) was the most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conduction disorder</z:e>, with an incidence of 50.3% at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two (32.1%) patients developed a persistent complete AVB requiring PPM implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PPM implantation was strongly correlated with the presence of preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011712'>right bundle branch block</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RBBB</z:e>) which was found to be the only independent predictor of PPM implantation (HR 16.5, CI 3.3-82.3, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> and PPM implantation requirement after TAVI are common occurrences using the self-expanding CoreValve prosthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this large series of consecutive patients, only <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RBBB</z:e> was found to be a strong predictor of PPM requirement </plain></SENT>
