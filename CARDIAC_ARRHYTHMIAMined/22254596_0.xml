<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although its mechanisms are incompletely understood, electrophysiological and structural remodeling of the atria seem to play an important role in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> transition from paroxysmal to persistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the time course of the atrial remodeling along onward episodes of non-induced paroxysmal AF has not been investigated yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this work, a non-invasive method, based on the regularity estimation of AF through sample entropy (SampEn), has been used to assess the organization evolution along onward episodes of paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Given that AF organization has been associated to the number of existing wavelets wandering throughout the atrial tissue, SampEn could be considered as a concomitant estimator of atrial remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The achieved results, in close agreement with previous findings obtained from invasive recordings, showed a progressive disorganization increase along onward episodes of AF for 63% of the analyzed patients and a stable AF organization degree in the remaining 37% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a positive correlation between episode duration and SampEn was also noticed (R = 0.541, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, it could be considered that atrial electrophysiological dynamics that occur along onward paroxysmal AF episodes are reflected and can be quantified from ECG recordings through non-invasive organization estimation </plain></SENT>
