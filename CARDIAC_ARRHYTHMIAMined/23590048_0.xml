<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify the predictive factors, incidence, and prognosis of tachyarrhythmia and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bradyarrhythmia</z:e> in non-coronary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> medical patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: A single center prospective cohort study, included medical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> patients, age &gt; or = 18 year-old, admitted in a 15-bed medical ICU between September 2010 and August 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, end stage organ failure and not expected to survive &gt; or = 48 hours were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients' baseline characteristic, APACHE II score, laboratory investigations in the first 24 hours and treatment modalities were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Continuous electrocardiographic monitoring was performed during ICU admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The arrhythmic event, requiring treatment, was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 247 patients were included, the mean age was 58.5 +/- 20.0 year-old and mean APACHE II score was 20.1 +/- 9.8 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of these, junctional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> was witnessed in 34 patients (13.8%), followed by symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> (15 patients, 6.1%) and atrioventricular blockage (4 patients, 1.60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The multivariate by logistic regression analysis revealed the receiving of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> and APACHE II &gt; or = 25 as an independent predictor for tachyarrhythmia, while the receiving of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>, arterial pH &lt; 7.3 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17544">HCO3 </z:chebi>&gt; or = 18 were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bradyarrhythmia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
