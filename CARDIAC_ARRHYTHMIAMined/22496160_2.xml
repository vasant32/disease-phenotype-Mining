<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>Sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> and life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> remain a concern in adult patients with repaired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal left ventricular (LV) function is sensitive in detecting early myocardial damage and may have prognostic implications in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 413 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> patients (age, 36 ± 13 years; QRS duration, 148 ± 27 milliseconds; LV ejection fraction, 55 ± 10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A composite end point of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo>/life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> (sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, resuscitated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo>, or appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator discharge) was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 2.9 years, 5 patients died suddenly, 9 had documented sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, and another 5 had appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On univariate Cox analysis, QRS duration (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02 per 1 ms; P=0.046), right atrial area (HR, 1.05 per 1 cm(2); P=0.02), right ventricular fractional area change (HR, 0.94 per 1%; P=0.02), right ventricular outflow tract diameter (HR, 1.08 per 1 mm; P=0.01), mitral annular plane systolic excursion (HR, 0.84 per 1 mm; P=0.03), and LV global longitudinal 2-dimensional strain (HR, 0.87 per 1%; P=0.03) were related to the combined end point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On bivariable analysis, mitral annular plane systolic excursion and LV global longitudinal 2-dimensional strain were related to outcome independently of QRS duration (P=0.002 and P=0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, a combination of echocardiographic variables, including right atrial area, right ventricular fractional area change, and LV global longitudinal 2-dimensional strain or mitral annular plane systolic excursion, was also found to be significantly related to outcome (P&lt;0.001; c statistic, 0.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LV longitudinal dysfunction was associated with greater risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo>/life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In combination with echocardiographic right heart variables, also available from routine echocardiography, these measures provide important outcome information and should be considered a useful adjunct to established markers such as QRS duration in the estimation of prognosis in this challenging population </plain></SENT>
