<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, investigators demonstrated associations between fine particulate matter (PM)-associated metals and adverse health effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Residual oil fly ash (ROFA), a waste product of <z:chebi fb="212" ids="35230">fossil fuel</z:chebi> combustion from boilers, is rich in the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="27081">transition metals</z:chebi> Fe, Ni, and V, and when released as a fugitive particle, is an important contributor to ambient fine particulate air pollution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that a single-inhalation exposure to transition metal-rich PM will cause concentration-dependent cardiovascular toxicity in spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats implanted with telemeters to monitor heart rate and electrocardiogram were exposed once by nose-only inhalation for 4 hours to 3.5 mg/m(3), 1.0 mg/m(3), or 0.45 mg/m(3) of a synthetic PM (dried salt solution), similar in composition to a well-studied ROFA sample consisting of Fe, Ni, and V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exposure to the highest concentration of PM decreased T-wave amplitude and area, caused ST <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005333'>reduced heart rate</z:mp> (HR), and increased nonconducted P-wave <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These changes were accompanied by increased <z:mp ids='MP_0001861'>pulmonary inflammation</z:mp>, lung resistance, and vagal tone, as indicated by changes in markers of HR variability (increased root of the mean of squared differences of adjacent RR intervals [RMSSD], low frequency [LF], high frequency <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29228">[HF]</z:chebi>, and decreased LF/HF), and attenuated myocardial micro-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> segments that suppress translation by targeting <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi>) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The low and intermediate concentrations of PM had less effect on the inflammatory, HR variability, and micro-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> endpoints, but still caused significant reductions in HR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the intermediate concentration caused ST <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and increased QRS area, whereas the low concentration increased the T-wave parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, PM-induced cardiac dysfunction is mediated by multiple mechanisms that may be dependent on PM concentration and myocardial vulnerability (this abstract does not reflect the policy of the United States Environmental Protection Agency) </plain></SENT>
