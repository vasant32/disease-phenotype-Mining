<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Patients undergoing cardiac surgery with a history of untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> have reduced survival compared with similar patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to compare the midterm survival of patients who received concomitant surgical ablation treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> ablated) with that of matched patients without a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (no <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated 3262 consecutive patients (813 [25%] with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and 2449 [75%] without preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>) undergoing cardiac surgery at a single institution from April 2004 to April 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, 565 (70%) were treated with a concomitant surgical ablation procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Propensity scores were calculated on the basis of 37 known preoperative risk factors and yielded 744 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Midterm survival was compared between patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> ablation (n = 372) and patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (n = 372) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival was also compared between patients with successful vs unsuccessful ablation, and a matched analysis was performed at 1 year between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 2.7 Â± 1.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and patients with treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> had similar early 30-day mortality (1.2% vs 0.3%, P = .37) and overall mortality rates (11.6% vs 9.4%, P = .344), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Survival analysis showed no differences at 1, 3, and 5 years between the 2 groups (log-rank P = .22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At last follow-up, 78% of treated patients were free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At 1 year, 68% of patients were free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and antiarrhythmic medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and antiarrhythmic medication at 1 year predicted improved midterm survival (P = .03) compared with patients in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> or taking antiarrhythmic medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Propensity-matched analysis after 1 year demonstrated improved survival for patients who were successfully treated (P = .016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing surgical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> had survival similar to that of patients without a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Those with successful sinus restoration had improved survival compared with those who were treated but remained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
