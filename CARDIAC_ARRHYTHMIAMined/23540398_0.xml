<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> (AT) are a common complication after surgical closure of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From a prospective ablation database we analyzed data of patients with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> repair who presented to our institution for AT ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated ECG characteristics and the electrophysiologic mechanism of AT in this collective and analyzed follow-up data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data of 54 patients (47.3±14.5years, 35 females) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 30 patients (55.6%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> had been closed by direct suture, 24 patients (44.4%) had a patch for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> repair without significant difference in terms of gender and age at the time of the procedure (p=0.234, p=0.231) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 42 patients (77.8%), electrophysiological studies were performed in AT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had right atrial macro-reentrant AT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The leading mechanism was isthmus-dependent right <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> in 29 patients (69.0%) with clockwise atrial activation in 41% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of AT (typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (n=29), atriotomy-dependent flutter (n=7), and double loop flutter (n=5)) did not differ with regard to type of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only 70.6% of patients with proven isthmus dependent counter-clockwise <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> presented with an ECG <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> typical for this mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clockwise typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> patients showed the characteristic positive P-waves in the inferior leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of note, 83.3% of clockwise typical flutter ECGs had long isoelectric lines (mean 74.5 ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was complete in 45 of 54 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 7.7±3.7years, 27 patients (60%) remained free of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, two patients had AT recurrence with different mechanisms compared to the first procedure and underwent successful ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Five patients (11%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Isthmus dependent right <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> is the leading AT mechanism in patients with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> did not differ in relation to the mode of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> closure (direct suture versus patch closure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>ECG characteristics of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> may be misleading as they are more often atypical in patients after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> repair </plain></SENT>
