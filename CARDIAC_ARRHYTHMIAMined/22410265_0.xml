<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We questioned whether pre-test respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA; an index of phasic vagal cardiac control) and/or rate pressure product (RPP; a measure of cardiac workload) were associated with error rate and/or error-related electrocortical responses (ERPs) during a Go/NoGo inhibitory control task across three levels of working memory load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ERPs, RSA and RPP were indirectly associated with performance in young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within the older group, higher resting RPP was directly associated with NoGo errors at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> levels of load, an association not seen in the younger group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, for older adults, excessive hemodynamic demands at rest were more relevant than on-task electrocortical responses in the prediction of inhibitory control errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data support the relevance of autonomic regulation in understanding age-related change in higher-order neurocognitive function </plain></SENT>
