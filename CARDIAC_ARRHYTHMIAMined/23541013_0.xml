<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is a significant risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and peripheral embolization, and it has an effect on cardiac function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite widespread interest and extensive research on this topic, our understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of this disease process is still incomplete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a result, there are no set primary preventive strategies in place apart from general cardiology risk factor prevention goals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It seems intuitive that a better understanding of the risk factors for AF would better prepare medical professionals to initially prevent or subsequently treat these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this article, we discuss widely established risk factors for AF and explore newer risk factors currently being investigated that may have implications in the primary prevention of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For this review, we conducted a search of PubMed and used the following search terms (or a combination of terms): <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="25681">omega-3 fatty acids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>, exercise toxicity, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085762" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="aca">alcohol abuse</z:e>, and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also used additional articles that were identified from the bibliographies of the retrieved articles to examine the published evidence for the risk factors of AF </plain></SENT>
