<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in some patients, the LVEF does not return to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 6 months postoperatively, despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> preoperative diameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, our study aimed to evaluate whether preoperative LV strain values assessed by echocardiography at rest and during exercise were predictors of postoperative LVEF at 6-month follow-up in patients undergoing surgery for severe organic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In total, 88 patients with severe organic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> (mean age 62.6 ± 1.4 years) were prospectively recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent an echocardiogram at rest and submaximal exercise (110 ± 10 bpm) prior to surgery and then at rest 6 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria were significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, other organic valvular diseases, uncontrolled <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haemodynamic instability</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 88 patients, 77 had complete data sets with rest and exercise echocardiograms and underwent isolated mitral valve surgery (repaired, n= 72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Global longitudinal strain (GLS) at rest (R= -0.42, P= 0.011) and during exercise (R= -0.36, P= 0.034) correlated with postoperative LVEF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When normalized for LV end-systolic diameter, GLS during exercise was more closely correlated with postoperative LVEF and was its best predictor based on a multivariate linear regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At a cut-off of -5.7%/cm, sensitivity was 0.83, specificity 0.70, negative predictive value 0.64, and positive predictive value 0.86 for predicting a 6-month postoperative LVEF of &lt;50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing surgery for severe organic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>, GLS normalized for LV end-systolic diameter at submaximal exercise may be used as a predictor of postoperative LVEF </plain></SENT>
