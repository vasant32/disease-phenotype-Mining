<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study sought to investigate the characteristics of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> among biatrial orthotopic HT patients during long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included 217 patients who received biatrial orthotopic HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified into 5 groups according to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> episodes that occurred &gt;1 month after HT: no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (group 1; n = 149); atrial tachyarrhythmias only (group 2; n = 34); ventricular tachyarrhythmias only (group 3; n = 9); <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bradyarrhythmias</z:e> only (group 4; n = 7); or double/triple <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (group 5; n = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed their long-term outcomes respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 83 Â± 51 months of follow-up, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality rates were higher in groups 3 (88.9%) and 5 (72.2%) compared with the other groups (groups 1, 2, and 4: 21.5%, 41.2%, and 57.1%, respectively; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular mortality rates were higher in groups 4 (42.9%) and 5 (61.1%) compared with the other groups (groups 1, 2, and 3: 8.1%, 20.6%, and 0% respectively; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Noncardiovascular mortality rate was greater in group 3 (88.9%) compared with the other groups (groups 1, 2, 4, and 5: 13.4%, 20.6%, 14.3%, and 11.1%, respectively; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>Sudden death</z:hpo> rates were higher in groups 4 (42.9%) and 5 (44.4%) compared with the other groups (groups 1, 2, and 3: 7.4%, 8.8%, and 0%, respectively; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with posttransplantation <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> experienced significantly worse clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
