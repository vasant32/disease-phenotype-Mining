<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined risk factors for new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) following oesophagectomy in an attempt to guide prophylactic use of anti-arrhythmic strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were extracted from a database of patients who underwent oesophagectomy between 1991 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with pre-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were excluded leaving 997 patients for further analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors predicting AF, and receiver operating characteristic curves were generated from a model using these predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical significance was reflected in a P-value of &lt;0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients who developed AF (n = 209; 20.96%) were older (median age 70.54 years vs. 66.9 years; P &lt; 0.01) and included 141 males (67.4%) (P = 0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with AF were noted to have a higher in-hospital mortality rate (n = 17; 8.1% vs. n = 34; 4.8%) (P = 0.04) and a longer stay in hospital (14 days vs. 12 days; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified advanced age and neo-adjuvant chemotherapy to be independent predictors of the risk of developing AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Assessment of discriminative ability of a predictive model revealed a c-statistic of just 0.62 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite the identification of age and neo-adjuvant chemotherapy as predictors of AF, the moderate discriminative ability of predictive modelling does not support the use of prophylactic anti-arrhythmic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the high incidence of AF after major thoracic surgery makes it necessary to understand its underlying mechanisms better before prophylactic strategies are considered </plain></SENT>
