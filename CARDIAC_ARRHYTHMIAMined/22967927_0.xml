<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One hundred and twenty-four calves with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neonatal diarrhoea</z:e> were investigated in order to assess the prevalence of hyperkalaemia and the associated clinical signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hyperkalaemia (<z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> concentration &gt;5.8mmol/L) was recognized in 42 (34%) calves and was more closely associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo> than with decreases in base excess or venous blood pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 75 calves with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16004">D-lactate</z:chebi> (i.e. ⩽3.96mmol/L), K concentrations were moderately correlated with base excess values (r=-0.48, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no significant correlation was observed in 49 calves with elevated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16004">D-lactate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only three hyperkalaemic calves had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> and a weak positive correlation was found between heart rate and K concentrations (r=0.22, P=0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten of the 124 calves had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> and of these seven had hyperkalaemia indicating that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> had a low sensitivity (17%) but a high specificity (96%) as a predictor of hyperkalaemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a subset of 34 calves with base excess values ⩽-5mmol/L and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16004">D-lactate</z:chebi> concentrations &lt;5mmol/L (of which 22 had hyperkalaemia), changes in posture/ability to stand could be mainly explained by elevations of K concentrations (P&lt;0.001) and to a lesser extent by increases in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16651">L-lactate</z:chebi> concentrations (P=0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Skeletal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> due to hyperkalaemia alongside hypovolaemia may produce a clinical picture that is similar to that in calves with marked D-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003128'>lactic acidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, since reductions in the strength of the palpebral reflex are closely correlated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16004">D-lactate</z:chebi> concentrations, a prompt palpebral reflex can assist the clinical prediction of hyperkalaemia in calves presenting with a distinct impairment in their ability to stand (specificity 99%, sensitivity 29%) </plain></SENT>
