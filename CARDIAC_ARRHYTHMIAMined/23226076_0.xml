<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ARVC) is a rare but important cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) in the evaluation of patients with suspected ARVC referred by a general cardiology service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-two patients (mean age 48 ± 15, 49% female), referred for CMR assessment of possible ARVC, were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CMR included both functional and tissue characteristic imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No patients had ARVC based on the 1994 Task Force Criteria (TFC) prior to CMR, but 4 met proposed Modified TFC; 15% met one major (±1 minor) TFC, 71% 1 or 2 minor TFC, and 14% no TFC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reasons for CMR referral included symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> of likely RV origin (28%), Electrocardiogram/Holter abnormalities (28%), echocardiographic features suspicious of ARVC (19%), and family history of ARVC (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CMR findings strongly suggestive of ARVC were found in nine patients (10%), although only three were considered typical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these patients two met 1 major TFC and seven met 1 or 2 minor TFC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CMR findings included RV thinning, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, and diastolic out-pouching, but only 1 patient had definite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_591'>fatty infiltration</z:mpath> of the RV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Incidentally, CMR detected important, previously undiagnosed pathology, including anomalous pulmonary venous drainage (2 patients) and non-ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CMR was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 63%, with minor abnormalities in 29% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CMR may play an important diagnostic role in the evaluation of possible ARVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients who do not meet TFC for diagnosis may have CMR features typical of ARVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Additionally CMR may detect other hitherto undiagnosed structural or functional abnormalities that alter patient management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However the majority of patients referred have a low pretest probability of ARVC, and the rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CMR scans is high </plain></SENT>
