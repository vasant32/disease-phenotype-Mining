<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prevalence is highly related to age, with every fourth individual older than 40 years old developing AF during his lifetime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Due to an aging population, the prevalence of AF is estimated to at least double within the next 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This article presents AF-related cost-of-illness studies and reviews 19 cost-effectiveness studies and six cost studies published roughly over the past decade, which have compared different antiarrhythmic medications for AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A systematic literature search for studies published between June 2000 and December 2011 was conducted in PubMed using the combination of keywords ((<z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> OR <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo>) AND cost) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Current cost-effectiveness analyses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> and the pill-in-the-pocket strategy are subject to substantial uncertainties with regard to clinical benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparing rate control with rhythm control, a cost-effectiveness advantage for rate control was shown in several but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within antiarrhythmic drug treatments, <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> added onto ibutilide was shown to be more cost effective than ibutilide alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparing chemical and electrical cardioversion, the latter was recommended as more cost effective from the healthcare system perspective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> reviewed studies but one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Catheter ablation appeared more cost effective than antiarrhythmic drugs in the medium to long run after 3.2-63.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Admissions to hospital, inpatient care and interventional procedures as well as mortality benefit are key drivers for the cost effectiveness of AF medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No clear cost-effectiveness advantage emerged for one specific antiarrhythmic drug from the studies that compared antiarrhythmic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Rate control as well as catheter ablation appear more cost effective than rhythm control in the treatment of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Rate control treatment also seems more cost effective than electrical cardioversion in AF patients </plain></SENT>
