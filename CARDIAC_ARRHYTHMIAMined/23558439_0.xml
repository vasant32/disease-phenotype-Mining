<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cardiac intercalated disc harbors mechanical and electrical junctions as well as ion channel complexes mediating propagation of electrical impulses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiac connexin43 (Cx43) co-localizes and interacts with several of the proteins located at intercalated discs in the ventricular myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have generated conditional Cx43D378stop mice lacking the last five C-terminal amino acid residues, representing a binding motif for zonula occludens protein-1 (ZO-1), and investigated the functional consequences of this mutation on cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Newborn and adult homozygous Cx43D378stop mice displayed markedly impaired and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> cardiac electrical activation properties and died from severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cx43 and ZO-1 were co-localized at intercalated discs in Cx43D378stop hearts, and the Cx43D378stop gap junction channels showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> coupling properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patch clamp analyses of isolated adult Cx43D378stop cardiomyocytes revealed a significant decrease in <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current densities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we also observed a significant loss of Nav1.5 protein from intercalated discs in Cx43D378stop hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The phenotypic <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> of the Cx43D378stop mutation was very similar to the one previously reported for adult Cx43 deficient (Cx43KO) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Yet, in contrast to Cx43KO mice, the Cx43 gap junction channel was still functional in the Cx43D378stop mutant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> of Cx43D378stop mice is independent of the loss of gap junctional intercellular communication, but most likely results from impaired cardiac <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> currents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Cx43D378stop mice reveal for the first time that Cx43 dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> can develop by mechanisms other than impairment of gap junction channel function </plain></SENT>
