<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>Hypertrophy</z:mpath> has been shown to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> which can be caused by abnormal remodeling of the Kv4-family of transient <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15346">coenzyme A</z:chebi> reductase (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>) have recently been shown to exert pleiotropic protective effects in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e>, including anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is hypothesized that remodeling of Kv4.3 occurs in rat hypertrophied cardiomyocytes and is regulated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats and neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) underwent abdominal aortic banding (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AAB</z:chebi>) for 7 weeks and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">AngII</z:chebi>) treatment, respectively, to induce <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Kv4.3 expression by NRVMs and myocardium (subepicardial and subendocardial) in the left ventricle was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The transient outward <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current (I(to)) of NRVMs was recorded using a whole-cell patch-clamp method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Expression of the Kv4.3 transcript and protein was significantly reduced in myocardium (subepicardial and subendocardial) in the left ventricle and in NRVMs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> partially prevented the reduction of Kv4.3 expression in NRVMs and subepicardial myocardium but not in the subendocardial myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hypertrophied NRVMs exhibited a significant reduction in the I(to) current and this effect was partially reversed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> alleviated the reduction of Kv4.3 expression, I(to) currents in hypertrophied NRVMs and alleviated the reduced Kv4.3 expression in subepicardial myocardium from the hypertrophied left ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It can be speculated that among the pleiotropic effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi>, the anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> effect is partly mediated by its effect on Kv4.3 </plain></SENT>
