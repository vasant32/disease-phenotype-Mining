<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Auscultatory measurement using a sphygmomanometer has been the predominant method for clinical estimation of blood pressure, but it is now rapidly being replaced by oscillometric measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare blood pressure by auscultatory and oscillometric measurements in patients ≥ 80 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: 100 patients had blood pressure measured by auscultation with a sphygmomanometer and by an electronic device using the oscillometric method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For each patient the mean of two blood pressures with each method measured within 15 min were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 85.8 years; 55.8% were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The correlation coefficient for systolic blood pressure was 0.88 and for diastolic 0.79 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differences between auscultatory and oscillometric values were less than 10 mmHg in 70.6% of systolic blood pressures and in 83.2% for diastolic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> did not influence the results, and there was no correlation between the magnitude of the differences and the level of blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Agreement between oscillometric and auscultatory measurements of blood pressure in octogenarians was found to be less than required by validation protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, semi-automatic equipment, which is observer-independent, may be used even in the very elderly, particularly if multiple readings are performed </plain></SENT>
