<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to establish baseline data and develop a tool to allow for systematic evaluation of pediatric cardiac surgical complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a first step, we examined the incidence and distribution of complications, risk stratified by case complexity in a single institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With improving mortality rates for congenital heart surgery, the next frontier for improving patient outcomes is characterizing and reducing complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Currently, no standardized approach is available to monitor the incidence and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> complications associated with a congenital cardiac surgery program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Complications occurring in pediatric cardiac surgical patients (January 2006 to March 2009) were collected by database review applying standardized definitions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The surgical procedures were stratified by complexity to analyze the distribution of complications over the risk spectrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each complication was assigned a severity coefficient (1-3) used to calculate the combined effect of frequency and severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cumulative sum method was used to determined the trend of the adverse outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 292 procedures, 84 (28.8%) were associated with a total of 150 complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 150 complications, 37 occurred in patients who died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common complications were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (14.5%), cardiac (12.6%), and operative (12.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a linear relationship between the frequency and severity of complications and surgical complexity, as stratified using the Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery category or Aristotle basic complexity levels (Spearman's coefficient = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When examined in a systematic fashion, the risk of complications in pediatric cardiac surgical patients is considerable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our data illustrate that it is possible to track complications over time in a consistent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The effect of complication monitoring on patient outcomes remains to be proved </plain></SENT>
