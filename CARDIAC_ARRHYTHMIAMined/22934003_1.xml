<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present review, we will focus on the effects of PUFAs on a cardiac <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel (Na(v)1.5) and two <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channels involved in cardiac atrial and ventricular repolarization (K(v)) (K(v)1.5 and K(v)11.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>n-3 PUFAs of marine (docosahexaenoic, DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid, <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi>) and plant origin (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27432">alpha-linolenic acid</z:chebi>, ALA) block K(v)1.5 and K(v)11.1 channels at physiological concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, DHA and <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> decrease the expression levels of K(v)1.5, whereas ALA does not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DHA and <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> also decrease the magnitude of the currents elicited by the activation of Na(v)1.5 and calcium channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These effects on <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> and calcium channels should theoretically shorten the cardiac action potential duration (APD), whereas the blocking actions of n-3 PUFAs on K(v) channels would be expected to produce a lengthening of cardiac action potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the effects of n-3 PUFAs on the cardiac APD and, therefore, on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> vary depending on the method of application, the animal model, and the underlying cardiac pathology </plain></SENT>
