<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study that included consecutive patients with AVNRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used an anatomical approach with only 2 catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Decremental AV nodal conduction and atrial-His conduction interval jump were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To detect the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the QRS, we used surface lead II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the stimulation protocol, we performed S2-QRS and S3-QRS measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An increase in the S3-QRS3 interval of 50 milliseconds or greater in response to a decrease in the S2-QRS2 coupling interval of 10 milliseconds was defined as a discontinuous AV nodal function curve and taken as evidence of dual antegrade AV pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Atrioventricular nodal reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> was demonstrated by the presence of dual AV nodal <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp>, atrial echoes, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> induction with a 1:1 AV relationship and a VA interval of less than 70 milliseconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Short RF applications (10-15 seconds) were delivered at an intermediate point between the posteroseptal and medioseptal regions of the Koch triangle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The applications were considered effective when junctional rhythm appeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The end point was the demonstration of slow pathway modification without AVNRT induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three hundred forty-four patients (age, 49.22 ± 17.47 years; 254 were female) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Discontinuous AV nodal function curves were found in 271 patients (78.77%), and short-term success was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The anterograde jump in AV nodal conduction was abolished after RF in 222 patients (81.91%), and discontinuous AV nodal conduction and single AV nodal echo beats persisted in 49 cases (18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The mean number of RF application was 7.79 ± 2.23, the mean number of effective applications was 4.63 ± 0.62, and the mean RF application time was 54.92 ± 8.03 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The total procedure and fluoroscopy time was 29.45 ± 9.6 and 10.87 ± 2.36 minutes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>After the procedure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were followed up for a mean of 46.44 ± 18.89 months, and 7 patients (2%) presented AVNRT recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Complications were observed in 4 patients (1.16%); no permanent <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study, slow pathway RF ablation using a simplified approach technique is an effective and safe approach for the treatment of AVNRT </plain></SENT>
