<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Riata and Riata ST leads (St Jude Medical, Sylmar, CA) were recalled in 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These leads are prone to externalized conductors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is electrical malfunctions that may result in serious adverse events, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> of patients with Riata and Riata ST leads that have been reported to the Food and Drug Administration to determine whether they were due to lead malfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A similar analysis was performed for Quattro Secure leads (Medtronic, Inc, Minneapolis, MN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In February 2012, we searched the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturers and User Facility Device Experience database for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> associated with Riata, Riata ST, and Quattro Secure leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A lead-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was a sudden or unexpected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> accompanied by evidence of lead malfunction; an indeterminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> that was nonsudden or evidence of lead malfunction was not provided; a not lead-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> that was nonsudden and/or there was no evidence that the lead contributed to the patient's demise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Manufacturers and User Facility Device Experience database search found 133 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>; of these, 22 were caused by Riata or Riata ST lead failure and 5 were caused by Quattro Secure lead failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Riata and Riata ST lead failure <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were typically caused by short circuits between high-voltage components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was due to externalized conductors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Riata and Riata ST implantable cardioverter-defibrillator leads are prone to high-voltage failures that have resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These failures appeared to have been caused by insulation defects that resulted in short circuiting between high-voltage components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Externalized conductors were not a factor in these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
