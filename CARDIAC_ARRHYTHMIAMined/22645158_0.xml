<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Holter examination was also performed at different time frames: an entire 24-hour period, a four-hour period during sleep, and a four-hour period while awake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten healthy (control group) and 28 MMVD dogs, 15 with and 13 without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The SDANN (sd of the mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> RR intervals for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five-minute segments during 24-hour Holter) and pNN(50) (percentage of differences between adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> RR intervals that are &gt;50 ms computed over 24-hour Holter) variables were significantly lower in the dogs with MMVD <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The differences in HRV between the groups were only detected during the 24-hour evaluation period (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were high correlations (canonical analysis) between Holter and echocardiography examinations when considering pNN(50), SDANN, and LA/AO (left atrial to aortic root ratio) (r=0.92; P&lt;0.05), indicating that both are important in evaluating MMVD dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SDANN and pNN(50) are measures of parasympathetic control of the heart, and thus, it is possible to infer that the MMVD dogs exhibit parasympathetic withdrawal during the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
