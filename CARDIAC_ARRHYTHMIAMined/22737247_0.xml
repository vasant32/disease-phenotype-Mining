<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> significantly increased the mean and maximum lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster (Drosophila) and enhanced cardiac function in aging flies by significantly reducing heart <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and increasing the contraction proportion of the contraction/relaxation cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These results appeared independent of internal changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16389">ubiquinone</z:chebi> or juvenile hormone levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rather, they appeared to involve decreased protein prenylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> decreased the membrane association (prenylation) of specific small Ras GTPases in mice </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data are the most direct evidence to date that decreased protein prenylation can increase cardiac health and lifespan in any metazoan species, and may explain the pleiotropic (non-cholesterol related) health effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
