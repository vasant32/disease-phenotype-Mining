<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The probable cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> is <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45652">succinylcholine</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002153'>hyperkalemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of interest, this case demonstrated in the same patient that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> only occurred during third intubation, when duration of illness is prolonged, and not during previous two intubation episodes, despite <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45652">succinylcholine</z:chebi> was also being used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In GBS, muscle denervation resulted in up-regulation of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> receptors at neuromuscular junctions, causing the muscle cell membrane to become supersensitive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45652">succinylcholine</z:chebi>, leading to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002153'>hyperkalemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45652">succinylcholine</z:chebi> was administered </plain></SENT>
