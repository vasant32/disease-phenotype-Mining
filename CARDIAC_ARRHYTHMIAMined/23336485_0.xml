<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether preoperative contrast delay-enhanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (DE-CMR) could help predict long-term survival of patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> and extremely dilated left ventricular chamber after aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Totally 37 patients enrolled between February 2008 and November 2010 with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> and extremely dilated left ventricular chamber, who met the echo criteria, that was left ventricular end diastolic dimension &gt; 70 mm or left ventricular end systolic dimension &gt; 55 mm, and were scheduled to the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 2-dimensional echocardiographic examinations and CMR with late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-enhancement (LGE) were performed routinely preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to the results of CMR, the patients were divided into 2 groups: the LGE positive(+) group and LGE negative(-) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association of LGE with event free survival, postoperative cardiac function and postoperative hospital stay time was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients had significant LGE signals in CMR films, while the other twenty-two were silent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them received the operative procedures, including aortic valve replacement in 28 cases, Bentall procedure in 3 cases, aortic valve replacement and ascending aorta replacement in 6 cases, and concomitant mitral valve repair in 11 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over a follow-up of 33.6 months, 1-year, 2-year and 3-year event free survival rates in LGE(-) group were 94.7%, 88.4%, and 72.6%, respectively, compared to 80.0%, 48.9%, and 32.6%, respectively in LGE(+) group (χ(2) = 7.244, P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The postoperative hospital stay time of LGE(-) group was (9 ± 2) days, which of LGE(+) group was (10 ± 3) days (t = 1.175, P = 0.248) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LGE positive signal in CMR films is a potential predictor of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> after aortic valve replacement for patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> and extremely dilated left ventricular chamber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It has intimate relationship with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>, which makes it a valuable technique in preoperative evaluation and risk stratification </plain></SENT>
