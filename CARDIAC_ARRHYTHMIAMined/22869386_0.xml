<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Implantation of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices is technically challenging and can be limited by lead dislodgement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Attain Starfix active fixation coronary sinus (CS) lead (model 4195, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was introduced to reduce the rate of lead dislodgement, but the active fixation mechanism presents additional difficulties should these leads require extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CS lead extraction procedures at our institution from 2003 to 2011 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Procedural variables were compared between extraction of the Starfix lead and passive fixation CS leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Attempts at reimplantation post Starfix lead extraction were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four Starfix CS leads were extracted in four patients during this time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean implant duration was 784 days (range, 392-1,029 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The indication for extraction was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean total procedure time was 141.5 min (range, 92-205 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the fixation lobes could be retracted in one lead and only the most proximal lobes could be retracted in the remaining three leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four leads were removed in their entirety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The excimer laser sheath (Spectranetics Laser Sheath II, Spectranetics Corp., Colorado Springs, CO,USA) was required to remove the lead in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 cases (100 %) compared to 25 of 131 (19.1 %) of passive fixation CS lead extractions (mean implant duration, 659 ± 697 days) performed at our institution over the same time period (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In three cases, the laser sheath had to be advanced past the CS ostium to remove the Starfix lead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>After extraction, fibrous material which had grown between the lobes of the fixation mechanism was noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Transvenous CS lead reimplantation was attempted at a median of 7.5 days post extraction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The original target branch was occluded in three patients and the main CS in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Reimplantation was successful in another branch of the CS in three of four patients; one underwent minimally invasive epicardial lead placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Starfix active fixation CS lead presents additional procedural complexity and uniform use of excimer laser sheath compared to other CS leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Reimplantation was not possible in the same venous branch in our experience </plain></SENT>
