<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Few data are available on the frequency or importance of perioperative atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> in infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> in infants undergoing cardiac surgery is not rare and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 2007 through 2010, 777 infants (median age, 1.8 months; interquartile range, 0.33-5.73) underwent cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their medical records were reviewed for atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> during the perioperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 777 patients, 64 (8.2%) developed atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The independent risk factors for developing atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> included surgical age 6 months or younger (odds ratio, 4.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-19.15), use of 3 or more inotropes (odds ratio, 2.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-6.2), and <z:mp ids='MP_0004133'>heterotaxy</z:mp> syndrome (odds ratio, 2.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-7.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>-cause mortality in the atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> group was increased (21.9% vs 7.2%, P&lt;.001) during a median follow-up period of 14.6 months (interquartile range, 6.8-24.6), and atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> was independently associated with decreased survival (hazard ratio, 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Infants with perioperative atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> had a longer hospital length of stay (32 vs 17 days, P&lt;.001) and duration of inotrope use (10.5 vs 3.0 days, P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 57 patients received antiarrhythmic therapy, with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> the most common (n=31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the survivors, 48 patients received outpatient antiarrhythmic therapy, which was successfully discontinued in 23 patients at a median duration of 14 months (interquartile range, 5.7-18.6) without recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> is common in infants undergoing cardiac surgery and is independently associated with decreased survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among survivors, antiarrhythmic agents successfully controlled atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> in most patients with a low recurrence risk after discontinuation </plain></SENT>
