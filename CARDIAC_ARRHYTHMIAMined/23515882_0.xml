<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Congenital forms of LQTS arise due to rare and highly penetrant mutations that segregate in a Mendelian fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over the years, multiple mutations in genes encoding ion channels and ion channel binding proteins have been reported to underlie congenital LQTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Drugs are by far the most common cause of acquired forms of LQTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Emerging evidence suggests that drug-induced LQTS also has a significant heritable component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the genetic substrate underlying drug-induced LQTS is presently largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In recent years, advances in next-generation sequencing technology and molecular biology techniques have significantly enhanced our ability to identify genetic variants underlying both monogenic diseases and more complex traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this review, we discuss the genetic basis of congenital and drug-induced LQTS and focus on future avenues of research in the field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ultimately, a detailed characterization of the genetic substrate underlying congenital and drug-induced LQTS will enhance risk stratification and potentially result in the development of tailored genotype-based therapies </plain></SENT>
