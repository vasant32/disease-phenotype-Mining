<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Predictable progression to battery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> is necessary for device management in patients with pacemakers or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, particularly in patients who either are pacemaker dependent or have required implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence and characteristics of unexpected battery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> in patients implanted with a cardiac resynchronization therapy - defibrillator (CRT-D) device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with a St Jude Atlas+ HF or Atlas II HF CRT-D device implanted between 2004 and 2007 at the Massachusetts General Hospital and the Nashville VA Medical Center (Vanderbilt University) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with early generator <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> (transition of generator voltage above specified elective replacement indicator [ERI] to end of life [EOL] in less than 90 days) were evaluated further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight cases (mean age 69.6 ± 9 years) with abrupt battery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> were identified among 191 patients (4.2%) implanted with a St Jude Atlas CRT-D device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The longevity of 8 premature <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> devices was 46.4 ± 10 months (median 45 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The battery voltage in these 8 devices decreased from a mean of 2.48 ± 0.03 V (above ERI) to 2.3 ± 0.08 V (below ERI) over 33.3 ± 23 days (range 1-59 days; median 38.5 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One device reached EOL status within 1 day of having battery voltage above ERI and another device within 12 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The incidence of abrupt battery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> was 4.2% in patients implanted with a St Jude Atlas CRT-D device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No common mechanism has been identified for this failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Close monitoring of battery voltage and timely generator replacement are required in patients with these devices </plain></SENT>
