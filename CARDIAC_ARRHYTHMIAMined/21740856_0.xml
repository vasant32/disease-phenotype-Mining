<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While serious side effects are rare, transient cardiac dysrhythmias (CD) may be associated with ESWL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The exact etiology of these events, which are often unpredictable, is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Awareness of CD during ESWL and identification of risk factors for developing them could help clinicians predict and manage them safely and effectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The current study examines selected variables to determine whether they may predispose individuals to developing CD during ESWL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared 16 patients who experienced CD during ESWL to 56 control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cases and controls were compared with respect to several continuous and discrete variables, including age, pre-treatment heart rate, number of shocks received during treatment, energy setting of the lithotripter, gender, presence of a ureteric stent, previous ESWL and side being treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cardiac dysrhythmias occurred more frequently in younger patients and in those being treated for right-sided stones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The other variables did not influence the likelihood of CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> CD resolved promptly following conversion to electrocardiogram (ECG)-gating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Younger age and right-sided treatment predisposed individuals to developing CD during ESWL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Careful ECG monitoring should be performed during treatment </plain></SENT>
