<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that a small molecule that diminishes I(Kr) block by a known hERG <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> would constitute a first step toward preventing hERG-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and facilitating drug discovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a high-throughput assay, we screened a library of compounds for agents that increase the IC(70) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi>, a well characterized hERG blocker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One compound, VU0405601, with the desired activity was further characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In isolated, Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts, optical mapping revealed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were reduced after pretreatment with VU0405601 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patch clamp analysis in stable hERG-HEK cells showed effects on current amplitude, inactivation, and deactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VU0405601 increased the IC(50) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> from 38.7 to 76.3 nM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>VU0405601 mitigates the effects of hERG blockers from the extracellular aspect primarily by reducing inactivation, whereas most clinically relevant hERG inhibitors act at an inner pore site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Structure-activity relationships surrounding VU0405601 identified a 3-pyridiyl and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36624">naphthyridine</z:chebi> ring system as key structural components important for preventing hERG inhibition by multiple inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that small molecules can be designed to reduce the sensitivity of hERG to inhibitors </plain></SENT>
