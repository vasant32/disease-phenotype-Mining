<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Digitalis-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> accumulation results in an increase in Ca(2+)(i) via the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/Ca(2+) exchanger, leading to enhanced sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) load, responsible for the positive inotropic and toxic arrhythmogenic effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycosides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A digitalis-induced increase in Ca(2+)(i) could also activate calcium-calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII), which has been shown to have proarrhythmic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigate whether CaMKII underlies digitalis-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and the subcellular mechanisms involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In paced rat ventricular myocytes (0.5 Hz), 50 μmol/L <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi> increased contraction amplitude by 160 ± 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the absence of electric stimulation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi> promoted spontaneous contractile activity and Ca(2+) waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">Ouabain</z:chebi> activated CaMKII (p-CaMKII), which phosphorylated its downstream targets, phospholamban (PLN) (Thr17) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor (RyR) (Ser2814) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">Ouabain</z:chebi>-induced spontaneous activity was prevented by inhibiting CaMKII with 2.5 μmol/L KN93 but not by 2.5 μmol/L of the inactive analog, KN92 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained using the CaMKII inhibitor, autocamtide-2 related inhibitory <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIP</z:e>) (1 to 2.5 μmol/L), and in myocytes from transgenic mice expressing SR-targeted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIP</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consistently, CaMKII overexpression exacerbated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi>-induced spontaneous contractile activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">Ouabain</z:chebi> was associated with an increase in SR Ca(2+) content and Ca(2+) spark frequency, indicative of enhanced SR Ca(2+) leak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>KN93 suppressed the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi>-induced increase in Ca(2+) spark frequency without affecting SR Ca(2+) content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained with digoxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In vivo, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were prevented by KN93 and absent in SR-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIP</z:e> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results show for the first time that CaMKII mediates <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi>-induced arrhythmic/toxic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We suggest that CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of the RyR, resulting in Ca(2+) leak from the SR, is the underlying mechanism involved </plain></SENT>
