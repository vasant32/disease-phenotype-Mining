<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated whether acupuncture might prevent or reduce the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrences in patients with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 80 patients with persistent AF after restoring sinus rhythm with electrical cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six subjects who were already on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> treatment constituted the AMIO reference group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients were randomly allocated to receive acupuncture (ACU group, n = 17), sham acupuncture (ACU-sham group, n = 13), or neither acupuncture nor antiarrhythmic therapy (CONTROL group, n = 24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in the ACU and ACU-sham groups attended 10 acupuncture sessions on a once-a-week basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only in the former group the Neiguan, Shenmen, and Xinshu spots were punctured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During a 12-month follow-up, AF recurred in 35 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cumulative AF recurrence rates in the AMIO, ACU, ACU-sham, and CONTROL patients were 27%, 35%, 69%, and 54%, respectively (P = 0.0075, log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ejection fraction (P = 0.0005), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (0.0293), and left atrial diameter (P = 0.0361) were also significantly associated with AF recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared with AMIO group, recurrence rate was similar in ACU patients (hazard ratio: 1.15, 95% CI: 0.38-3.49; P = 0.801) but significantly higher in ACU-sham and CONTROL patients (3.77, 1.39-10; P = 0.009 and 3.15, 1.23-8.06; P = 0.017, respectively) after adjustment for ejection fraction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and left atrial diameter using Cox modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that acupuncture treatment prevents arrhythmic recurrences after cardioversion in patients with persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This minimally invasive procedure was safe and well tolerated </plain></SENT>
