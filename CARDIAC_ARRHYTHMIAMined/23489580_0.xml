<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Robust risk-adjustment algorithms are often necessary if data from clinical registries is to be used to compare rates of important clinical outcomes between participating centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although such algorithms have been successfully developed for surgical and catheter-based cardiac interventions in children, outcomes of pediatric and congenital catheter ablation have not been modeled with respect to case mix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A working group was appointed by the Pediatric and Congenital Electrophysiology Society to develop a risk-adjustment algorithm for use in conjunction with a modernized, multicenter registry database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expert consensus was used to develop relevant outcome measures, an inclusive list of possible predictors, and estimates of associated incremental risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Historical data from the Pediatric Radiofrequency Ablation Registry was reanalyzed using multivariate regression to create statistical models of ablation outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> ablation failure and serious adverse event rates were modeled as outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical modeling was performed on 4486 cases performed in 19 centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For ablation failure rate, a simple model including general category of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> mechanism and presence of structural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> accounted for âˆ¼71% of outcome variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The model was useful for identification of between-center variability in the historical data set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although expert consensus predicted the need for a more complex model, predicted univariate effects were similar to those generated by statistical modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serious adverse events were too infrequent to permit statistical association with any predictive variable, but could be compared with the mean rate observed among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A substantial component of the intercenter variability of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ablation outcomes in a historical database of pediatric and congenital ablation patients may be accounted for by a simple statistical model, exposing variations in outcome specific to centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This will be a useful initial model for use a modern registry for pediatric catheter ablation outcomes </plain></SENT>
