<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Prior studies suggest that most <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are related to procedural complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mortality associated with PCI has steadily declined during the past decade, and the cause and circumstance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> among patients undergoing PCI in the contemporary era remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing PCI at the University of Michigan from 2001 to 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 85 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> among a total of 5520 patients undergoing PCI during this time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By using a standardized data collection form, 3 cardiologists (2 interventional, H.S.G. and D.S.M.; 1 noninvasive, A.M.B.) determined the cause and circumstance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, in addition to grading the preventability of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023212" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Left ventricular failure</z:e> was the most common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (35.3%, n=30), followed by neurological compromise (16.5%, n=14) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (12.1%, n=12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The circumstance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was mostly <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardiac (52.9%, n=45), with a procedural complication composing a small fraction (7.1%, n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reviewers determined 93% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> to be mostly or entirely unpreventable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Procedural complications are responsible for a small fraction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> among patients undergoing contemporary PCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Measures to further enhance procedural safety are unlikely to translate into meaningful reductions in PCI mortality </plain></SENT>
