<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various nonaqueous solution formulations were evaluated, in vitro, for ability to prevent or delay precipitation of Compound A from solution following dilution with water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The plasma exposures of precipitation-resistant solutions, non precipitation-resistant solutions, and aqueous suspensions were then compared in rats, dogs, and/or humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data indicated that a solubilized, precipitation-resistant formulation achieved the highest plasma concentrations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> species and also improved dose proportionality, particularly in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Development of such formulations may be highly valuable for achieving in vivo blood levels often required for successful toxicological and early clinical evaluation of poorly soluble compounds </plain></SENT>
