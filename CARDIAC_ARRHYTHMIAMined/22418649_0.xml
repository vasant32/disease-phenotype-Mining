<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four hundred seventy-four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> patients at the device follow-up clinic at Rigshospitalet using CareLink® (Medtronic) remote follow-up, who had made ≥2 transmissions, received a questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three hundred eighty-five patients (81.2%) answered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean time with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> was 56 ± 45 months and mean age was 62 ± 13 years; 80% was male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implant was: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> in 56% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in 21% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six percent had primary prophylactic indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean time on remote FU was 16.4 ± 6.9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean time spent on in-clinic FU (two-way transport and FU) was 4 h and 36 min ± 7 h and 50 min, excluding 12 patients from Greenland and Faroe Islands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ninety-five percent of the patients was very content or content with remote FU compared to in-clinic FU; 3% was less content and 2% was not content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For scheduled transmissions, 21% of the patients wished for a faster reply (sms or e-mail) compared to current practice with a letter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eighty-four percent preferred more detailed information concerning <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> leads, battery status, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A total of 96 patients (25%) had performed extra unscheduled remote transmissions: 20 due to shock, 20 due to alarm, 35 due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo>, and 18 for other or combined reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ninety-five percent of the patients were content with the remote FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Only 25% had unscheduled transmissions and most unscheduled transmissions were for appropriate reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Eighty-four percent of the patients wished for a more detailed response and 21% wished for a faster reply after routine transmissions </plain></SENT>
