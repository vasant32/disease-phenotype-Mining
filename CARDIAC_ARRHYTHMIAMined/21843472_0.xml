<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Kv7.1 (KCNQ1) channels are regulators of several physiological processes including vasodilatation, repolarization of cardiomyocytes, and control of secretory processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A number of Kv7.1 pore mutants are sensitive to extracellular <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that extracellular <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> also modulates <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> Kv7.1 channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Kv7.1 currents were measured in Xenopus laevis oocytes at different concentrations of extracellular <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> (1-50 mM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As extracellular <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> was elevated, Kv7.1 currents were reduced significantly more than expected from theoretical calculations based on the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz flux equation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">Potassium</z:chebi> inhibited the steady-state current with an IC(50) of 6.0 Â± 0.2 mM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of tail-currents showed that <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> increased the fraction of channels in the inactivated state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the recovery from inactivation was slowed by <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>, suggesting that extracellular <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> stabilizes an inactivated state in Kv7.1 channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effect of extracellular <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> was absent in noninactivating Kv7.1/KCNE1 and Kv7.1/KCNE3 channels, further supporting a stabilized inactivated state as the underlying mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, coexpression of Kv7.1 with KCNE2 did not attenuate the inhibition by <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a number of other Kv channels, including Kv1.5, Kv4.3, and Kv7.2-5 channels, currents were only minimally reduced by an increase in extracellular <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> as expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results show that extracellular <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> modulates Kv7.1 channels and suggests that physiological changes in <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> concentrations may directly control the function of Kv7.1 channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This may represent a novel regulatory mechanism of excitability and of <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> transport in tissues expressing Kv7.1 channels </plain></SENT>
