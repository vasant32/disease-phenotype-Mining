<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Prolongations of PR interval and QRS duration on 12-lead electrocardiogram are associated with atrioventricular and interventricular/intraventricular dyssynchrony, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, their clinical significance remains unclear in real-world <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed whether the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011705'>first-degree atrioventricular block</z:hpo> and/or QRS prolongation (≥120 ms) is associated with worse short- and long-term outcomes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Korean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart Failure</z:hpo> is a nationwide registry of 3,200 consecutive patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> HF at 24 centers in South Korea between June 2004 and April 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We selected 1,986 patients with sinus rhythm and divided them into 4 groups depending on the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011705'>first-degree atrioventricular block</z:hpo> and/or QRS prolongation; ED_Neither (n = 1,347), ED_PR (n = 217), ED_QRS (n = 329), and ED_Both (n = 93) groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the median follow-up of 18.2 months, overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate (17%, 22%, 20%, and 29%, P &lt; .01) tended to rise with increasing number of electrical dyssynchrony markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients in ED_Both group showed worst outcomes regarding the requirement of invasive managements during the index admission, in-hospital mortality, postdischarge <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/rehospitalization, and cardiac device implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In time-dependent Cox regression analyses, presence of both PR &gt;200 ms and QRS ≥120 ms was independently associated with in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (P &lt; .01), postdischarge <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/rehospitalization (P = .03), cardiac device implantation (P &lt; .01), and overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A combined analysis of electrical dyssynchrony markers (PR prolongation and QRS widening) might be useful for short- and long-term risk stratifications of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> HF </plain></SENT>
