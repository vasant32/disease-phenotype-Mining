<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the QT interval dispersion in 20 North Indian children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026691" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MLNS|MCLS">Kawasaki disease</z:e> (KD) with no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0158623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coronary artery abnormalities</z:e> on echocardiography compared the same with matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study population consisted of 20 children in convalescent phase of KD and 20 age and sex-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intervals were measured with the use of a digital caliper with least count of 0.01 mm by a single blinded observer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The QTc dispersion was calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum corrected QT intervals in 12 and 8 leads (i.e. the 6 precordial leads, the shortest extremity lead, and the median of the 5 other extremity leads) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 480 leads obtained (12 per subject), 36 were excluded from analysis (15 because of poor T wave formation and 11 because of presence of U waves) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Children with KD had significantly higher QTc dispersion in 12 lead (67.08 ± 17.72 ms compared to 47.63 ± 16.48 ms in controls P ≤ 0.001) as well as 8 lead (60.51 ± 18.54 ms compared to 42.92 ± 18.03 ms in controls P ≤ 0.001) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between delay in IVIG therapy and QT interval dispersion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, QT interval dispersion is significantly increased in North Indian children with KD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The dispersion is indicative of inhomogenous ventricular repolarization and may represent increased risk for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> in this population </plain></SENT>
