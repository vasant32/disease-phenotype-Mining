<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Remote monitoring systems can replace ambulatory follow-ups, sparing human and economic resources, and increasing patient safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TARIFF is a prospective, controlled, observational study aimed at measuring the direct and indirect costs and quality of life (QOL) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants by a 1-year economic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A detailed set of hospitalized and ambulatory healthcare costs and losses of productivity that could be directly influenced by the different means of follow-ups will be collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study consists of two phases, each including 100 patients, to measure the economic resources consumed during the first phase, associated with standard ambulatory follow-ups, vs. the second phase, associated with remote follow-ups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Remote monitoring systems enable caregivers to better ensure patient safety and the healthcare to limit costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TARIFF will allow defining the economic value of remote <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> follow-ups for Italian hospitals, third payers, and patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The TARIFF study, based on a cost-minimization analysis, directly comparing remote follow-up with standard ambulatory visits, will validate the cost effectiveness of the Merlin.net technology, and define a proper reimbursement schedule applicable for the Italian healthcare system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Trial registration: NCT01075516 </plain></SENT>
