<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We investigated the development of in vitro lesion formation in relation to ablation time and power delivery using 4-mm, non-irrigated, <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="12" ids="49666">iridium</z:chebi> (Pt/Ir), and gold-tip catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Radiofrequency catheter ablation was performed on porcine liver preparations in a 5-60-s time range with 5 s increments applied at different lesion sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each series was repeated four times for both catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lesion volume, the delivered energy, and the ablation power curves were analyzed in 96 ablations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The delivered energy was higher and the lesion volume was significantly larger when using a gold-tip catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lesion volume that was created with the Pt/Ir-tip electrode within 60 s was created after a shorter 40 s ablation period with the gold-tip electrode (Au, 40 s, 345 ± 75 mm(3) vs. Pt/Ir, 60 s, 328 ± 30 mm(3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The gold-tip catheters had a lower tip temperature resulting in higher energy delivery due to the better thermo-conductivity of the gold alloy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher lesion volume and a faster lesion creation were found for gold catheters as compared to Pt/Ir catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Gold-tip catheters can create the same adequate lesion within 33.3 % less ablation time due to the higher values of delivered energy as compared to those observed with the use of Pt/Ir catheters </plain></SENT>
