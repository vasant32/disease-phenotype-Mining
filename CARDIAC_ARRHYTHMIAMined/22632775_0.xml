<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary aim of this study is to determine the utility of structural analysis of the heart in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> patients who are being managed in an observation unit and have a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ECG result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a retrospective, observational chart review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive adult patients observed during 18 months at an urban, academic medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A case report form with demographics, ECG interpretations, and structural analysis of the heart data was generated and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> variables were defined before data extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects with an ECG demonstrating any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">premature atrial contraction</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>premature ventricular contraction</z:mp>, pacing, second- and third-degree blocks, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo> were excluded from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ECG group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An abnormal cardiac structure was defined as an ejection fraction less than 45%, severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, or severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular abnormality</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten percent of cases were evaluated by a second extractor to verify accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Descriptive statistics with confidence intervals (CIs) and interquartile ranges (IQRs; 25%, 75%) are used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three hundred twenty-three subjects were managed in the observation unit for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, 48% were men, and their median age was 66 years (25%, 75% IQR 52, 80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two of 323 (0.6%; 95% CI 0.2% to 2.2%) had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>; 1 of 323 had a non-ST-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (0.3%; 95% CI 0.1% to 1.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 323 patients, 267 had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ECG result and 235 (88%) had their cardiac structure evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight percent of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ECG group were men, and the median age was 65 years (25%, 75% IQR 52, 79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Zero of 235 patients (0%; 95% CI 0% to 1.6%) had a structural abnormality identified on evaluation, and 2 of 18 (11%; 95% CI 3.1% to 32.8%) had an abnormal stress echocardiogram result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Structural abnormalities are unlikely in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ECG result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Care should focus on excluding <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome </plain></SENT>
