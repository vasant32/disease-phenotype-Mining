<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> is a relatively common complication after corrective operation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unilateral stenosis of pulmonary arteries could result in decrease perfusion of affected lung, <z:mp ids='MP_0006048'>pulmonary regurgitation</z:mp>, or elevation of right ventricular pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eventually there are increasing risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001708'>right ventricular failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However we have limited data of pulmonary arterial stent in paediatric population as the treatment of branch <z:hpo ids='HP_0001642'>pulmonary stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study aimed at validating the effectiveness and investigating complications of pulmonary arterial stent implantation in a single institution during mid-term follow up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 42 patients (50 stents) were implanted for treating branch pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We used cardiac catheterization for comparing diameter after stent implantation directly and lung perfusion scan indirectly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also investigated any adverse effect relating the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Percent stenosis of stenotic lesions were decreased from 54.1±10.7% to 22.8±12.5% (p&lt;0.001) and degree of decrement in affected lung perfusion was declined from 22.7±8.0% to 10.3±9.0% (p&lt;0.001) immediately and lasts during mid-term follow up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complication rate relating the procedure was 12% (6 out of 12) and there was no mortality case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This series showed immediate and short term effectiveness of pulmonary arterial stent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart defects</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We concluded that percutaneous transcatheter implantation of pulmonary arterial stent was safe and effective during short and mid-term follow up period </plain></SENT>
