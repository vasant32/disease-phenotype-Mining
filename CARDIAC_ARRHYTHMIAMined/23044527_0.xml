<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Isolated left anterior descending (LAD) or circumflex (Cx) arteries originating from the pulmonary artery are even more rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These anomalies may cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischaemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we present the case of an 18-year-old male who survived sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> during exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified intra-myocardial blood flow from transthoracic echocardiography, and performed coronary and computed tomographic (CT) angiography, which showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the coronary arteries were ectatic and curly and there were disseminated collaterals among the coronary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We diagnosed 'anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery' (<z:mp ids='MP_0010475'>ALCAPA</z:mp>) syndrome, as additionally, the LAD originated from the pulmonary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We treated the patient with a left internal mammarian artery - left anterior descending artery (LIMA-LAD) graft </plain></SENT>
