<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The complex, polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> are, unfortunately, not yet well understood, and hence still in need of adequate therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AF contributes markedly to morbidity and mortality in aging Western populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the past decade, many genetically altered murine models have been described and characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we review genetically altered murine models of AF; powerful tools that will enable a better understanding of the mechanisms of AF and the assessment of novel therapeutic interventions </plain></SENT>
