<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to assess the incidence of unsuspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> among adults with CHD identified on electrocardiograms (ECGs) and 24-h ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring (Holter monitoring) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A review of the cardiology database at the authors' institution from July 2004 through December 2007 identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinic patients 18Â years old or older who had a recent ECG and Holter monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data collection included diagnosis, ECG and Holter monitoring results, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and the presence or absence of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The review identified 140 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the ECGs showed that 15% of the patients had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> consisted of ectopy (6%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>) (3%), pacemaker issues (2%), and previously unrecognized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> (AVB) (1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were asymptomatic (76%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the Holter monitoring results showed that 31% of the patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> consisting of ectopy (17%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> (12%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (7%), high-grade AVB (5%), and pacemaker issues (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, 80% were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> on ECG, 26% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> noted on Holter monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with multiple Holter monitorings performed, 34% had a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> noted on repeat monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were present in a significant number of adults with CHD, but the majority were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Among adults with CHD, even those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ECGs, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were frequently detected on Holter monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In addition, repeat Holter monitoring may identify significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> over time </plain></SENT>
