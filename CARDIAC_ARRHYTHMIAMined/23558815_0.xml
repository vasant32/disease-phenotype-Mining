<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>His <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and syncopal attacks were effectively abolished after the original aneurysmectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although he frequently suffered from right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, hemodialysis improved his status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the patient died due to worsening <z:hpo ids='HP_0012050'>anasarca</z:hpo> caused by RV low output syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Autopsy results indicated extensive replacement of the RV myocardium with fibrous and fatty tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This case suggests that patients with arrhythmogenic RV <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, but without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001711'>left ventricular abnormalities</z:hpo> and rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>, have a relatively favorable prognosis, although RV abnormalities may be progressive </plain></SENT>
