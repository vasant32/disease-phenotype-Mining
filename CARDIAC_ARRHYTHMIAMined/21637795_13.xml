<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cellular electrophysiology experiments, important for understanding <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> mechanisms, are usually performed with channels expressed in non myocytes, or with non-human myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Differences between cell types and species affect results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, an accurate model for the undiseased human ventricular action potential (AP) which reproduces a broad range of physiological behaviors is needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such a model requires extensive experimental data, but essential elements have been unavailable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we develop a human ventricular AP model using new undiseased human ventricular data: Ca(2+) versus voltage dependent inactivation of L-type Ca(2+) current (I(CaL)); kinetics for the transient outward, rapid delayed rectifier (I(Kr)), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/Ca(2+) exchange (I(NaCa)), and inward rectifier currents; AP recordings at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> physiological cycle lengths; and rate dependence and restitution of AP duration (APD) with and without a variety of specific channel blockers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Simulated APs reproduced the experimental AP <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, APD rate dependence, and restitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using undiseased human <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein data, models for different transmural cell types were developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Experiments for rate dependence of Ca(2+) (including peak and decay) and intracellular <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> ([<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>](i)) in undiseased human myocytes were quantitatively reproduced by the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early afterdepolarizations were induced by I(Kr) block during slow pacing, and AP and Ca(2+) alternans appeared at rates &gt;200 bpm, as observed in the nonfailing human ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK) modulated rate dependence of Ca(2+) cycling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>I(NaCa) linked Ca(2+) alternation to AP alternans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CaMK suppression or SERCA upregulation eliminated alternans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Steady state APD rate dependence was caused primarily by changes in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>](i), via its modulation of the electrogenic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> ATPase current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At fast pacing rates, late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> current and I(CaL) were also contributors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>APD shortening during restitution was primarily dependent on reduced late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> and I(CaL) currents due to inactivation at short diastolic intervals, with additional contribution from elevated I(Kr) due to incomplete deactivation </plain></SENT>
