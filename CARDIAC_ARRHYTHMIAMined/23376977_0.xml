<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: In several clinical and pre-clinical studies, application of ranolazine (RAN) led to suppression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate whether RAN can suppress AF in an experimental rabbit whole heart model, in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> haemodynamic changes trigger AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ranolazine was compared with flecainide and sotalol as established antiarrhythmic agents.METHODS AND RESULTS: In 60 Langendorff-perfused, isolated rabbit hearts, AF episodes were evoked by burst pacing with a fixed number of stimuli at baseline and following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> atrial stretch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were obtained in the absence and presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the left atrium (20 mmHg) at baseline and after drug application (RAN 10 µM, n = 10; flecainide 2 µM, n = 10; sotalol 50 µM, n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Application of sotalol, but not RAN or flecainide increased the atrial action potential duration at 90% repolarization (aAPD(90)); however, both RAN (+8 ms) and flecainide (+13 ms) increased interatrial conduction time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three drugs caused a significant increase in atrial effective refractory period (aERP) and, thus, an increase in atrial post-repolarization refractoriness (aPRR: +11 ms each, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the left atrium reduced aAPD(90) and aERP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The described drug effects were preserved in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> atrial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> atrial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> significantly increased the incidence of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ranolazine and flecainide, but not sotalol, decreased the number of responses.CONCLUSION: Ranolazine-related <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel block is preserved upon <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> atrial stretch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ranolazine suppresses stretch-induced AF by increasing interatrial conduction time and aPRR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results shed further evidence on the potential role of RAN in the prevention of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This might also apply to clinical conditions that are associated with haemodynamic or mechanical disorders, leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the atria </plain></SENT>
