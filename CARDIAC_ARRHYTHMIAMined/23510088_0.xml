<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Triggers from thoracic veins have been implicated not only in the initiation, but also in the perpetuation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (PAF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate their role we studied the distribution and stability of dominant frequencies (DFs) during PAF and the response to isolation of the triggering pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Triggering structures inducing PAF were identified during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> challenge in 26 patients (15 males, 55 ± 8.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During sustained PAF, sequential recordings were made with a decapolar circular mapping catheter from each <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> and the left atrial posterior wall (LAPW), together with coronary sinus (CS) and right atrium (RA) recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DF was determined using fast Fourier transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recordings were repeated after ≥15 minutes of PAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency ablation was directed first at the triggering <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PAF initiated from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> in 24 patients and from RA in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant frequency gradient from the triggering structure to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e>, CS, LAPW, and RA (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During the second recording, DF decreased at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sites (P &lt; 0.02), but the frequency gradient remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite isolation of the triggering <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>, PAF continued in 53% of patients, although DF measured in the CS was lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>AF termination occurred with contralateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation in half of the remaining patients and further AF slowing was noted in the rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Triggering structures harbor the fastest activity during sustained PAF pointing to their leading role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> perpetuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, nontriggering <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> also seem to contribute to PAF maintenance </plain></SENT>
