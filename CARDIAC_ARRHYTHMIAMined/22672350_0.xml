<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we have described an echocardiographic-based global cardiac calcification scoring system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate the severity of cardiac calcification in patients with permanent pacemakers as based on this scoring system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with a pacemaker implanted within the 2-year study period with a previous echocardiogram were identified and underwent blinded global cardiac calcium scoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients were compared to matched control patients without a pacemaker who also underwent calcium scoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study group consisted of 49 patients with pacemaker implantation who were compared to 100 matched control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean calcium score in the pacemaker group was 3.3 ± 2.9 versus 1.8 ± 2.0 (P = 0.006) in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed glomerular filtration rate and calcium scoring to be significant predictors of the presence of a pacemaker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Echocardiographic-based calcium scoring correlates with the presence of severe conduction disease requiring a pacemaker </plain></SENT>
