<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Study was performed with the eligible patients had a histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of malignant disease with no known <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, valvular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiograms of 14 voluntary patients were recorded for duration of 5 min just before and after irradiation for the first and the 15th fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ANS-related HRV analysis parameters were calculated as which were recommended by Task Force of ESC/NASPE (Circulation 93:1043-1065, 1996) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HRV parameters that belong to pre- and post-RT treatment of patients were compared statistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that there is not effect of single-dose radiation on HRV parameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean RRI (782.29 ± 115.65-738.93 ± 111.01, P &lt; 0.014) and HF power of HRVs PSD (156.94 ± 229.37-60.71 ± 77.99, P &lt; 0.045) decreased, and LF/HF ratio (1.38 ± 0.79-2.03 ± 1.25, P &lt; 0.039) increased significantly with 28-Gy external radiation dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As the effect of cumulative dose was investigated on HRV parameters, the above changes were continued to increase with 30-Gy external radiation dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that mediastinal RT involving heart directly in the radiation field decreased vagal and sympathetic ANS activities, and autonomic balance shifted toward sympathetic dominance </plain></SENT>
