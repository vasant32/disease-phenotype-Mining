<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of ultrasonographic and fluoroscopic navigation on the rate of procedural and early complications during central venous cannulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated procedural and early complications in patients who had undergone central venous cannulation under sonographic and fluoroscopic control within a two year period (from January 2010 to December 2011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied procedural and early complications (within 24 hours after the procedure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We summarized <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo>, haemothorax and haematoma of soft tissue larger than 5 cm in long axis, and other severe complications e.g. ardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The set of patients indicated for central venous cannulation included mainly oncological patients who were implanted central venous port systems, and a small group of patients who were cannulated either at the intensive care unit (ICU) or at the department of anesthesiology after unsuccessful blind cannulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were three patients cannulated because of transjugular liver biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We cannulated 165 patients under sonographic control within two years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 66 men, the mean age of 58.6 years (20-82) and 99 women, the mean age of 58.3 years (36- 94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We cannulated internal jugular vein 148 times and subclavian vein 17 times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The primary technical success was 100% in our study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Totally, we had 6 complications (3.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Immediatelly after the procedure we observed two pneumothoraxes (1.2%) which did not require chest drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We punctured artery wall three times, but without haematoma developement, and after a ten-minute commpression, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> procedures were successfully finished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We had serious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042420" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vagal reaction</z:e> during the cannulation in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We had no fatal procedural complication in our group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There are significantly fewer complications using jugular approach compared to subclavian one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that the ultrasonographic central venous cannulation is a very safe method with a low risk of procedural and early complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>There were significantly fewer complications in case of jugular cannulation compared to subclavian approach in our group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonographically navigated central venous cannulation should be used more fequently in emergency medicine as well as in case of non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> central venous cannulation performed a tan intensive care unit or by anesthesiologists </plain></SENT>
