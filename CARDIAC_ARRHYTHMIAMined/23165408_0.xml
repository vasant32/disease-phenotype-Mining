<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the data collected in the National Association of Hospital Cardiologists Toscana grown-up CHD (GUCH) registry over its first 8-month enrolment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Registry included consecutive patients aged more than 16 years with a documented diagnosis of CHD, enrolled in seven different Tuscan hospitals using a web-based electronic form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Severe CHD was defined as <z:mp ids='MP_0001575'>cyanotic</z:mp> CHD, or acyanotic lesion with significant haemodynamic impact requiring surgical and/or percutaneous correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between November 2009 and June 2010 a total of 1641 patients (mean age 41.8 ± 19.3 years, 52.2% women) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>Atrial septal defect</z:hpo> was the most common lesion, accounting for more than one-third of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Atrial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defects</z:hpo> together accounted for about half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CHDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nearly one-third of patients had New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 2 or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A history of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> was reported in 15% of cases, and 12% of patients were on oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> at the time of enrolment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> was 6%, and the prevalence of Eisenmenger syndrome was 1.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Severe CHD was present in 42% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Younger age, higher NYHA class, male sex, and the need for oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> were the only independent predictors of severe CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Information about the clinical characteristics and the CHD type distribution of a sample of Tuscan GUCH population was provided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Severe CHD accounts for about 40% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CHDs in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CHD severity is associated with younger age, male gender, worse NYHA class, and need for oral anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
