<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, maternal emotional support was investigated as a potential time-varying predictor of these trajectories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Physiological measures were obtained during frustration tasks, and a maternal emotional support measure was assessed via maternal report and direct observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Children's baseline RSA and vagal withdrawal scores were moderately stable across the preschool period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Growth models indicated that children's baseline RSA scores changed linearly over the preschool years, and there was significant variability in withdrawal trajectories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Greater maternal emotional support predicted higher initial withdrawal levels and lower emotional support was associated with the greatest increase in withdrawal over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that children of higher emotionally supportive mothers reached higher levels of physiological regulation earlier in development and therefore did not show the same increase across preschool as children of less supportive mothers </plain></SENT>
