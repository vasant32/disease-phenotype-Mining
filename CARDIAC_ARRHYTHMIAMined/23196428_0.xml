<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to investigate its direct electrophysiological effects on isolated ventricular myocytes from rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique was used to measure action potential (AP) and membrane currents in single ventricular myocytes enzymatically isolated from adult rabbit hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ca(2+) transients were recorded in myocytes loaded with the Ca(2+) indicator Fluo-4AM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among three bioactive substances of Polygala metabolites, only M-TMCA (15-30 µM) significantly shortened action potential duration at 50% and 90% repolarization (APD(50) and APD(90)) in cardiomyocytes in a concentration-dependent and a reversible manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>M-TMCA also inhibited L-type calcium current (I(Ca,L)), but showed effect on neither transient outward <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current (I(to)) nor steady-state <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current (I(K,SS)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, M-TMCA abolished <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoprenaline</z:chebi> plus BayK8644-induced early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and suppressed delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) and triggered activities (TAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This potential anti-arrhythmic effects were likely attributed by the inhibition of I(Ca,L) and the suppression of intracellular Ca(2+) transients, which consequently suppress the generation of transient inward current (I(ti)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that M-TMCA may protect the heart from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> via its inhibitory effect on calcium channel </plain></SENT>
