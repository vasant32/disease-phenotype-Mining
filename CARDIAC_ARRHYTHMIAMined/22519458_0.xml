<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of clinical symptoms usually occurs during childhood, and is typically related to exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to describe the clinical characteristics of seven Czech families with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> and the results of mutational analysis of the RyR2 gene in these families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects and their relatives were investigated at the participating departments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They underwent basic clinical investigation, and history was focused on possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> symptoms, that is, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncopes</z:hpo> during exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bicycle ergometry was performed to obtain electrocardiogram recording during adrenergic stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the investigated individuals, blood samples were taken for mutation analysis of the RyR2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: To date, seven families have been investigated, comprising 11 adults and 13 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> patients, the indication for examination was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> during exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was confirmed by bicycle ergometry-induced polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In one relative, polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> was also induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eight affected individuals were treated with Î²-blockers and in two, a cardioverter-defibrillator was implanted due to recurrent syncopi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Coding variants of the RyR2 gene were found in four probands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is a systematic description of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> families in the Czech Republic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our data support the importance of exercise testing for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In addition, RyR2 gene coding variants were found in 50% of affected individuals </plain></SENT>
