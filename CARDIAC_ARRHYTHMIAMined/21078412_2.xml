<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although several ECG algorithms have been proposed for differentiating the origins of outflow tract <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> (OT-VA), their accuracy still is limited in cases with cardiac rotation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess whether a novel "cardiac rotation-corrected" transitional zone (TZ) index would be a useful marker for differentiating right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) origin from aortic sinus cusp (ASC) origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Surface ECGs of OT-VAs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and inferior axis in 112 patients who were successfully ablated in the RVOT (n = 87) or the ASC (n = 25) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The TZ index was defined according to the site of R-wave transition of sinus beats and OT-VAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The TZ index was significantly lower in the ASC origin than in the RVOT origin (-1.2 ± 0.9 vs 0.3 ± 0.7, P &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A cutoff value of the TZ index &lt;0 predicted the ASC origin with 88% sensitivity and 82% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The previously reported R-wave duration index ≥ 50% had a high specificity of 85% but a low sensitivity of 44%, and R/S-wave amplitude index ≥ 30% had 68% sensitivity and 79% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The area under the curve by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was 0.90 for the TZ index, which was significantly higher than the R-wave duration index and R/S-wave amplitude index of 0.74 and 0.76, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This novel TZ index can be a more useful marker for differentiating RVOT origin from ASC origin </plain></SENT>
