<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rapid, irregular, and disordered electrical activity in the atria gives rise to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> and dizziness with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with AF have a five-fold higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oral anticoagulation (OAC) with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> is commonly used for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention in patients with AF and has been shown to reduce the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by 64% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> therapy has several major disadvantages, however, including <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, non-tolerance, interactions with other medications and foods, non-compliance and a narrow therapeutic range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These issues, together with poor appreciation of the risk-benefit ratio, unawareness of guidelines, or absence of an OAC monitoring outpatient clinic may explain why only 30-60% of patients with AF are prescribed this drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The problems associated with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, combined with the limited efficacy and/or serious side effects associated with other medications used for AF, highlight the need for effective non-pharmacological approaches to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One such approach is catheter ablation (CA), a procedure in which a radiofrequency electrical current is applied to regions of the heart to create small ablation lesions that electrically isolate potential AF triggers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CA is a well-established treatment for AF symptoms, that may also decrease the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recent data showed a significant decrease in the relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> events among patients who underwent ablation compared with those undergoing antiarrhythmic drug therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since the left atrial appendage (LAA) is the source of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in more than 90% of patients with non-valvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, another approach to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention is to physically block clots from exiting the LAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One method for occluding the LAA is via percutaneous placement of the WATCHMAN LAA closure device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The WATCHMAN device resembles a small parachute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It consists of a nitinol frame covered by fabric polyethyl terephthalate that prevents emboli, but not blood, from exiting during the healing process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Fixation anchors around the perimeter secure the device in the LAA (Figure 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>To date, the WATCHMAN is the only implanted percutaneous device for which a randomized clinical trial has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In this study, implantation of the WATCHMAN was found to be at least as effective as <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> in preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-causes) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-causes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This device received the Conformité Européenne (CE) mark for use in the European Union for <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> eligible patients and in those who have a contraindication to anticoagulation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Given the proven effectiveness of CA to alleviate AF symptoms and the promising data with regard to reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> with both CA and WATCHMAN implantation, combining the two procedures is hoped to further reduce the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in high-risk patients while simultaneously relieving symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The combined procedure may eventually enable patients to undergo implantation of the WATCHMAN device without subsequent <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> treatment, since the CA procedure itself reduces <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>This would present an avenue of treatment previously unavailable to patients ineligible for <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> treatment because of recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> or other <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>-associated problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The combined procedure is performed under general anesthesia with biplane fluoroscopy and TEE guidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Catheter ablation is followed by implantation of the WATCHMAN LAA closure device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Data from a non-randomized trial with 10 patients demonstrates that this procedure can be safely performed in patients with a CHADS2 score of greater than 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Further studies to examine the effectiveness of the combined procedure in reducing symptoms from AF and associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are therefore warranted </plain></SENT>
