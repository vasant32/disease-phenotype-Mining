<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite TATS's crucial role in excitation-contraction coupling and morphological alterations found in pathological settings, TATS's electrical activity has never been directly investigated in remodeled tubular networks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we develop an ultrafast random access multiphoton microscope that, in combination with a customly synthesized voltage-sensitive dye, is used to simultaneously measure action potentials (APs) at multiple sites within the sarcolemma with submillisecond temporal and submicrometer spatial resolution in real time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We find that the tight electrical coupling between different sarcolemmal domains is guaranteed only within an intact tubular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In fact, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> detachment by osmotic shock of most tubules from the surface sarcolemma prevents AP propagation not only in the disconnected tubules, but also in some of the tubules that remain connected with the surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This indicates that a structural disorganization of the tubular system worsens the electrical coupling between the TATS and the surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pathological implications of this finding are investigated in failing hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We find that AP propagation into the pathologically remodeled TATS frequently fails and may be followed by local spontaneous electrical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings provide insight on the relationship between abnormal TATS and asynchronous calcium release, a major determinant of cardiac contractile dysfunction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
