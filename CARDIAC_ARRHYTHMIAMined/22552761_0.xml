<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Bifocal pacing in the right ventricle is an option for patients with end-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in whom biventricular pacing is not possible, due to failure in left ventricular (LV) lead insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this prospective study was to document the clinical response of these patients, after bifocal pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From the patients referred for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), from 2009 to 2010, 13 cardiac CRT candidates who underwent unsuccessful LV lead implantation were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The bifocal system's leads were implanted in the right atrium, the right ventricular (RV) apex, and the RV outflow tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initial patient assessment and follow-up evaluation after 6 months included clinical criteria, echocardiographic indices, and biochemical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 13 patients (age 68 ± 9 years, nine male), 10 improved clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>New York Heart Association classification was reduced by one grade (from 3.6 ± 0.5 to 2.8 ± 0.8, p &lt; 0.005 and respectively), while hospitalizations in 6-month time were reduced from three to one (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six-minute walk test (in meters) increased from 176 ± 86 to 297 ± 91 (p &lt; 0.001) and quality of life improved (EQ-VAS scale changed from 42 ± 12.5 % to 70.8 ± 20.3 %, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean shortening in QRS duration was 31.3 ms (from 165.1 ± 16.3 to 133.8 ± 12.7, p &lt; 0.001) and B-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (in picograms per milliliter) dropped from 834 ± 350 to 621 ± 283 (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ejection fraction (in percent) increased from 27.5 ± 4.6 to 33.3 ± 4.4 (p &lt; 0.001), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> severity decreased by one grade (from 2.7 ± 0.9 to 1.8 ± 0.7, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: RV bifocal pacing seems to offer a substantial clinical benefit to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients with traditional CRT indications and could be an alternative option when LV access is unsuccessful </plain></SENT>
