<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Endovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> repair (EVAR) is associated with reduced cardiac stress compared with open repair and is an attractive therapeutic option, especially in cardiac fragile patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>General and locoregional anaesthesia differ regarding the stress response evoked by surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study is to compare the incidence of cardiac events after EVAR under general or locoregional anaesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 302 consecutive patients undergoing infrarenal EVAR between 2002 and 2011 were analysed in this retrospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Selection of anaesthesia type was at the discretion of the treating physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Medical history, medication use, anaesthesia technique and follow-up were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study end point was 30-day cardiac complications, including cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, non-fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> and troponin T release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis, adjusted for the propensity of receiving a locoregional technique and cardiac risk factors according to the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, was used to assess the association between cardiac events and anaesthesia type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 173 patients underwent general anaesthesia and 129 locoregional anaesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo>, aspirin use and therapeutic anticoagulation were more common in patients receiving general anaesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cardiac events were observed in 13.3% of patients receiving general anaesthesia and in 4.7% of patients receiving locoregional anaesthesia (P = 0.02), or 6.4% versus .8% (P = 0.02) when asymptomatic troponin release is excluded from the end point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the general anaesthesia group, two cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, six non-fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo>, two cases of non-fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, one non-fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> and 12 cases of troponin T release were observed, compared with one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and five cases of troponin T release in the locoregional anaesthesia group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, general anaesthesia was associated with adverse cardiac events (odds ratio (OR) 3.8; 95%-confidence interval (CI) 1.1-12.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Non-cardiac complications occurred in 11.6% of patients in both groups (P = 1.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: General anaesthesia was associated with an increased risk of cardiac events in EVAR, compared with locoregional anaesthesia </plain></SENT>
