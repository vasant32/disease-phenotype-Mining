<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In addition to lowering cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> stabilise atherosclerotic plaques and can potentially reduce the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that prior <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy is associated with a lower incidence of inhospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome (ACS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population consisted of 2007 patients (mean age 64 years, 67.5% male) enrolled in the Thai Registry of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> Coronary Syndrome, a prospective, multicentre, nationwide, observational study of patients with ACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were categorised as either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> users or non-users according to their reports of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use before enrolment at their initial presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was inhospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The secondary endpoint was a composite endpoint of inhospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> or inhospital cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A propensity-adjusted multivariate model was developed to assess the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use on the primary and secondary endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a mean hospital stay of 7 days, a total of 96 patients (4.8%) died; 82 (4.1%) of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were due to cardiac causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The primary and secondary endpoints were reached in 163 patients (8.1%) and 194 patients (9.7%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of 525 patients (26.2%) had used <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> prior to hospitalisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for the propensity scores and other relevant covariates, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use was associated with lower risks of the primary (adjusted OR 0.505, 95% CI 0.276 to 0.923) and secondary endpoints (adjusted OR 0.498, 95% CI 0.276 to 0.897) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> is associated with a reduced incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> among patients with ACS </plain></SENT>
