<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When considering <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, about 30% are classified as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of unknown cause or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The increasing time of ventricular depolarization and repolarization, measured non-invasively by measuring the QT interval on the electrocardiogram at rest, has emerged as a predictor of complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, a major cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine the electrocardiographic alterations present in hemodialysis (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) patients, measuring the QT interval and its relationship with clinical and laboratory variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients above 18 years on dialysis were approached to participate in the study and, after consent, were submitted to the examination of 12-lead electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical data were reviewed to assess the presence of comorbidities, as well as anthropometric and blood pressure measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were collected to determinate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> and serum levels of calcium, <z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">phosphorus</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and seventy nine patients were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority of the patients were male (64.8%) and white (54.7%); the average age was 58.5 Â± 14.7 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>About 50% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had, at least, one electrical conduction disturb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>About 50% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had QTc prolongation and experienced a significant increase in the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>Left Ventricular Hypertrophy</z:hpo> (LVH), changes of the cardiac rhythm and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011710'>bundle branch blocks</z:hpo>, and a lower body mass index (BMI), when compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> QTc interval patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> (CKD) on hemodialysis had high frequency of abnormal electrocardiographic findings, including a high prevalence of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005184'>prolonged QTc interval</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study also found a significant association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0005184'>prolonged QTc interval</z:hpo> and the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and lower values of BMI </plain></SENT>
