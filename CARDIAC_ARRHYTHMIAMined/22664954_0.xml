<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Controversy continues concerning the choice of rhythm control vs rate control treatment strategies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A recent clinical trial showed no difference in 5-year mortality between the 2 treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine whether the 2 strategies have similar effectiveness when applied to a general population of patients with AF with longer follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used population-based administrative databases from Quebec, Canada, from 1999 to 2007 to select patients 66 years or older hospitalized with an AF diagnosis who did not have AF-related drug prescriptions in the year before the admission but received a prescription within 7 days of discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed until <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or administrative censoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mortality was analyzed by multivariable Cox regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 26,130 patients followed for a mean (SD) period of 3.1 years (2.3 years), there were 13,237 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (49.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for covariates, we found that the effect of rhythm vs rate control drugs changed over time: after a small increase in mortality for patients treated with rhythm control in the 6 months following treatment initiation (hazard ratio [HR], 1.07; 95% CI, 1.01-1.14), the mortality was similar between the 2 groups until year 4 but decreased steadily in the rhythm control group after year 5 (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81-0.96; and HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62-0.95, after 5 and 8 years, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based sample of patients with AF, we found little difference in mortality within 4 years of treatment initiation between patients with AF initiating rhythm control therapy vs those initiating rate control therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, rhythm control therapy seems to be superior in the long-term </plain></SENT>
