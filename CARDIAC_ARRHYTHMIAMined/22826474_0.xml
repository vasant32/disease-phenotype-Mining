<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We examined the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="53204">NIS</z:chebi>) database to compare short-term postoperative outcomes following open and thoracoscopic lobectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thoracoscopic (video-assisted thoracic surgery) lobectomy has been demonstrated to be associated with fewer postoperative complications compared with open thoracotomy lobectomy in several large case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, as no randomized trial has been performed, there are many who question this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53204">NIS</z:chebi> database for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing lobectomy as their principal procedure either via thoracoscopic or open thoracotomy from 2007 to 08 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared the postoperative outcomes of these two groups of patients after propensity matching these groups based on several preoperative variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over a 2-year-period, 68 350 patients underwent a lobectomy by either thoracoscopy [n = 10 554 (15%)] or thoracotomy [n = 57 796(85%)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two percent of thoracoscopic lobectomies (n = 3421) were performed in either rural or non-teaching urban centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although in propensity-matched cohorts there was no difference in operative mortality, thoracoscopic lobectomy was associated with a lower incidence of postoperative complications [n = 4146 (40.8%) vs n = 13 913 (45.1%), P &lt; 0.001] and shorter length of stay (5.0 vs 7.0 days; P &lt; 0.001) compared with open lobectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Specifically, the incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_609'>empyema</z:mpath> were lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This large national database study demonstrates that thoracoscopic lobectomy is associated with fewer in-hospital postoperative complications compared with open lobectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thoracoscopic lobectomy appears to be applicable to the wider general thoracic surgical community </plain></SENT>
