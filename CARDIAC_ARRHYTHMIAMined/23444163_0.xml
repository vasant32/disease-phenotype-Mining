<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The understanding of the etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> has changed considerably within the last few years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The changes have significant implications for the medical management of the disease, as well as on the ability to provide proper dental treatment for these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD AND MATERIALS: A retrospective observational study of the outcome following dental treatment of 54 patients was performed: 32 with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> stage D (study group) and 22 patients at risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> stages A to C (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dental management of these patients concentrated on the prevention of iatrogenic, dental setting- induced, and precipitating factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To prevent deterioration of patients' medical condition, a comprehensive, tailored treatment including adequate anxiolysis, close monitoring, profound dental anesthesia, and close follow-up was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A previously described three-step gradual level protocol (at home, waiting room, and dental chair) was adopted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the planned dental procedures were successfully completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> during treatment, and five patients demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> during dental treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only minute differences were found between the groups regarding blood pressure and heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Use of the suggested protocol facilitated the completion of planned dental treatments for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, providing essential dental treatment for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients with special attention to their medical problems and the use of medications and supporting means to prevent health-compromising situations is recommended </plain></SENT>
