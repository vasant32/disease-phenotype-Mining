<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Rapid conversion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) to sinus rhythm may be achieved by the administration of class IA, IC and III antiarrhythmic drugs or vernakalant <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, that treatment may be related to potential pro-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, lack of efficacy or the exceptionally high cost of a compound used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antazoline is a first generation antihistaminic agent with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">chinidin</z:chebi>-like properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When administered intravenously, antazoline exerts a strong antiarrhythmic effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>, especially on AF, facilitating rapid conversion to sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite a relative lack of published data antazoline has been marketed in Poland and widely used in cardiology wards and emergency rooms for many years due to its efficacy, safety and rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of action within minutes of administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS/DESIGN: A randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, superiority clinical trial was designed to assess clinical efficacy of antazoline in rapid conversion of AF to sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eligible patients will present AF lasting less than 43 hours, will be in stable cardio-pulmonary condition and will have no prior history of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> or significant valvular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Long-term antiarrhythmic therapy is not considered an exclusion criterion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subjects who fulfill selection criteria will be randomly assigned to receive intravenously either antazoline or placebo in divided doses and observed for 1.5 hours after conversion to sinus rhythm or after the last i.v. bolus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Primary end point will be the conversion of AF to sinus rhythm confirmed in an electrocardiogram (ECG) during the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points will be comprised of time to conversion and return of AF during the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Special consideration will be given to the observation of any adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A sample size of 80 patients was calculated based on the following assumptions: two-tailed test, a type I error of 0.01, a power of 90%, efficacy of placebo 5%, efficacy of antazoline 50% and 20% drop-out rate to fulfill the criteria of intention-to-treat analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Due to the presumed lack of statistical power, the secondary end points and safety endpoints will be considered exploratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRY: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01527279 </plain></SENT>
