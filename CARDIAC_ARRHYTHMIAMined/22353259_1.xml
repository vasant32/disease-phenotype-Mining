<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: It is generally accepted that at least 2 major mechanisms contribute to sinus node (SN) pacemaking: a membrane voltage (mainly I(f) ) clock and a calcium (Ca) clock (localized submembrane sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release during late diastolic depolarization) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare the contributions of each mechanism to pacemaker activity in SN and Purkinje fibers (PFs) exhibiting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or abnormal automaticity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Conventional microelectrodes were used to record action potentials in isolated spontaneously beating canine SN and free running PF in control and in the presence of 0.1 μM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">Ryanodine</z:chebi> (0.1-3 μM) and ivabradine (3 μM) were used to inhibit sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release or I(f), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To induce automaticity at low membrane potentials, PFs were superfused with BaCl(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In SN, ivabradine reduced the rate whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">Isoproterenol</z:chebi> significantly accelerated automatic rate, which was decreased by ivabradine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In normally polarized PFs, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> had no effects on the automatic rate in the absence or presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi>, whereas ivabradine inhibited both control and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi>-accelerated automaticity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In PF depolarized with BaCl(2), ivabradine decreased BaCl(2) -induced automatic rate while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In canine SN, I(f) contributes to both basal automaticity and β-adrenergic-induced rate acceleration while the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi>-inhibited Ca clock appears more involved in β-adrenergic regulation of pacemaker rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In PF, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> automaticity depends mainly on I(f) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of basal <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> conductance results in high automatic rates at depolarized membrane potentials with SN-like responses to inhibition of membrane and Ca clocks </plain></SENT>
