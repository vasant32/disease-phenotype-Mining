<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35523">Bronchodilators</z:chebi> are first-line therapy for COPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is some evidence that they may increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the computerized health-care databases of the Province of Saskatchewan, Canada, to identify a cohort of subjects with COPD, aged ≥ 55 years, between 1990 and 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subjects were followed until December 2003 for a hospital admission for, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A nested case-control approach was used to match each <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> case on age, sex, and calendar time to 20 control subjects selected from the corresponding cohort risk set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the rate ratio (RR) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> associated with new use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35523">bronchodilators</z:chebi>, adjusted for disease severity and comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cohort included 6,018 patients with COPD in whom 469 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> cases occurred, including 56 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, for an overall rate of 1.37 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> per 100 per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was elevated with the new use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5956">ipratropium</z:chebi> (RR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.4-4.0) and of long-acting β-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> (LABAs) (RR, 4.5; 95% CI, 1.4-14.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was not elevated with new use of short-acting β-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> (RR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.5-1.6) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25348">methylxanthines</z:chebi> (RR, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.7-3.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The new use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35523">bronchodilators</z:chebi>, particularly <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5956">ipratropium</z:chebi> and LABAs, may increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> in patients with COPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although these results raise concerns regarding LABAs, they were based on few cases and require confirmation in larger cohorts </plain></SENT>
