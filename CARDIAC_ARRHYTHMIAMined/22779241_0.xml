<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Contrast radiographs of esophagus and stomach revealed an intrathoracic radiodensity that contains filling defects typical of stomach, consistent with gastric rugal folds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mural thickening was observed at the level of the cardia consistent with a diagnosis of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although clinical improvement was noted with medical therapy and tube feeding, surgical correction of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> was considered necessary for full resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, owing to the animal's <z:hpo ids='HP_0004325'>low body weight</z:hpo>, the corrective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> surgery was postponed until the body condition improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The seal needed to be surgically treated for a <z:mp ids='MP_0009825'>corneal ulcer</z:mp>, and while anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi>, the seal became dyspneic and developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>; ultimately <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> ensued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Resuscitation was unsuccessfully attempted and the seal was euthanized </plain></SENT>
