<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Novel facilities such as an intensive observation unit and an outpatient clinic could result in improving management of patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This observational study enrolled 3475 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group 1 (1120 patients; years 2004-2005) was managed with standard approach; group 2 (992 patients; years 2006-2007) was managed with additional intensive observation; group 3 (1363 patients; years 2008-2009) was managed with additional intensive observation and outpatient clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary end point was admission to hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points included modalities of rhythm conversion and administration of class IC vs class III antiarrhythmic drugs in patients with AF lasting less than 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lack of rhythm control, comorbidities, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and age were independent predictors of hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Admissions significantly decreased from group 1 (50%) to 2 (38%) and to 3 (24%) (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, more than a quarter of patients in group 3 were referred to the outpatient clinic for short-term follow-up, eventually avoiding admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with AF lasting less than 48 hours (n = 2189) and without structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> (n = 1685) achieved sinus rhythm in 89% of cases and were discharged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In these patients, early administration of antiarrhythmic drugs of class IC and III gained sinus rhythm in 80% and 20%, respectively (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous conversion occurred in 26%; electrical, 17%; and pharmacological, 57% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with AF, beyond the standard approach, the novel organization with an additional intensive observation unit for early pharmacological interventions and an outpatient clinic for elective treatment and short-term follow-up significantly reduced admission irrespective of independent predictors of hospitalizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients without structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> treated with antiarrhythmic drugs achieved sinus rhythm in 89% of cases, mostly with class IC drugs </plain></SENT>
