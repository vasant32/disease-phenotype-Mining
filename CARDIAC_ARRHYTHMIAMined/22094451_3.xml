<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study will investigate the impact of pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> assessed by pre-interventional cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) on endoscopic PVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-one patients (23 females, age 57 ± 9 years) with a long history (5 ± 5 years) of drug-refractory PAF were included into our analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients before ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each CMRI was evaluated for the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e>, for separate or common insertion of ipsilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e>, for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> diameter and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> shape (round vs. oval), for the level of first <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> branching, and for the level of insertion of the right inferior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> (RIPV) into the left atrium (LA), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary vein isolation was performed using exclusively the novel EAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CMRI findings were correlated with the ablation results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 195 PVs were identified and targeted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 192 of 195 (98%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> successful isolation was achieved using the novel EAS irrespective of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> diameter, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> shape, the level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> branching, or the type of insertion of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> into the LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical significance when correlating the CMRI findings with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> isolation success of the respective <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> or the number of laser applications needed until PVI (P&gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A low level of insertion of the RIPV into the LA was not associated with PVI failure or a higher number of laser applications (P&gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> could have been targeted and successfully isolated using exclusively the novel EAS irrespective of their <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> assessed by pre-interventional CMRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Considering the economical impact of CMRI and its minor influence on ablation strategy, success, and safety it is not an essential pre-requisite for subsequent successful EAS-based PVI </plain></SENT>
