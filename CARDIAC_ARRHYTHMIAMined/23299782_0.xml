<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the pathophysiological processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An important limitation has been the difficulty of using human cardiomyocytes to study <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and identify drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To circumvent this issue, we have developed a method using human-induced pluripotent stem cells to generate cardiomyocytes from individuals with Timothy syndrome (TS), a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorder</z:e> characterized by QT prolongation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The TS ventricular-like cardiomyocytes exhibit deficits in contraction, electrical signaling, and calcium handling, as revealed by live cell imaging and electrophysiological studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We tested candidate drugs in TS cardiomyocytes and found that roscovitine could successfully rescue these <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cellular phenotypes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The use of a human cellular model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> provides a useful new platform not only to study disease mechanisms but also to develop new therapies to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
