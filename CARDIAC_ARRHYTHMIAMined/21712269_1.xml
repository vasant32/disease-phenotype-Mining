<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test the ability of <z:mp ids='MP_0010594'>TAV</z:mp> to identify patients presenting with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> and to predict subsequent occurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 20 consecutive patients (age 42 ± 15 years, mean ± standard deviation) presenting with ventricular tachyarrhythmia who did not have substantial underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> and compared them with 40 age- and sex-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0010594'>TAV</z:mp> was determined by Holter recording (Ela Medical) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmia had a higher maximum value of <z:mp ids='MP_0010594'>TAV</z:mp> (max <z:mp ids='MP_0010594'>TAV</z:mp>: 38 ± 18 vs. 22 ± 15 μV, P &lt; 0.001) than did the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of max <z:mp ids='MP_0010594'>TAV</z:mp> &gt; 22.4 μV for detecting the occurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia were 77 and 90%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up period of 23 months, three patients had relapses of ventricular tachyarrhythmia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with a recurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia had a trend towards a higher max <z:mp ids='MP_0010594'>TAV</z:mp> as compared with those who had ventricular tachyarrhythmia but did not relapse (56 ± 23 vs. 36 ± 16 μV, P = 0.061) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that Holter-derived <z:mp ids='MP_0010594'>TAV</z:mp> might be associated with the occurrence and recurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia in patients without structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prospective validation will be necessary to assess the potential diagnostic value of the <z:mp ids='MP_0010594'>TAV</z:mp> in a large general population </plain></SENT>
