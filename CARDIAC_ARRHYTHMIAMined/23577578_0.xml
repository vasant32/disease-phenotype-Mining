<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, flexible thin diagnostic catheters are introduced into the patient's heart and by pacing the heart from the atria and ventricles the properties of the heart's intrinsic conducting pathways are determined, as well as whether the patient has potentially treatable structures (substrates) causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study is to initiate an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> similar to that having caused the patient to seek medical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> can often be simultaneously treated with catether ablation </plain></SENT>
