<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here a case in which this examination identified the presence of a maternal atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE: A 50-year-old woman with no significant past medical history received antenatal care in our fetal medicine unit clinic because of advanced maternal age, a history of recurrent pregnancy loss, multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0000131'>uterine fibroids</z:hpo>, and a history of in vitro fertilization using donated oocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Uterine artery Doppler ultrasound was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at 19 weeks, but was repeated at 33 weeks because of abnormal placental texture and maternal risks, revealing an irregular maternal heart rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was confirmed by Holter monitor at 34 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient was asymptomatic and declined the cardiologist's recommendation of antepartum and postpartum anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>She remained asymptomatic and had delivery by Caesarean section at term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Uterine artery Doppler flow studies may identify a significant maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
