<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the 2011 guidelines of the Japanese Circulation Society for non-pharmacotherapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, catheter ablation is recommended as Class I therapeutic modality for the patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Catheter ablation of AF is an invasive and long-lasting procedure necessitating sedation during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in the most of the patients, sedation or anesthesia is possibly performed by cardiologists using <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi>, midazolam or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4466">dexmedetomidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Deep sedation accompanies a high risk of ventilatory or circulatory derangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, life-threatening complications, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac tamponade</z:e>, can occur during ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with AF are increasing in number as a trend in the aging society, resulting in an increase in catheter ablation in high risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To accomplish safe <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> management of the patients for catheter ablations, anesthesiologists are required to have fundamental knowledge and skill in the performance of the catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
