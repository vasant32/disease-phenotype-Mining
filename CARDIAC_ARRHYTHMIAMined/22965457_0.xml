<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical results in cardiac surgery patients are controversial and may be related to the timing of administration of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anaesthetics</z:chebi> intraoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We hypothesised that the cardioprotective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> in coronary bypass graft surgical patients would be greater if administration during anaesthesia continued in the ICU for at least 4 h postoperatively until weaning from mechanical ventilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Double-blind, double-dummy, prospective, randomised and controlled clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: In a single centre between June 2006 and June 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Seventy-five adult patients were assigned randomly to receive anaesthesia and postoperative sedation either with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> (control, n = 37) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> (n = 36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Myocardial biomarkers were measured before surgery, at the time of admission to the intensive care unit and at 6, 24, 48 and 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The need for inotropic support, and lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital were also recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Elevation of myocardial biomarkers was the primary endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The secondary endpoints were haemodynamic events and lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>Necrosis</z:mp> biomarkers increased significantly in the postoperative period in both groups with no significant differences at any time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Inotropic support was needed in 72.7 and 54.3% of patients in the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> groups, respectively (P = 0.086) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in haemodynamic variables, incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischaemia</z:e> or and lengths of stay in the ICU and hospital between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing coronary bypass graft surgery, continuous administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> as a sedative in the ICU for at least 4 h postoperatively did not yield significant improvements in the extent and time course of myocardial damage biomarkers compared to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
