<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In consequence, the number of those who reach adulthood is continuously growing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 2010, the European Society of Cardiology published guidelines for the management of grown-up <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (GUCH) and recommended that each GUCH patient should be examined at least once in a specialized center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Due to their specific needs, this population requires specific and organized care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indeed, GUCH patients do not only have significant extra-cardiac problems, but also present specific cardiac complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001708'>right ventricular failure</z:hpo>, incisionnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They may require repeated surgical and/ or percutaneous interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since this emerging population is ageing, they also may suffer from arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Last but not least, young women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> need specialized advice and care for contraception, follow-up during pregnancy and peripartal management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In order to optimize the follow-up of this growing population, a shared care model where cardiologists, specialized GUCH centers and other specialized centers for the treatment of extra-cardiac problems work in tight collaboration is recommended </plain></SENT>
