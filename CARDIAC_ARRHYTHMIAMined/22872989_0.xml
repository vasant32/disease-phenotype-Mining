<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: We investigated astronaut candidates' physiological and pathological responses to +Gx exposure during simulated emergency return from a running orbit to advance astronaut +Gx tolerance training and medical support in manned spaceflight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: There were 13 male astronaut candidates who were exposed to a simulated high +Gx acceleration profile in a spacecraft during an emergency return lasting for 230 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The peak value was 8.5 G </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjective feelings and symptoms, cardiovascular and respiratory responses, and changes in urine component before, during, and after +Gx exposure were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Under high +Gx exposure, 15.4% of subjects exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Heart rate (HR) increased significantly and four different types of HR response curves were distinguished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ratio of QT to RR interval on the electrocardiograms was significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) declined with increasing G value and then returned gradually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SaO2 reached a minimum (87.7%) at 3 G during the decline phase of the +Gx curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Respiratory rate increased significantly with increasing G value, while the amplitude and area of the respiratory waves were significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overshoot appeared immediately after +Gx exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A few subjects suffered from slight injuries, including positive urine protein (1/13), positive urinary occult blood (1/13), and a large area of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000967'>petechiae</z:hpo> on the back (1/13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Astronaut candidates have relatively good tolerance to the +Gx profile during a simulation of spacecraft emergent ballistic re-entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, a few subjects exhibited adverse physiological responses and slight reversible pathological injuries </plain></SENT>
