<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of oral ivabradine as a heart rate reducing agent in patients undergoing CT coronary angiography (CTCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the routine use of Î²-blockers prior to CTCA studies, it is not uncommon to have patients with heart rates persistently above the target range of 65 bpm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ivabradine is a selective inhibitor of the I(f) current, which primarily contributes to sinus node pacemaker activity, and has no significant direct cardiovascular effects such as reduction of blood pressure, cardiac contractility or impairment of cardiac conduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated 100 consecutive patients who had been referred for CTCA for the evaluation of suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomised to receive either of the following two pre-medication protocols: oral metorprolol or oral ivabradine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ivabradine was significantly more effective than metorprolol in lowering the heart rate; the mean percentage reduction in heart rate with ivabradine vs metorpolol was 23.89+6.95% vs 15.20+4.50%, respectively (p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">Metoprolol</z:chebi> significantly lowered both systolic and diastolic blood pressure while ivabradine did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The requirement of additional doses to achieve a target heart rate of &lt;65 beats per min was also significantly more frequent with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ivabradine is a potentially attractive alternative to currently used drugs for reduction of heart rate in patients undergoing CTCA </plain></SENT>
