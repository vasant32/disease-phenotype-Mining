<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) for idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> is typically guided by local activation time (LAT) mapping and unipolar electrogram <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> (QS configuration) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, LAT mapping is limited by the large variation among patients, and the area demonstrating a QS configuration of the unipolar electrogram may be larger than the focal source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reversed polarity has been proposed as a criterion for guiding RFCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of reversed polarity of adjacent bipolar electrograms for predicting a successful ablation site in idiopathic RVOT <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-five consecutive patients (12 men [48%], age 43 Â± 15 years) undergoing RFCA for RVOT <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electrograms of ablation sites and of points within a 15-mm radius to the successful site were evaluated for LAT, unipolar electrogram <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, and the presence of reversed polarity of adjacent bipolar electrograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electrogram characteristics of successful ablation sites were compared to those of nonsuccessful ablation sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The spatial distribution of each electrogram characteristic was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Successful ablation sites more often demonstrated reversed polarity and had an earlier LAT than nonsuccessful sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A wide spatial distribution was observed for unipolar electrograms with a QS configuration around the successful ablation site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mapping based on LAT and reversed polarity had a higher predictive value for a successful ablation site than mapping based on LAT and QS configuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of reversed polarity has a high predictive value for successful ablation sites in focal idiopathic RVOT <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and is likely to reduce the number of RFCA applications </plain></SENT>
