<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Catecholaminergic polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e>) is an inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> syndrome associated with mutations in the cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor gene (Ryr2) in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> patients mainly involved probands, so current insight into disease penetrance, expression, genotype-phenotype correlations, and arrhythmic event rates in relatives carrying the Ryr2 mutation is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: One-hundred sixteen relatives carrying the Ryr2 mutation from 15 families who were identified by cascade screening of the Ryr2 mutation causing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> in the proband were clinically characterized, including 61 relatives from 1 family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four of 108 antiarrhythmic drug-free relatives (50%) had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> phenotype at the first cardiological examination, including 27 (25%) with nonsustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relatives carrying a Ryr2 mutation in the C-terminal channel-forming domain showed an increased odds of nonsustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (odds ratio, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.5-11.5; P=0.007, compared with N-terminal domain) compared with N-terminal domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001688'>Sinus bradycardia</z:hpo> was observed in 19% of relatives, whereas other supraventricular dysrhythmias were present in 16% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ninety-eight (most actively treated) relatives (84%) were followed up for a median of 4.7 years (range, 0.3-19.0 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 2 asymptomatic relatives experienced exercise-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One relative was not being treated, whereas the other was noncompliant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the 116 relatives died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> during a 6.7-year follow-up (range, 1.4-20.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Relatives carrying an Ryr2 mutation show a marked phenotypic diversity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The vast majority do not have signs of supraventricular disease manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mutation location may be associated with severity of the phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The arrhythmic event rate during follow-up was low </plain></SENT>
