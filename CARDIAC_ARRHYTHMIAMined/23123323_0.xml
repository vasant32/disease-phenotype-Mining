<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, we have shown that elevated intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> causes a decrease in cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> current (I(Na)) signaled by an increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> reactive oxygen species (ROS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested whether the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi>-mitochondria ROS pathway was involved in the reduction of I(Na) in a nonischemic cardiomyopathic model and correlated the findings with myopathic human hearts </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to the sham mice, the arterial blood pressure was higher, the left ventricular volume was significantly enlarged (104.7±3.9 vs. 87.9±6.1 ��L, P&lt;0.05), and the ejection fraction was reduced (37.1±1.8% vs. 49.4±3.7%, P&lt;0.05) in DOCA mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both the whole cell and cytosolic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> level were increased (279±70% and 123±2% of sham, respectively, P&lt;0.01), I(Na) was decreased (60±10% of sham, P&lt;0.01), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ROS overproduction was observed (2.9±0.3-fold of sham, P&lt;0.01) in heart tissue and myocytes of myopathic mice vs. sham </plain></SENT>
