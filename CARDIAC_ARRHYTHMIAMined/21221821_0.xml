<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The interaction between moderate-to-severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> (OSA) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), is well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine whether atrial electromechanical parameters assessed by tissue Doppler imaging (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi>) would be affected in moderate-to-severe OSA, and detect the influential factors of atrial electromechanical parameters in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Interatrial and intra-atrial electromechanical delay was measured by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> in patients with moderate-to-severe OSA (n = 64) and control subjects (n = 39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>P-wave dispersion (PWD) was calculated on the 12-lead ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interatrial and intra-atrial electromechanical delay was significantly higher in the OSA group when compared with the controls (52.26 ± 12.9 vs 29.61 ± 11.26, P &lt; 0.0001 and 18.90 ± 8.13 vs 8.71 ± 5.46, P &lt; 0.0001; respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PWD was higher in the OSA group (46.09 ± 13.40 ms vs 34.10 ± 10.75 ms, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interatrial electromechanical delay had a positive correlation with PWD (r = 0.490, P &lt; 0.0001), left atrial (LA) diameter (r = 0.383, P = 0.002), LA volume index (r = 0.354, P = 0.004), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>-<z:mp ids='MP_0001956'>hypopnea</z:mp> index (r = 0.365, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, interatrial electromechanical delay was negatively correlated with the magnitude of the lowest oxygen saturation percentage (r = -0.498, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study showed that interatrial and intra-atrial electromechanical delay and PWD were prolonged in patients with moderate-to-severe OSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, hypoxemia, and the severity of the disease may contribute a prolongation in interatrial electromechanical delay via atrial structural and electrical alterations, which may predict the risk of future AF development in patients with moderate-to-severe OSA </plain></SENT>
