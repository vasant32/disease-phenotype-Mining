<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 398 patients at 32 centres who received an EnPulse dual-chamber pacing/dual-chamber adaptive rate pacing pacemaker (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The last amplitude thresholds as measured by ACM and VCM prior to the 6-month follow-up were compared with manually measured thresholds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Device diagnostics were used to evaluate ACM and VCM and the percentage of ventricular pacing with and without the AV extension algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Modelling was performed to assess longevity gains relating to the use of automaticity features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Atrial and ventricular capture management performed accurately and reliably provided complete capture management in 97% of studied patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The AV interval extension algorithm reduced the median per cent of right ventricular pacing in patients with sinus node dysfunction from 99.7 to 1.5% at 6-month follow-up and in patients with intermittent <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> (excluding persistent 3Â° <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp>) from 99.9 to 50.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the basis of validated modelling, estimated device longevity could potentially be extended by 1.9 years through the use of the capture management and AV interval extension features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Both ACM and VCM features reliably measured thresholds in nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients; the AV extension algorithm significantly reduced ventricular pacing; and the use of pacemaker automaticity features potentially extends device longevity </plain></SENT>
