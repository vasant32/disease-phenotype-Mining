<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Under X-ray fluoroscopy, 40-120 μm (16 mm(3) ) microemboli were delivered to embolize the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery of nine pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MDCT/MRI were performed at 72 h in a single session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microinfarcts were visible in six of nine animals on delayed contrast-enhanced MDCT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images but measurable in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals using semiautomated threshold methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other MDCT and MRI sequences demonstrated decline in left ventricular ejection fraction, regional strain and perfusion in visible and invisible microinfarcted regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microemboli caused significant elevation in cardiac injury enzymes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Various sizes of microinfarcts appeared microscopically as distinct aggregates of macrophages replacing myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Semiautomated threshold methods are necessary to measure and confirm/deny the presence of myocardial microinfarcts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study offers support for alternative applications of MDCT/MRI in assessing clinical cases in which microemboli &lt;120 μm escape protective devices during percutaneous coronary interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although microembolization resulted in no mortality, it caused left ventricular dysfunction, perfusion deficit, cellular damage increase in cardiac injury enzymes, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
