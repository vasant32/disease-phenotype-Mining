<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Voltage gated <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channels (Na(V)s) are essential to propagate neuronal and cardiac electrical impulses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While the cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> current (I(Na)) is often <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> attributed to the cardiac isoform, Na(V)1.5, some evidence suggests that other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channel isoforms are also expressed in the heart ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One way to distinguish <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channels is by their sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="9506">tetrodotoxin</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9506">TTX</z:chebi>); various "non-cardiac-type" <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channels are relatively sensitive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9506">TTX</z:chebi> (denoted tNa(V) channels) compared to Na(V)1.5 channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>tNa(V) channels have been detected in hearts with various pathological conditions such as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, infarction and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, where they might enhance the late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> current (I(NaL)) thereby prolonging the action potential under such conditions (resulting in a <z:mp ids='MP_0003233'>prolonged QT interval</z:mp> on the EKG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The principal aim of this article is to evaluate the extent to which non-cardiac isotypes contribute to I(NaL) under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> physiological conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>I(NaL) was measured in acutely dissociated dog cardiomyocytes using the patch-clamp technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that 44% on average of the late I(Na) current is due to non-cardiac Na(V)s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Previous studies indicated that the overexpression of non-cardiac Na(V) channels is responsible for the prolonged duration of the cardiac action potential (and, thereby, a <z:mp ids='MP_0003233'>prolonged QT interval</z:mp>) under pathophysiological conditions associated with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our finding indicates that non-cardiac Na(V) channels are strong contributors to I(NaL) under physiological conditions thereby suggesting that these channels are also major determinants of the duration of the cardiac action potential even in healthy hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, these results may explain the observations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0003233'>prolonged QT intervals</z:mp> in people with inherited neuronal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026857" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">musculoskeletal diseases</z:e> involving mutations that enhance the current from non-cardiac-type Na(V)s, a connection which apparently was never made before </plain></SENT>
