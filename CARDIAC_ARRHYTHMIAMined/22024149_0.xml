<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the long-term average TWA activity on Holter monitoring provides prognostic information in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four-hour Holter ECGs from 650 ambulatory patients with mild-to-moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> were analyzed in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Average TWA activity was measured by using a fully automated multilead technique, and 2 indices were proposed to quantify TWA: an index quantifying the average TWA activity in the whole recording (<z:mp ids='MP_0004157'>IAA</z:mp>), which was used to define a positive/negative TWA test, and an index quantifying the average TWA activity at heart rates between 80 and 90 beats/min (<z:mp ids='MP_0004157'>IAA</z:mp>(90)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients were divided into TWA positive (TWA+) and TWA negative (TWA-) groups by setting a cut point of 3.7 μV for <z:mp ids='MP_0004157'>IAA</z:mp>, corresponding to the 75th percentile of the distribution of <z:mp ids='MP_0004157'>IAA</z:mp> in the population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 48 months, the survival rate was significantly higher in the TWA- group for cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and SCD (p = .017 and p = .001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that both TWA+ and <z:mp ids='MP_0004157'>IAA</z:mp>(90) were associated with SCD with hazard rates of 2.29 (p = .004) and 1.07 per μV (p = .046), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The average TWA activity measured automatically from Holter ECGs predicted SCD in patients with mild-to-moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
