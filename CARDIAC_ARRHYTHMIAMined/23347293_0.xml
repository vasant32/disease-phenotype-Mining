<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The injection of cocaine in the penis has been predominantly recorded into the corpus cavernosae and is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0200023'>priapism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: Here we describe the injection of subcutaneous cocaine within the penile shaft skin producing ischemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and Fournier's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100758'>gangrene</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We sought to highlight the effects of cocaine use within the penis and emphasize the different effects that may ensue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed a recent clinical case and conducted a literature review on the use of cocaine within the penis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The use of cocaine has been reported previously within the literature and is mainly limited to case reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cocaine use within the corpora and the subcutaneous tissues produces significantly different consequences ranging from <z:hpo ids='HP_0200023'>priapism</z:hpo> to Fournier's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100758'>gangrene</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The case illustrates the growing use of cocaine and other illicit drugs and emphasizes the importance of this issue to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinicians </plain></SENT>
