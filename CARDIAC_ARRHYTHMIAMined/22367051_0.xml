<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate how <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) ablation has evolved over time with regards to patient characteristics, procedural variables, complications, and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated trends over time from 2003 to 2010 in clinical characteristics, procedural variables, complications, and Kaplan-Meier AF-free rates after the initial and final AF ablation in 1,125 patients undergoing 1,504 ablations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Evaluating trends from 2003 to 2010, we found that patients undergoing AF ablation became older (P &lt; 0.0001), had higher CHADS(2) scores (P &lt; 0.0001), and more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (P = 0.021), persistent AF (P &lt; 0.0001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.0001), and previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Procedure times decreased from 256 ± 49 to 122 ± 28 min (P &lt; 0.0005), fluoroscopy times decreased from 134 ± 29 to 56 ± 19 min (P &lt; 0.0005), and major (P = 0.023), minor (P = 0.023), and total complications (P = 0.001) decreased over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The learning curve to minimize complications was 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For paroxysmal AF, initial ablation AF-free rates improved over time (P = 0.015) but improvement plateaued in recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For persistent AF, initial ablation AF-free rates trended toward improvement over time (P = 0.062) but also plateaued in recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For long-standing persistent AF (P = 0.995), there was no outcome improvement after initial ablation over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no trend for improved final outcomes (including repeat ablations) over time for paroxysmal, persistent, or long-standing AF (P = 0.150 to P = 0.978) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite decreased procedural and fluoroscopy times and reduced complication rates, post-ablation freedom from AF has not improved commensurately in recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A better understanding of AF initiation and maintenance may be required to devise personalized approaches to AF ablation and further improve outcomes </plain></SENT>
