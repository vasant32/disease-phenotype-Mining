<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>Sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) in young people is a rare but devastating event for families and communities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ireland has previously had no measure of the incidence of SCD in young people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the incidence and causes of SCD in persons &lt;35 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We undertook a retrospective study of SCD between 2005 and 2007 in persons aged 15-35 years in the Republic of Ireland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified potential cases of out of hospital SCD through the Central Statistics Office (<z:chebi fb="97" ids="48272">CSO</z:chebi>) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificate records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Autopsy, toxicology, and inquest reports were then obtained and analysed by an expert panel who adjudicated on the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 342 potential SCD cases were identified through the <z:chebi fb="97" ids="48272">CSO</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty were younger than 15 years of age, and 86 had either incomplete or unavailable post-mortem reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 206 full reports obtained, 116 were adjudicated as cases of SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cases were predominantly male (75%), with a mean age of 25.8 years (standard deviation 6.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of SCD in this age range was 2.85 per 100,000 person-years (4.36 for males and 1.30 for females) and the incidence of sudden arrhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> syndrome (SADS) was 0.76 per 100,000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The commonest causes were SADS, 26.7% (31 of 116), followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, 20.7% (24 of 116), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM), 14.7% (17 of 116), and idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> not fulfilling criteria for HCM, 10.3% (12 of 116) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of SCD in the young in Ireland was 4.96 (95% CI 3.06, 6.4) for males and 1.3 (95% CI 0.62, 2.56) for females per 100 000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Sudden arrhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> syndrome was the commonest cause of SCD in the young, and the incidence of SADS was more than five times that in official reports of the Irish <z:chebi fb="97" ids="48272">CSO</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
