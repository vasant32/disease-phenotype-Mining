<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their functional role, however, remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used global Na(V)1.6-null mice to test the hypothesis that Na(V)1.6 contributes to the maintenance of propagation in the myocardium and to excitation-contraction (EC) coupling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated expression of transcripts encoding full-length Na(V)1.6 in isolated ventricular myocytes and confirmed the striated pattern of Na(V)1.6 fluorescence in myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the ECG, the PR and QRS intervals were prolonged in the null mice, and the Ca(2+) transients were longer in the null cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Under patch clamping, at holding potential (HP) = -120 mV, the peak I(Na) was similar in both phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, at HP = -70 mV, the peak I(Na) was smaller in the nulls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In optical mapping, at 4 mM [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>](o), 17 null hearts showed slight (7%) reduction of ventricular conduction velocity (CV) compared to 16 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 12 mM [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>](o), CV was 25% slower in a subset of 9 null vs. 9 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results highlight the importance of neuronal <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channels in the heart, whereby Na(V)1.6 participates in EC coupling, and represents an intrinsic depolarizing reserve that contributes to excitation </plain></SENT>
