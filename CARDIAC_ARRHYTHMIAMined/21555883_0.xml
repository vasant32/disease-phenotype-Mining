<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we wanted to replicate the prior association of two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in KCNJ5, C171T (rs6590357) and G810T (rs7118824), with lone AF in Han Chinese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We sequenced the coding region and splice site of KCNJ2, KCNJ3 and KCNJ5 in 187 early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> lone-AF patients screening for mutations and counting SNP frequencies for the two noted SNPs in KCNJ5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No mutations were found in KCNJ2, KCNJ3 or KCNJ5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both genotype distribution and allele frequencies of the SNPs rs6590357 and rs7118824 significantly differed between the AF and control group (p(genotype) = 0.0067, p(allele) = 0.0021 and p(genotype) = 0.014, p(allele) = 0.0101, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On allele level, the OR for lone AF for rs6590357 was 1.77 (95% CI 1.16-2.73, p = 0.009) and for rs7118824 it was 1.71 (95% CI 1.13-2.57, p = 0.01) in a model adjusted for age and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that rs6590357 and rs7118824 in KCNJ5 are associated with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> lone AF in Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No mutations were found in the exon or splice site of KCNJ2, KCNJ3 or KCNJ5 </plain></SENT>
