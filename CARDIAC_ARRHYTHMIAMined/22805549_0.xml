<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate electrocardiographic characteristics and effects of radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) for patients with symptomatic premature ventricular complexes (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>) and idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardias</z:hpo> (IVTs), originating from the different portions of the left coronary veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Inadequate distinction was made in the past for the <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp>/IVTs located in the different portions of the left coronary veins, especially the distal great cardiac vein (DGCV) and the proximal portion of the anterior interventricular vein (PAIV) and the extended tributary of DGCV located distal to the origin of AIV (EDGCV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Characteristics of body surface electrocardiogram (ECG) and electrophysiologic recordings were analyzed in 12 patients with symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>/IVTs originating from the vicinity of the left coronary veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 490 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>/IVTs, the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> originating from the left ventricular epicardium adjacent to the transitional area from the GCV to the AIV was 2.45% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four had <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>/IVTs from DGCV, 5 from PAIV, and 3 from EDGCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were different characteristics of ECG of <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>/VT originating from the DGCV and PAIV and EDGCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Successful RFCA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 12 patients could be achieved (100% <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> procedural success) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No complications were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During a median follow up of 17months (range 6-45months), 2 had recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> (recurrence rate: 16.67%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ECG characteristics of <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>/VTs originating from the different portions of the left coronary veins (DGCV and PAIV and EDGCV) are different, and can help regionalize the origin of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RFCA within the coronary venous system was relatively effective and safe for the <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>/IVTs and should be seen as an alternative approach, when the left-sided <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>/IVTs could not be eliminated by RFCA from the endocardium or aortic sinus of Valsalva </plain></SENT>
