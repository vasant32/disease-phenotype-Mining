<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">Magnesium</z:chebi> has been reported to be effective in reducing the incidence or prophylaxis of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">Magnesium</z:chebi> is also an essential constituent of many enzyme systems and plays a physiological role in coagulation regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi>, whether <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> infusion might decrease the incidence of AF and induce hypocoagulable state in patients with AF, who were undergoing mitral valve annuloplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This prospective laboratory study was performed using blood from patients with AF undergoing mitral valve annuloplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The radial artery was punctured with a 20 gauge catheter and used for monitoring continuous arterial pressure and blood sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After anesthesia induction, 4 g of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> was mixed with 100 ml <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline and infused for 5 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">Magnesium</z:chebi>, calcium, activated clotting time (ACT) and thromboelastographic parameters were checked before and 60 minutes after the <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The electrocardiography changes after <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> infusion were also checked before commencing cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> infusion, the serum level of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> increased significantly but serum calcium did not change significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ACT did not change significantly before or after <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The thromboelastographic parameters showed no significant changes before or after <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>None of the patients converted to sinus rhythm from AF after the <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> infusion did not influence the course of AF and coagulation in patients during prebypass period with AF undergoing mitral valve annuloplasty </plain></SENT>
