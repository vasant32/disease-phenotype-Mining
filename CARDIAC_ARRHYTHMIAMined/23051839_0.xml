<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several percutaneous circulatory support systems have been recently introduced into clinical practice for the treatment of cardiogenic shock or refractory nontolerated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, in support of high-risk catheter interventions and, occasionally, cardiopulmonary resuscitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, however, a direct comparison of the available systems has not been performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Adult female pigs (weight 50-60 kg) were used throughout the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Under deep anesthesia and mechanical ventilation, 3 percutaneous circulatory support systems were compared: (1) right atrium-aorta, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (n=4); (2) left atrium-aorta, TandemHeart system (n=4); (3) left ventricle-aorta, Impella 2.5 system (n=4), and (4) left ventricle-aorta with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> at 0.1 Âµg/kg per minute (n=4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic efficacy (mean arterial pressure) was measured at 3 specific conditions: ventricular pacing at 200 and 300 beats per minute, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although no or only nonsignificant differences were found among the systems at ventricular pacing of 200 and 300 beats per minute, under <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo>, the right atrium-aorta system was significantly the most efficacious, followed by the left atrium-aorta system and the left ventricle-aorta system (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the left ventricle-aorta system with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> still maintained mean arterial pressure comparable with the left atrium-aorta system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Differences were seen in the hemodynamic efficacy of available percutaneous circulatory support systems, particularly under the most severe hemodynamic condition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
