<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify independent preoperative predictors of outcome for total hip or knee replacement (THKR) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> (AAA) repair, including the importance of the time interval between an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome (ACS) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Present guidelines do not advocate a prolonged delay after ACS though recent data suggest delaying operations by 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is a lack of data on when to schedule surgery following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Hospital Episode Statistics database was analyzed for elective admissions for THKR and AAA surgery between 2006-2007 and 2009-2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient factors influencing mortality, length of stay, and readmission rates were identified by logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 414,985 THKRs (mortality: 0.2%) and 14,524 AAA repairs (mortality: 3.5%) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo>, and non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> increased the odds of mortality for both surgeries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among other factors, previous ACS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> predicted mortality after THKR but not AAA surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with more delayed surgery, THKR surgery performed within 6 months of an ACS (odds ratio [OR]: 3.81; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.55-9.34), but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, increased the odds of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effect of ACS persisted up to 12 months (OR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.02-3.88) and was not altered by exclusion of patients who received percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting for treatment of their ACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and ACS increased the odds of perioperative mortality from THKR but not AAA surgery; THKR surgery conducted up to 12 months after an ACS was associated with increased mortality </plain></SENT>
