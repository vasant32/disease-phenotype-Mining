<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Electromagnetic Navigation Bronchoscopy (ENB) (InReach iLogic system; superDimension Inc) is a relatively new discipline, with promising diagnostic and therapeutic applications in patients with lung lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Navigation is performed in a magnetic field and, therefore, has been considered relatively contraindicated in patients with pacemakers and automated implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (AICDs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Potential risks include altering the function and shutting off the device, device damage, lead displacement, and potential overheating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over the past decade, there has been extensive literature about the safety of pacemakers in either the 1.5-T or 3-T magnetic fields used in current MRI scanners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the magnetic field used in ENB is significantly weaker, 0.0001 T or approximately equal to the earth's gravity, its safety in patients with pacemakers is yet to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We present our initial experience with ENB in patients with cardiac implanted electrical devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four procedures in 24 patients with lung lesions and permanent pacemakers were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A cardiac electrophysiologist and programmer were present during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At baseline, the pacers were interrogated, and ECG was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Continuous cardiac monitoring was performed during the procedure, and at the end, the pacer settings and function were reinterrogated to check for any changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The procedures were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> successfully concluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the patients suffered any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> or disruption to their pacemakers' function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ENB appears to be safe when performed in patients with pacemakers and AICDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Larger multicenter studies are needed to prove the final safety in this patient population </plain></SENT>
