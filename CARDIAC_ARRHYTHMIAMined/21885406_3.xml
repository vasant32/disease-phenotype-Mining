<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Efforts to identify patients at risk, determine mechanisms of VT, and effectively prevent and treat VT through a mechanism-based approach would <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> be facilitated by continuous, noninvasive imaging of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> over the entire heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we present noninvasive real-time images of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> using electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results reveal diverse activation patterns, mechanisms, and sites of initiation of human VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The spatial resolution of ECGI is superior to that of the routinely used 12-lead electrocardiogram, which provides only global information, and ECGI has distinct advantages over the currently used method of mapping with invasive catheter-applied electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The spatial resolution of this method and its ability to image electrical activation sequences over the entire ventricular surfaces in a single heartbeat allowed us to determine VT initiation sites and continuation pathways, as well as VT relationships to ventricular substrates, including anatomical scars and abnormal electrophysiological substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, ECGI can map the VT activation sequence and identify the location and depth of VT origin in individual patients, allowing personalized treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
