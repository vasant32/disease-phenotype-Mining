<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In rabbit hearts, similar sex- and age-dependent TdP risks were attributed to higher expression levels of L-type Ca(2+) channels and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-Ca(2+) exchanger, at the base of the female epicardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, the effects of <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> are investigated to elucidate the mechanisms whereby I(Ca,L) density is upregulated in adult female rabbit hearts. I(Ca,L) density was measured by the whole-cell patch-clamp technique on days 0-3 in cardiomyocytes isolated from the base and apex of adult female epicardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peak I(Ca,L) was 28% higher at the base than apex (P &lt; 0.01) and decreased gradually (days 0-3), becoming similar to apex myocytes, which had stable currents for 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incubation with <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> (E2, 0.1-1.0 nm) increased I(Ca,L) (∼2-fold) in female base but not endo-, apex or male myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">Progesterone</z:chebi> (0.1-10 μm) had no effect at base myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> of the α- (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53257">PPT</z:chebi>, 5 nm) but not the β- (DPN, 5 nm) subtype <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> receptor (ERα/ERβ) upregulated I(Ca,L) like E2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Western blots detected similar levels of ERα and ERβ in male and female hearts at the base and apex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>E2 increased Cav1.2α (immunocytochemistry) and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (RT-PCR) levels but did not change I(Ca,L) kinetics. I(Ca,L) upregulation by E2 was suppressed by the ER <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> ICI 182,780 (10 μm) or by inhibition of transcription (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi>, 4 μm) or protein biosynthesis (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi>, 70 μm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, E2 upregulates I(Ca,L) by a regional genomic mechanism involving ERα which is a known determinant of sex differences in TdP risk in LQT2 </plain></SENT>
