<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An observational study was performed from January 2006 to August 2010; 1309 internal jugular vein cannulae were inserted in the operating room by either staff or resident anesthesiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient age, weight, sex, type of catheter (diameter, lumen number), number of attempts, and complications were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The discussion is focused on how to prevent or reduce internal jugular vein line insertion related complications in infants and children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 1309 IJV cannulae were inserted, 85.63% of catheters placed were successful after one to three attempts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complications included 12 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (0.91%), 25 arterial punctures (1.90%), 16 <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> (1.22%), 17 device occlusions, breaks or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_79'>malpositions</z:mpath> (1.29%), 11 line-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (0.84%), four cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> (0.31%), two cardiopulmonary arrests (0.15%), two hemothoraces (0.15%), five pneumothoraces (0.38%), and one guidewire winding (0.07%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The complication rates of resident anesthesiologists were significantly higher compared to staff anesthesiologists for both common and rare complications (4.27% versus 2.21%; 0.68% versus 0.07%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, residents' number of attempts were greater than staff anesthesiologists (1.84 and 1.38, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The IJV catheterization was feasible in infants and children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To reduce the risk of complications, the procedure should be performed or supervised by staff anesthesiologists; inserting the needle, guidewire, dilator, and the catheter too far should be avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is now commonly accepted that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> central venous cannulations should be performed under ultrasound guidance, especially in children </plain></SENT>
