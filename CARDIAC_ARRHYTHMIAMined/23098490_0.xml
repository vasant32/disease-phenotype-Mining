<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been reported recently that B7-H3 is highly expressed in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells, the data indicating that it may be a regulation factor contributing to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our study, we used bioinformatics to identify differentially expressed genes between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> cells and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic cells, aiming to analyze mechanisms and identify sub-pathways closely related to progression, with the final aim of finding small molecule drugs which might interfere this progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28462">ajmaline</z:chebi> is one related factor which may enhance self-immunity in colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> therapy and B7-H3 plays important roles with regard to immunoreactions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the results indicate that H7-B3 is a favorable prognostic biomarker for colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, providing novel information regarding likely targets for intervention </plain></SENT>
