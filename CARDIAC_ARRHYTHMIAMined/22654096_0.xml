<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-five patients with persistent AF of &lt;18 months duration needing cardioversion were recruited for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four patients were successfully cardioverted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 3 months 28/54 (51%) were in SR and at 12 months 21/53 (39%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, only exercise-induced change in NT-proANP and LAEI were found to be predictive of AFR up to 12 months post-cardioversion and had an effect on AF-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was elevated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> persistent AF patients but did not predict recurrent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Left atrial expansion index and exercise-induced atrial natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> change show promise as predictors of AFR after cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These predictors may identify patients at an early stage in their disease with intact neurohumoral feedback systems and less advanced atrial remodelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to confirm these findings </plain></SENT>
