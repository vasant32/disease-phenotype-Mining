<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Advantages over standard angioplasty and stent technologies include a homogeneous drug delivery to the vessel wall, an immediate drug release without the use of a polymer, the option of using balloon catheters alone or in combination with a bare metal stent, no foreign object left behind in the body, the potential of reducing anti-platelet therapy, and a lower restenosis rates in some indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical and angiographic presentation of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome (ACS) is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, different clinical scenarios of DCB application in ACS may be discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Frequently, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the ACS-related lesion plays a major role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in hemodynamic critical situations under <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> therapy may present with too small vessel diameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Another clinically relevant scenario represents in-stent restenosis (ISR) which is frequently associated with ACS </plain></SENT>
