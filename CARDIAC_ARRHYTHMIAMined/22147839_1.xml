<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anatomic studies found a high prevalence of GP in the posterior surface of the right atrium (RA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experimental data suggested the potential role of right atrial GP in the AF initiation and maintenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to assess the efficacy of GP ablation in RA in patients with vagal AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-four patients without structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart diseases</z:e> were randomly assigned for a selective ablation procedure targeted on the elimination of vagal reflex evoked by high frequency stimulation or an extensive approach at anatomic sites of GP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent Holter ECG and heart rate variability evaluation at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At a mean follow-up of 19.7Â±5.2 months, AF recurred in 5 of 17 patients with anatomic ablation and in 13 of 17 patients with a selective approach (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patient had major complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After ablation, heart rate variability parameters showed a significant parasympathetic (and sympathetic) denervation in the first 6 months, which was more prominent in patients with anatomic GP ablation and in those without AF recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that in a selected population of vagal paroxysmal AF, the anatomic ablation of GPs in the RA is effective in about 70% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results confirm that atrial vagal denervation can abolish AF, as suggested by experimental and clinical data </plain></SENT>
