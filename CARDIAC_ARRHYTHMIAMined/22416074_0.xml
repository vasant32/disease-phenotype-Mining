<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was followed by cardiac catheterization, which led to coronary angiography and to percutaneous coronary intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The coronary care units and early reperfusion reduced the early mortality owing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and the discovery of coronary risk factors led to the development of Preventive Cardiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other major advances include several cardiac imaging techniques, the birth and development of cardiac surgery, and the control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, although greatly improved, remains a challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Current cardiology practice is evidence-based and global in scope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Research and practice are increasingly conducted in cardiovascular centres and institutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is likely that in the future, a greater emphasis will be placed on prevention, which will be enhanced by genetic information </plain></SENT>
