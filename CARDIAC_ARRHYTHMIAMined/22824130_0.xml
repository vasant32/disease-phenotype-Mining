<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most common causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> are congenital electrical disorders and structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The majority of these diseases have an <z:hpo ids='HP_0003829'>incomplete penetrance</z:hpo> and variable expression; therefore, patients may be unaware of their illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In several cases, physical activity can be the trigger for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> as first symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our purpose is to review the causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> in sportive children and young adults and its genetic background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic individuals often receive an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, the preventive treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> in most of cases due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1720983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">channelopathies</z:e>, which can become a challenging option in young and active patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The identification of one of these diseases in asymptomatic patients has similarly a great impact on their everyday life, especially on their ability to undertake competitive physical activities, and the requirement of prophylactic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We review main causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> in relation to its genetics and diagnostic work-up </plain></SENT>
