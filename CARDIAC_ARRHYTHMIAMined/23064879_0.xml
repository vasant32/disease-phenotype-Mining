<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been extensively demonstrated that an elevated heart rate is a modifiable, independent risk factor for cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A high heart rate increases myocardial oxygen consumption and reduces diastolic perfusion time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It can also increase ventricular diastolic pressures and induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Critical care patients are prone to develop a stress induced cardiac impairment and consequently an increase in sympathetic tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This in turn increases heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this setting, however, heart rate lowering might be difficult because the effects of inotropic drugs could be hindered by heart rate reducing drugs like beta-blockers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ivabradine is a new selective <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of funny channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It lowers heart rate, reducing the diastolic depolarization slope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, ivabradine is not active on sympathetic pathways, thus avoiding any interference with inotropic <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the literature available regarding heart rate control in critical care patients, focusing our interest on the use of ivabradine to assess the potential benefits of the drug in this particular setting </plain></SENT>
