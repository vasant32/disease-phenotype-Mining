<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chemical structures of basic forms (labelled as 7a2C-7d2C) and appropriate monochlorides (labelled as 7a-7d) were confirmed by 1H-NMR, <z:chebi fb="18" ids="36928">13C</z:chebi>-NMR, MS and IR spectral and elemental analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The estimated physicochemical parameters included the melting point data, solubility profile in various media, purity checking (adsorption thin-layer chromatography), surface activity determination (Traube stalagmometric method), acidobasic characteristics (pKa value determination by alkalimetric titration) as well as the log epsilon values estimation by UV/VIS spectrophotometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other experimental values under consideration were lipohydrophilic characteristics using reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography (R(M) readouts) RP-HPLC (log k' data) and the log P(exp) s estimated in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16188">octan-1-ol</z:chebi>/phosphate buffer medium </plain></SENT>
