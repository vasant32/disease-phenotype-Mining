<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> may be corrected with the anxiolytic Adaptol in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: On the basis of the data of psychological and mental testing (Stroop test) and the results of Holter monitoring, the authors selected among 59 patients with non-coronarogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (VA) and an inadequate response to antiarrhythmic therapy 21 patients with manifest <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> disorders, in whom a psychogenic factor had played a significant role in the genesis of VA, which served as an indication for Adaptol use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reexaminations were made 30 days after initiation of therapy with Adaptol 500 mg t.i.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Adaptol used to treat VA in patients with high <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, unlike the controls, exerted a significant antiarrhythmic effect: the average daily and average hourly number of ventricular ectopic complexes significantly decreased while there were no changes in the control group (untreated with Adaptol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 95% of the patients, the positive Stroop mental test became negative, i.e. it failed to provoke <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (p &lt; or = 0.01), made test performance easy, and diminished a blood pressure response to the test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of patients with moderate and high situational <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> decreased by 3 times (p &lt; or = 0.01); the general condition improved in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The psychogenic factor plays a significant and sometimes determining role in the genesis of non-coronarogenic VA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When used alone and in combination with antiarrthythmics, Adaptol proved to be effective in treating non-coronarogenic VA in patients with higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
