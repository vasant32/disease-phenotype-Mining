<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main purpose of the present preclinical study was to investigate the possible role of euglycemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> in development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Euglycemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> was induced in conscious rabbits equipped with a right ventricular pacemaker electrode catheter by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp (HEGC) applying two different rates of insulin infusion (5 and 10 mIU/kg/min) and variable rate of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion to maintain euglycemia (5.5 ± 0.5 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> on cardiac electrophysiological parameters was continuously monitored by means of 12-lead surface ECG recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> incidence was determined by means of programmed electrical stimulation (PES) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The possible role of adrenergic activation was investigated by determination of plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> levels and intravenous administration of a beta adrenergic blocking agent, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the measurements were performed during the steady-state period of HEGC and subsequent to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both 5 and 10 mIU/kg/min insulin infusion prolonged significantly QTend, QTc, and Tpeak-Tend intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> generated by PES was increased significantly by euglycemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and exhibited linear relationship to plasma levels of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No alteration on plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> levels could be observed; however, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> treatment restored the prolonged QTend, QTc, and Tpeak-Tend intervals and significantly reduced the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo>-induced increase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Euglycemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> can exert proarrhythmic effect presumably due to the enhancement of transmural dispersion of repolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">Metoprolol</z:chebi> treatment may be of benefit in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> associated with increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
