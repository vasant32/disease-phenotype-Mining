<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with repaired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> may develop symptomatic and haemodynamic deterioration for many reasons such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0006048'>pulmonary regurgitation</z:mp>, and impairment in ventricular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a consecutive group of patients whose main clinical problem was atrial tachyarrhythmias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To describe the clinical outcome of atrial tachyarrhythmias occurring late after surgical repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo>; to define the circuits/foci responsible for these atrial tachyarrhythmias; to evaluate the outcome of computer-assisted mapping and catheter ablation in this patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive patients with surgically repaired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> and atrial tachyarrhythmias, who underwent catheter ablation between January, 2001 and June, 2007, were identified retrospectively from case records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Computer-assisted mapping was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> using either EnSite® (St Jude Medical Inc.) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> mapping and intra-cardiac catheter guidance system or CARTO™ (Biosense Webster Inc.) electroanatomical mapping systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (four males) with a median age of 39 plus or minus 8 years were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total number of atrial tachyarrhythmias identified was 22 (six macro-reentrant, 16 micro-reentrant/focal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In nine patients, catheter ablation led to improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> episodes and/or symptoms during follow-up of 41 plus or minus 20 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following ablation(s), five patients required pacing for pre-existing conduction disease and five needed further surgery for haemodynamic indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients remained on anti-arrhythmic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with surgically repaired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> and atrial tachyarrhythmias typically have multiple arrhythmic circuits/foci arising from a scarred right atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Catheter ablation reduces <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> frequency and improves symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, hybrid management is often required, comprising drugs, pacing, and further surgery tailored to the individual </plain></SENT>
