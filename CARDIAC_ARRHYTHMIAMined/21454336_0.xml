<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: A growing number of patients with implanted rhythm devices require new or additional leads, e.g. in cases of electrode defect or planned device upgrade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>If the ipsilateral subclavian vein is occluded, transvenous electrode placement from the contralateral side with subcutaneous, pre-sternal lead tunnelling (TUN) is one potential option that has been described in anecdotal reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and long-term feasibility of this approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified 18 subjects (67% male, 66±14 years) who underwent TUN at our institution between the years 1995 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Implantation protocols and patient files were reviewed for peri-operative complications and long-term lead performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients were interviewed for symptoms related to the tunnelled lead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty transvenous leads (seven implantable cardioverter defibrillator leads; five left ventricular, four right ventricular, four right atrial pace/sense electrodes) were successfully tunnelled without significant peri-operative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The follow-up duration was 29±36 (3-162) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Electrical parameters remained stable in 95% (19/20) of the tunnelled leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one right ventricle pace/sense lead, ventricular oversensing was documented 10 months after TUN, and the lead was replaced because a structural defect could not be excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five patients died without causal relationship to the procedure 4-48 months after TUN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient reported discomfort related to the tunnelled lead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Contralateral transvenous lead implantation with subcutaneous, pre-sternal TUN appears to be a feasible option in selected patients with an implanted rhythm device and ipsilateral subclavian vein occlusion </plain></SENT>
