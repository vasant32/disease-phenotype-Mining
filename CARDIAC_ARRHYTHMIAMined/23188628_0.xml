<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An area of current interest is cardiac autonomic innervation imaging with a radiotracer such as (123)I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine ((123)I-mIBG), a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> analogue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardiac (123)I-mIBG uptake can be assessed by planar and SPECT techniques, involving determination of global uptake by a heart-to-mediastinal ratio, tracer washout between early and delayed images, and focal defects on tomographic images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiac (123)I-mIBG findings have consistently been shown to correlate strongly with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> severity, pre-disposition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and poor prognosis independent of conventional clinical, laboratory, and image parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(123)I-mIBG imaging promises to help monitor a patient's clinical course and response to therapy, showing potential to help select patients for an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> and other advanced therapies better than current methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Autonomic imaging also appears to help diagnose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> and identify higher risk, as well as risk-stratify patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although more investigations in larger populations are needed to strengthen prior findings and influence modifications of clinical guidelines, cardiac (123)I-mIBG imaging shows promise as an emerging technique for recognizing and following potentially life-threatening conditions, as well as improving our understanding of the pathophysiology of various diseases </plain></SENT>
