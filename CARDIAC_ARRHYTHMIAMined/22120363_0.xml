<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Survival after a gunshot wound (GSW) to the head is becoming more common, with an accompanying increase in spontaneous migration of these intracranial bullet fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon is well described in current literature and is a potentially life-threatening delayed complication of GSW to the head </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We present the case of a 17-year-old boy who survived a penetrating GSW to the cranium and cerebellum after an accident involving an AK (Automatic Kalashnikov)-47 (7.62 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Following initial attempts to remove the bullet and associated <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> from the cerebellar hemisphere, intraoperative fluoroscopy revealed that the bullet had migrated to lie within the right middle cerebellar peduncle with the development of intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The bullet could not be retrieved without risk of damage to the superior and inferior cerebellar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient then developed <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, and further imaging revealed the bullet had again migrated under the cerebellar cortex to an accessible location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was treated with aggressive antibiotic therapy and the bullet was removed from the posterior fossa, thus preventing recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and further migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient regained full motor, speech, and proprioceptive function within months after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The potential for spontaneous migration exists with any penetrating brain injury involving a retained foreign body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When a retained intracranial foreign body is unable to be safely extracted during initial debridement, close clinical evaluation is essential and plain-film or computed tomographic imaging should be considered in order to enhance the early detection of delayed-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> life-threatening deterioration, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> and occlusion of cerebrospinal fluid drainage, because of spontaneous migration </plain></SENT>
