<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MA intoxication can cause life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo>, renal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>liver failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and neurological damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the relationship between the underlying mechanism of such intoxication and metabolic networks, mass spectrometry-based metabolomics experiments were performed on Sprague-Dawley rats treated with MA at 10mgkg(-1)h(-1) for 4h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a combination of gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry and capillary electrophoresis-tandem mass spectrometry, global and targeted analyses were performed on biological samples collected during 0-24 and 72-96h (for urine), and at 24 and 96h (for plasma) after the last drug administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Body temperature and plasma biochemical parameters were also measured to detect abnormal reactions in neuronal and other several tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16010">5-Oxoproline</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16002">saccharic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37054">3-hydroxybutyrate</z:chebi> (3-HB), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30832">adipic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 6-phosphate, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> 1,6-bisphosphate, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27093">tricarboxylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi>) cycle intermediates, such as fumarate, were proposed as potential biomarkers related to MA-induced intoxications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In particular, the observation of decreased <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> cycle intermediates and 3-HB and increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> suggested that high doses of MA inhibit biogenic energy production by glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation via the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> cycle, and the beta-oxidation of fatty acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results may provide not only a clue to clarify the underlying mechanism of diverse intoxication effects, but also biological fluid-based diagnostic and forensic methods with which to objectively demonstrate intoxication without directly determining the drug </plain></SENT>
