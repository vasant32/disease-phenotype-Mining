<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Exposure to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> interpersonal violence (IPV) has been associated with psychiatric impairment; however, few studies have investigated attention processes and psychophysiology in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We investigated self-report and physiological correlates of attention biases in 27 IPV-exposed women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Participants completed self-report measures of trauma history, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038436" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="PTSD">posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</z:e> symptoms, and dissociation; were monitored physiologically during baseline; and responded to an emotional dot probe task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants showed bias away from positive and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> words, and toward IPV words </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lower baseline respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA) and higher skin conductance levels were associated with bias away from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> cues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Greater total <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTSD</z:e> symptoms were associated with bias toward IPV cues, and greater <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTSD</z:e> intrusion and avoidance symptoms were associated with lower RSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Individuals exposed to more types of trauma had lower heart rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data extend the research on emotion-cognition interactions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTSD</z:e> and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> disorders to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> IPV survivors, in part confirming avoidance and intrusion symptom and attention bias relations found in studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present work also draws attention to a group that tends to experience a range of severe symptoms associated with apparent blunting in autonomic activity, and suggests that self-report may not be sensitive to physiological and attention alterations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> IPV samples </plain></SENT>
