<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Risk markers and predictors of HAVB occurring after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the predictive value of risk markers derived from a series of non-invasive and invasive tests for the development of HAVB documented by an implantable loop recorder (ILR) in late convalescent phases of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The study included 292 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> and subsequent left ventricular dysfunction without prior HAVB or implanted pacemaker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An ILR was implanted for continuous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk stratification testing was performed at inclusion and 6 weeks after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The tests included echocardiography, electrocardiogram (ECG), 24 h Holter monitoring, and an invasive electrophysiological study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High-degree <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> was documented in 28 (10%) patients during a median follow-up of 2.0 (0.4-2.0) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Heart rate variability (HRV) measures and non-sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> occurring at the week 6 Holter monitoring were highly predictive of HAVB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Power law slope &lt;-1.5 ms(2)/Hz was the most powerful HRV parameter (HR = 6.02 [2.08-17.41], P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Late HAVB development in post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> patients with left ventricular dysfunction can be predicted by risk stratification tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Measures of HRV reflecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> revealed the highest predictive capabilities </plain></SENT>
