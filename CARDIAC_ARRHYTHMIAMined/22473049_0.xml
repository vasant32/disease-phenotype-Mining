<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We are reporting a case of an elderly male who presented with symptoms of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and was later found to have developed factor V inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He had been on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and developed hemorrhagic manifestations due to factor V inhibitors within a few months of initiating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most of the cases of factor V inhibitors reported in the literature were found to be associated with exposure to bovine coagulation factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in our case there was no evidence of bovine thrombin use during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, bovine thrombin-associated factor V inhibitors commonly emerge within 1-2 weeks after exposure during surgery versus several months later in our patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was dramatic improvement in the coagulation profile 6 weeks after discontinuation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> and institution of steroids and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We propose the consideration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> as a contributing agent in inhibitor generation even though a spontaneous development of factor V inhibitor could not be ruled out </plain></SENT>
