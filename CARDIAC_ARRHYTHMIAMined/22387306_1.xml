<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic cardiac pacing may be considered in asymptomatic patients with FAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the potential benefits are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To document <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conduction disorders</z:e> in a large series of FAP and the incidence of high-degree atrioventricular (AV) block in patients with prophylactic pacemaker (PM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 1999 to January 2010, 262 patients with FAP were retrospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic PM was implanted in patients with His-ventricular interval ≥ 70 ms, His-ventricular interval &gt;55 ms associated with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015643" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fascicular block</z:e>, a first-degree <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp>, or a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264907" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wenckebach</z:e> anterograde point ≤ 100 beats/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The spontaneous AV conduction was then analyzed by temporarily inhibiting the PM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As compared with patients with prophylactic PM (n = 100) and patients implanted given a class I/IIa indication (n = 18), the patients who did not require PM (n = 144) were younger and displayed less severe cardiac involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up after prophylactic PM implantation was analyzed in 95 of the 100 patients over 45 ± 35 months, and a high-degree <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> was documented in 24 of the 95 patients (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk of high-degree <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> was higher in patients with first-degree <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264907" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wenckebach</z:e> anterograde point ≤ 100 beats/min (hazard ratio 3.5; 95% confidence interval 1.2-10) while microvoltage on surface electrocardiogram reduced the risk (hazard ratio 0.2; 95% confidence interval 0.1-0.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In FAP with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conduction disorders</z:e>, prophylactic PM implantation prevented major cardiac events in 25% of the patients over a 45-month mean follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that prophylactic PM implantation prevented symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> in these patients </plain></SENT>
