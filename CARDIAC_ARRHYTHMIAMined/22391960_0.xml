<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Low <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> remains a problem in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to ascertain the incidence and clinical predictors of low <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> and the treatment strategies for low <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> or CRTD recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Selected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> or CRTD recipients from January 2006 to May 2008 who underwent <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> test at the time of implantation were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Low <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> patients were defined as patients who had a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> within 10 J of the maximum delivered energy of the device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These patients were compared to patients who had <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> &gt; 10 J </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This study included 243 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, 13 (5.3%) patients had low <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>, and 230 patients had adequate <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with low <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> had a high prevalence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> use (69% vs 13%, p &lt; 0.01), secondary prevention indications (69% vs 30%, p &lt; 0.01), and a trend toward younger age (51 ± 18 vs 58 ± 15 years, p = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age and sex, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> use was significantly associated with low <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> low <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> patients except one obtained adequate <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> after taking additional steps, including discontinuing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> and starting sotalol, RV lead repositioning, adding a subcutaneous array or shock coil, changing single-coil to dual-coil lead, and upgrading to a high output device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The incidence of low <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> patients is low with high-energy devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">Amiodarone</z:chebi> use is associated with low <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>, and its discontinuation or substitution with sotalol is one of a variety of available options for low <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
