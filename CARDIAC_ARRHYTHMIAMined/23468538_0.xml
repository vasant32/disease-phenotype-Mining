<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a phase I pilot study to assess the feasibility and safety of performing intravascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> after definitive intra-arterial reperfusion therapy (IAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ReCCLAIM (Reperfusion and Cooling in Cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e>) is a prospective single-arm open-label clinical trial conducted between May and August 2012 at Grady Memorial Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients with Alberta <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) 5-7 and NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score &gt; 13 were enrolled and treated with intravascular cooling immediately after IAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> was documented for the entire length of stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes included blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) breakdown on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-enhanced MRIs and 90-day modified Rankin scores (mRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age, median NIHSS score and median final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were 59.7±14.6 years, 19 (IQR16-22) and 78 cm(3) (IQR 16-107), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average time to the target temperature (33°C) was 64±50 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>Intracranial hemorrhages</z:hpo> were found in three patients, of which one was symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Evidence of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> breakdown was observed on 3 of 14 MRIs (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six patients died due to withdrawal of care, whereas six patients (30%) achieved mRS of 0-2 at 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In a binary logistical regression model comparing ReCCLAIM patients with 68 historical controls at our institution, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> was protective against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.56; p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>Hypothermia</z:hpo> can be safely performed after definitive IAT in patients with large pretreatment core <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A phase II study randomizing patients to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> or normothermia is needed to properly assess the efficacy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> as a neuroprotectant for reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
