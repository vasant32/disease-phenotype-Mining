<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Investigators sought to (1) determine the baseline performance characteristics of an Emergency Department (ED) telemetry system implementation at detecting simulated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and (2) improve system performance through HFE-based intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The prospective study was conducted in a regional referral ED over three 2-week periods from 2010 to 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were clinical providers working at the time of unannounced simulation sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three-minute episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001688'>sinus bradycardia</z:hpo> (SB) and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) were simulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An experimental HFE-based multi-element intervention was developed to (1) improve system accessibility, (2) increase system relevance and utility for ED clinical practice and (3) establish organisational processes for system maintenance and user base cultivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome variable was overall simulated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pre-intervention system characterisation, post-intervention end-user feedback and real-world correlates of system performance were secondary outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline HFE assessment revealed limited accessibility, suboptimal usability, poor utility and general neglect of the telemetry system; one simulated VT episode (5%) was detected during 20 pre-intervention sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Systems testing during intervention implementation recorded detection of 4 out of 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> simulations (p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty post-intervention sessions revealed more VT detections (8 of 10) than SB detections (3 of 10) for a 55% overall simulated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> detection rate (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Experimental investigations helped reveal and mitigate weaknesses in an ED clinical telemetry system implementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In situ simulation and HFE methodologies can facilitate the assessment and abatement of patient safety hazards in healthcare environments </plain></SENT>
