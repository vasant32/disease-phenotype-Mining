<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Her ECG showed short QT/QTc interval and peaked T wave </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Activation-recovery intervals (ARIs) were calculated from the intracardiac endocardial and epicardial electrode catheters placed in the left ventricle (LV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intravenous administration of nifekalant prolonged effective refractory period at multiple ventricular sites as well as the QT/QTc interval (from 260/300 to 364/419 ms) on the surface ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nifekalant also enlarged the transmural ARI dispersion of the ventricular repolarization, which was measured by the difference between the longest endocardial ARI and the shortest epicardial ARI during atrial pacing at 90 bpm, from 73 to 103-105 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These values corresponded to the intervals between the peak and end of the T wave on the surface ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nifekalant-induced QT interval prolongation on the surface ECG may not indicate attenuation of the arrhythmogenic potential in the heart of SQTS patients </plain></SENT>
