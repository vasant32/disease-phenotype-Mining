<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In 2007, great concern arose regarding failure of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) leads from several manufacturers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Of this analysis was to evaluate the incidence and predictors of Sprint Fidelis lead failure in order to find the best clinical strategy to prevent lead-related adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four hundred fourteen patients (357 male, 67 ± 12 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> equipped with right ventricular Sprint Fidelis leads were followed up in our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 35 months (25th-75th percentile = 27-47 months) and a total follow-up of 1,231 patient-years, lead failures occurred in 40 of 414 (9.7%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The annual rate was 3.2% per patient-year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five (87.5%) failures were caused by pacing-sensing connector fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk of lead fracture was higher in patients younger than 70 years (odds ratio = 2.31; 95% confidence interval = 1.14-4.68, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 30 patients with pacing-sensing conductor failure and available device diagnostics for failure alerting, the diagnostic parameter which first responded to lead failure was the sensing integrity counter in 15 of 30 (50%), pacing impedance in 12 of 30 (40%), and non-sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> in 3 of 30 (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median time (25th-75th percentile) between diagnostics alert and lead failure-related adverse events or failure acknowledgment was 2.2 (0.3-13.0) days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients suffered inappropriate shocks due to lead failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 50% of patients, daily monitoring by device diagnostics would have alerted physicians to impending lead failure at least 1 day in advance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Automatic algorithms based on device diagnostics may detect impending lead failure in nearly 50% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Remote monitoring may prevent failure-related adverse events </plain></SENT>
