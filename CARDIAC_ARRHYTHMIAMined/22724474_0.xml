<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Some early trials comparing intensive <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control in type 2 diabetics with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) reported a decrease in mortality over a short period of follow up leading to a presumption of improved survival with intensive <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Later data refuted this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 2009 ACC/AHA focused update on ST elevation MI gave a weak recommendation for the use of an insulin based regimen to achieve and maintain blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> less than 180 mg/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We decided to assess the validity of this recommendation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors searched the Pub- Med, Cochrane CENTRAL and EMBASE databases for randomized controlled trials from 1965 through 2011.Trials included were direct head-to-head comparisons of an intensive blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control strategy using pharmacological means (insulin in most cases) with a less intensive regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome assessed was the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> -cause mortality in the two groups at the end of follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also assessed was the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The methodological quality of the studies was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Event rates were compared using a forest plot of relative risk (RR; 95% confidence interval [CI]) using a random effects model (Mantel-Haenszel) assuming inter-study <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was done with Review Manager V5.1 and SYSTAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Meta-regression was done with duration of therapy as covariate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three studies (total N = 2113) met the inclusion exclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mortality was not different between the groups (RR 0.94, 95% CI of 0.66-1.34; p=0.73.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was significantly higher in the intensive <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control group (RR 13.40, 95% CI 3.69-48.61; p &lt; 0.01), with a 12% absolute risk increase and a number needed to harm (NNH) of 9 (95% CI 6.8- 9.8)-even without achieving target glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Neither did intensive control improve <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and reinfarction rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Meta regression revealed that mortality with intensive glycemic control was worse with increased duration of therapy (p=0.001, for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review suggests limited benefit of intensive glycemic control in type 2 diabetics with an MI, with a significant risk of serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
