<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lossy thresholding-based compressors have shown good performance needing low computational resources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this work, two compression schemes that include nearly perfect reconstruction cosine modulated filter banks for the signal decomposition are proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They are evaluated for highly reliable applications, where the reconstructed signal must be very similar to the original </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results show that the proposed compressors yield better performance than discrete wavelet transform-based techniques, when high quality requirements are imposed </plain></SENT>
