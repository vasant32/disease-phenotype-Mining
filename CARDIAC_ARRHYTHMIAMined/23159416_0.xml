<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cardiac ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channels have been suggested to contribute to the adaptive physiological response to metabolic challenge after β-adrenoceptor stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, an increased atrial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>-conductance might be expected to be proarrhythmic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channel blockade on the electrophysiological responses to β-adrenoceptor-induced metabolic challenge in intact atria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Atrial electrograms were recorded from the left atrial epicardial surface of Langendorff-perfused rat hearts using a 5×5 electrode array </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Atrial effective refractory period and conduction velocity were measured using an S(1)-S(2) protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportion of hearts in which atrial tachyarrhythmia was produced by burst-pacing was used as an index of atrial tachyarrhythmia-inducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Atrial nucleotide concentrations were measured by high performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Perfusion with ≥10(-9) mol/L of the β-adrenoceptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> (ISO), resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction of atrial effective refractory period and conduction velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ISO-induced changes produced a proarrhythmic substrate such that atrial tachyarrhythmia could be induced by burst-pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Atrial [ATP] was significantly reduced by ISO (10(-6) mol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Perfusion with either of the ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channel blockers, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> (10(-5) mol/L) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi> (10(-3) mol/L), in the absence of ISO had no effect on basal atrial electrophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the proarrhythmic substrate induced by 10(-6) mol/L ISO was abolished by either of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi>, which prevented induction of atrial tachyarrhythmia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Atrial ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channels activate in response to β-adrenergic metabolic stress in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts, resulting in a proarrhythmic substrate </plain></SENT>
