<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In patients with low ejection fraction and ventricular dyssynchrony, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an accepted therapeutic modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In these patients, CRT can improve the quality of life and exercise tolerance in addition to improved survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, antiarrhythmic effects of CRT is a place of debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: In this study, we evaluated the effect of CRT-induced reverse remodeling on <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with CRT were divided to two groups of responders and nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Responders were those with reduction of LVESD of more than 10% or increase in LVEF of more than 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They were visited and device analysis was performed during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and nineteen patients were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Those with reverse remodeling experienced fewer <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> after two years of follow-up (N = 2 vs 11, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Reverse remodeling associated with CRT implantation can result in decreased frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
