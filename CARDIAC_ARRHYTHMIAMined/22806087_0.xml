<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Negative intrathoracic pressure, as occurring during OSA, may provoke cardiac dysrhythmias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we aimed to study the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> effects of simulated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001956'>hypopnea</z:mp> on arrhythmic potential and measures of cardiac repolarization [QT(C) and T (peak) to T (end) intervals [TpTec]) in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 41 healthy volunteers, ECG was continuously recorded prior, during and after simulated obstructive <z:mp ids='MP_0001956'>hypopnea</z:mp> (inspiration through a threshold load), simulated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> (Mueller maneuver), end-expiratory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002871'>central apnea</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> breathing in randomized order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of subjects with premature beats was significantly higher during inspiration through a threshold load (n = 7), and the Mueller maneuver (n = 7) compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> breathing (n = 0) (p = 0.008 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons), but not during end-expiratory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002871'>central apnea</z:hpo> (n = 3, p = 0.125) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inspiration through a threshold load was associated with a non-significant mean (SD) increase of the QT(C) interval [+5.4 (22.4) ms, 95 %CI -1.7 to +12.4 ms, p = 0.168] and a significant increase of the TpTcc interval [+3.7 (8.9) ms, 95 %CI +0.9 to +6.6 ms, p = 0.010] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Mueller maneuver induced a significant increase of the QT(C) interval [+8.3 (23.4) ms, 95 %CI 0.9 to +15.6 ms, p = 0.035] and the TpTec interval (+4.2 (8.2) ms, 95 %CI +1.6 to +6.8 ms, p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant changes of the QT(C) and TpTec intervals during central end-expiratory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that simulated obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001956'>hypopnea</z:mp> are associated with an increase of premature beats and prolongation of QT(C) and TpTec intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, negative intrathoracic pressure changes may be a contributory mechanism for the association between OSA and cardiac dysrhythmias </plain></SENT>
