<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the association between improvements in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and self-reported adherence to health behaviors in depressed cardiac patients in the 6 months after cardiac hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed from depressed patients on inpatient cardiac units who were hospitalized for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and enrolled in a randomized trial of collaborative care <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> management (n = 134 in primary analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measurements of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> (Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> subscale), and adherence to secondary prevention behaviors (Medical Outcomes Study-Specific Adherence Scale items) were obtained at baseline, 6 weeks 12 weeks, and 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association between improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and adherence was assessed by linear regression after accounting for the effects of multiple relevant covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points improvement in the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 was significantly and independently associated with self-reported adherence to medications and secondary prevention behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, improvement in the Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> subscale was associated with improved adherence only at 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in a cohort of depressed cardiac patients, improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was consistently and independently associated with superior self-reported adherence to medications and secondary prevention behaviors across a 6-month span, whereas improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> was not </plain></SENT>
