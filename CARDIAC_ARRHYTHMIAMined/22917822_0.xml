<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of this drug for cases of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with left ventricular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between September 2006 and August 2009, 32 patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of &lt;40% underwent CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two groups of patients, a group administered landiolol <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> and a control group not administered this drug, were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The administration of landiolol <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> was initiated at 1 μg/kg per minute (γ) after cardiopulmonary bypass in on-pump cases and after completion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the distal anastomoses in off-pump cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed no significant differences between the groups with respect to preoperative patient background or incidences of complications, except for postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The heart rate decreased significantly 30 minutes after landiolol <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> administration, but no change was observed in arterial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No change was observed in other parameters; the hemodynamics were stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> during the intensive care unit stay (during landiolol <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> administration) was significantly lower in the administration group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The difference remained significant after multiple logistic regression analysis; landiolol <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> was the sole inhibitory factor </plain></SENT>
