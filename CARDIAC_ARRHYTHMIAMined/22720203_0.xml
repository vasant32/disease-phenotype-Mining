<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The adverse prognosis of untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> diagnosed in childhood is well studied and percutaneous device closure of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASDs</z:e> has evolved to become the standard of care in both pediatric and young adult populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is a growing body of literature that suggests the benefits of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> closure are not restricted to younger populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In older adults, there are beneficial effects on cardiac chamber geometry, pulmonary artery pressures, patient symptoms and exercise capacity with closure of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>, and these salutary effects appear to be more pronounced the earlier the defect is closed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The weight of evidence suggests that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> should be closed percutaneously earlier rather than later, and consideration should be given to percutaneous device closure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> in adults upon diagnosis, rather than waiting for symptoms or cardiac chamber <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
