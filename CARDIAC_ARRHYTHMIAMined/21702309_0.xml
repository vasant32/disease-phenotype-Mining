<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: It is well known that accelerations during centrifuge training and during flight can provoke <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our study was designed to investigate both the similarities and differences between heart rhythm disturbances during flights and centrifuge tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: There were 40 asymptomatic, healthy pilots who performed two training flights and were also tested in a human centrifuge according to a program of rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> rate acceleration (ROR) and of centrifuge simulation of the actual acceleration experienced in flight (Simulation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the flight and centrifuge tests ECG was monitored with the Holter method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ECG was examined for heart rhythm changes and disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During flights, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>) were found in 25% of the subjects, premature supraventricular contractions (PSVCs) and <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> with bigeminy in 5%, and pairs of <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> in 2.5% of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the centrifuge tests, <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> were experienced by 45% of the subjects, PSVCs and pairs of <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> by 7.5%, and <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> with bigeminy by 2.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001688'>Sinus bradycardia</z:hpo> was observed during flights and centrifuge tests in 7.5% of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Comparative evaluation of electrocardiographic records in military pilots during flights and centrifuge tests demonstrated that: 1) there were no clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> recorded; and 2) the frequency and kind of heart rhythm disturbances during aerobatic flight and its simulation on a centrifuge were not identical and did not occur repetitively in the same persons during equal phases of the tests </plain></SENT>
