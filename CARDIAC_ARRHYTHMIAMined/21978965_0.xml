<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e>) remain the treatment of choice for the prevention of life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, many patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> require additional antiarrhythmic therapy to reduce the morbidity associated with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-triggered <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of celivarone in reducing these interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 153 eligible <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> recipients were randomized to receive either placebo or celivarone 100 or 300 mg once daily for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-triggered <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fewer <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> episodes were observed in the 300-mg celivarone group than in the placebo group, with a relative risk reduction of 46%, which was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause shocks showed a trend toward a decreased number of events in the celivarone 300-mg group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A post hoc analysis of the primary end point in a subgroup of patients in the celivarone 300-mg group, who had received <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy within 1 month of randomization, showed a significant benefit (P = .032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Celivarone was not associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsades de pointes</z:hpo>, thyroid dysfunction, or pulmonary events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> events were reported in the celivarone groups than in the placebo group, but the difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Celivarone tends to reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>-/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo>-triggered <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This effect was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a trend toward greater efficacy in the 300-mg group, especially in patients undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy within 30 days prior to randomization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Overall, celivarone was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
