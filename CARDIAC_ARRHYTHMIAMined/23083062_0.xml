<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Postmortem coronary angiography and microscopic examination were performed in 50 heroin addicts (group A) and in 50 nonaddicts (group B), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> male 16-40 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In group A, fatty and/or fibrous tissue replaced the AV node in 50% of cases while in group B in 14% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main bundle was replaced by fatty and/or fibrous tissue in 44% in group A cases and 10% in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intimal proliferation and fibromuscular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> of the AV arteries in group A were correspondingly 26% and 14% and in group B 6% and 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammation</z:mp> with focal and/or diffuse concentration of round cells of the AV node was detected in 54% in group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings could explain a possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> mechanism in this population </plain></SENT>
