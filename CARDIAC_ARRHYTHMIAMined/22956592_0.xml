<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Complex fractionated electrograms (CFEs) and high-dominant-frequency (DF) sites theoretically represent abnormal substrates and targets for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the high-DF sites in the left atrium (LA) and commonly used linear ablation line to the distribution of the CFEs in patients with persistent AF is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: This study enrolled 62 persistent AF patients who underwent construction of LA CFE and DF maps (&gt;350 points/map) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Circumferential pulmonary vein isolation and linear ablation including that at the septum, roof, mitral-annulus, and ridge of the appendage were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multipolar catheter mapping identified sites with high DFs (≥ 8 Hz) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (9.8 ± 4.6/patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 47 patients in whom AF persisted despite ablation, there was a significant reduction in the continuous CFE (&lt;50 ms) burden after the linear ablation (62 vs.11%; P &lt; 0.0001), with a decrease in both the DF within the coronary sinus (6.9 ± 0.9 vs. 5.9 ± 0.8 Hz; P &lt; 0.0001) and CFE surface area (42.8 ± 18.8 vs. 12.6 ± 10.5 cm(2); P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparing the high-DF sites with the ablated lesions, 64% of the high-DF sites (324 of 507) were on or adjacent to the ablation lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Residual CFEs were observed in the infero-posterior regions in 83% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Almost half of the high-DF sites away from the linear ablation line were identified in the inferior (34%) and posterior (14%) LA regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Linear ablation resulted in the localization of the continuous CFE regions and reduced the global LA DF in patients with persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This may be related to the proximity relationship between the linear ablation lines and high-DF sites except for in the infero-posterior regions </plain></SENT>
