<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Catheter ablation is the preferred management approach for atrioventricular nodal reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AVNRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cryothermal ablation (Cryo) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are the two clinically available ablation modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Atrioventricular (AV) block is a concerning potential complication and is commonly preceded by transient <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> or rapid junctional beats when using RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For challenging AVNRT cases, where RFA produced signs of impending <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp>, we evaluate the application of Cryo to the same anatomical location where RFA was abandoned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cryo was applied in 10 out of 313 (3.2%) total AVNRT cases from January of 2007 to June of 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In these cases, right-sided RFA failed in eliminating AVNRT and was aborted due to transient <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> or rapid junctional rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cryo lesions were then applied to the same anatomical location where RFA was discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed and evaluated for AVNRT recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine out of ten patients had complete elimination of AVNRT after Cryo, one of whom required a second procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This strategy failed in one patient, where left-sided RFA was required to eliminate AVNRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was one complication, tamponade, in the failed case, which was successfully managed with no long-term sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this cohort of challenging AVNRT cases where right-sided RFA was aborted due to signs of impending <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp>, applying Cryo to the same anatomical location provided procedural success, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A prospective study is needed to accurately evaluate the safety and efficacy of this strategy </plain></SENT>
