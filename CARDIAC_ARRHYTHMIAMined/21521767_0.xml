<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study tested the hypothesis that sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and L-type calcium channel activity determine the beat-to-beat response and its rate dependency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, patch-clamp technique and confocal calcium imaging was used to record L-type calcium current (ICa) and visualize calcium in human atrial myocytes subjected to increasing stimulation frequencies (from 0.2 to 2 Hz) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The beat-to-beat response was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> among a population of 133 myocytes, with 30 myocytes responding uniformly at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> frequencies, while alternating and irregular responses were induced in 78 and 25 myocytes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Myocytes with uniform responses had the lowest frequency of calcium wave-induced transient inward currents (ITI; 0.4 ± 0.2 min⁻¹), ICa density (1.8 ± 0.3 pA pF⁻¹) and <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi>-releasable calcium load (6.2 ± 0.5 amol pF⁻¹), while those with alternating responses had the highest ITI frequency (1.8 ± 0.3 min⁻¹,P =0.003) and ICa density (2.4 ± 0.2 pA pF⁻¹, P =0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the calcium load was highest in myocytes with irregular responses (8.5 ± 0.7 amol pF⁻¹, P =0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, partial ICa inhibition reduced the incidence (from 78 to 44%, P &lt;0.05) and increased the threshold frequency for beat-to-beat alternation (from 1.3 ± 0.2 to 1.9 ± 0.2 Hz, P &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Partial inhibition of SR calcium release reduced the ITI frequency, increased calcium loading and favoured induction of irregular responses, while complete inhibition abolished beat-to-beat alternation at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the beat-to-beat response was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> among human atrial myocytes subjected to increasing stimulation frequencies, and the nature and stability of the response were determined by the SR and L-type calcium channel activities, suggesting that these mechanisms are key to controlling cardiac beat-to-beat stability </plain></SENT>
