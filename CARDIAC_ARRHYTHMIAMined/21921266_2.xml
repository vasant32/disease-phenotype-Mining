<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE: Myofibroblasts typically appear in the myocardium after insults to the heart like mechanical overload and infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Apart from contributing to fibrotic remodeling, myofibroblasts induce arrhythmogenic slow conduction and ectopic activity in cardiomyocytes after establishment of heterocellular electrotonic coupling in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>So far, it is not known whether α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) containing stress fibers, the cytoskeletal components that set myofibroblasts apart from resident fibroblasts, are essential for myofibroblasts to develop arrhythmogenic interactions with cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether pharmacological ablation of α-SMA containing stress fibers by actin-targeting drugs affects arrhythmogenic myofibroblast-cardiomyocyte cross-talk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Experiments were performed with patterned growth cell cultures of neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes coated with cardiac myofibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The preparations exhibited slow conduction and ectopic activity under control conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exposure to actin-targeting drugs (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23528">Cytochalasin</z:chebi> D, Latrunculin B, Jasplakinolide) for 24 hours led to disruption of α-SMA containing stress fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In parallel, conduction velocities increased dose-dependently to values indistinguishable from cardiomyocyte-only preparations and ectopic activity measured continuously over 24 hours was completely suppressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mechanistically, antiarrhythmic effects were due to myofibroblast hyperpolarization (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23528">Cytochalasin</z:chebi> D, Latrunculin B) and disruption of heterocellular gap junctional coupling (Jasplakinolide), which caused normalization of membrane polarization of adjacent cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that α-SMA containing stress fibers importantly contribute to myofibroblast arrhythmogeneicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After ablation of this cytoskeletal component, cells lose their arrhythmic effects on cardiomyocytes, even if heterocellular electrotonic coupling is sustained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The findings identify α-SMA containing stress fibers as a potential future target of antiarrhythmic therapy in hearts undergoing structural remodeling </plain></SENT>
