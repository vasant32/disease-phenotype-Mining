<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Unlike other excitation-contraction uncouplers, blebbistatin has few electrophysiological side effects and has gained increasing acceptance as an excitation-contraction uncoupler in optical mapping experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the possible role of blebbistatin in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> has hitherto been unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, experiments with blebbistatin and 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM) offer an opportunity to assess the contribution of dynamic instability and wavelength of impulse propagation to the induction and maintenance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recordings of monophasic action potentials were used to assess effects of blebbistatin in Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, panoramic optical mapping experiments were conducted in rabbit hearts (n = 7) that were sequentially perfused with BDM, then washed out, and subsequently perfused with blebbistatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was investigated using a shock-on-T protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that 1) application of blebbistatin did not change action potential duration (APD) restitution; 2) in contrast to blebbistatin, BDM flattened APD restitution curve and reduced the wavelength; and 3) incidence of sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was much lower under blebbistatin than under BDM (2/123 vs. 23/99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> under BDM were able to stabilize, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> under blebbistatin were unstable and terminated spontaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the lower susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> under blebbistatin than under BDM indicates that blebbistatin has less effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> dynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A steep restitution slope under blebbistatin is associated with higher dynamic instability, manifested by the higher incidence of not only wave breaks but also wave extinctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This relatively high dynamic instability leads to the self-termination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> because of the sufficiently long wavelength under blebbistatin </plain></SENT>
