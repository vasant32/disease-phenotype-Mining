<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many attempts have been made to construct mathematical descriptions of this phenomenon, beginning with the simple formulation of Koch-Wesser and Blinks in 1963 to the most sophisticated ones of today </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This property of cardiac muscle is amplified by Î²-adrenergic stimulation, and, in a coordinated way, the neurohumoral state alters both frequency (acting on the sinoatrial node) as well as force generation (modifying ventricular myocytes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This synchronized tuning is needed to meet new metabolic demands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiac modelers have already linked mechanical and electrical activity in their formulations and showed how those activities feedback on each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, now it is necessary to include neurological control to have a complete description of heart performance, especially when changes in frequency are involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (or antiarrhythmic drugs) based on mathematical models should incorporate this effect to make useful predictions or point out potential pharmaceutical targets </plain></SENT>
