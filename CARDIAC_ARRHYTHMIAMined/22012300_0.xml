<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The surgical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> is recommended in symptomatic patients as well as in asymptomatic patients at low postoperative risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a "stand alone" procedure, surgical ablation therapy is indicated after failed catheter ablation therapy, which occurs increasingly due to the high number of catheter-based ablation techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to gain acceptance among patients as well as referring cardiologists, the surgical ablation procedure ought to be performed in a minimally invasive fashion and with a very high success rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When applied in an interdisciplinary approach by cardiologists/electrophysiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons, both ablative techniques have the potential to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> effectively and in the long-term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In order to document the true heart rhythm after ablation therapy, intermittent "snapshot" ECG documentation ought to be avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Small leadless devices that can be implanted subcutaneously enable full heart rhythm disclosure with documentation of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The modern technique of implantable loop recorders permits individualized treatment for each patient </plain></SENT>
