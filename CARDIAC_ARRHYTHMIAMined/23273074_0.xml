<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an analysis of a single-center series of 279 retroperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomies from 1996 to 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared 172 cases performed with an antegrade approach and 107 with a retrograde approach without dissection of the renal hilum and initial control of the adrenal vein in comparable populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The operative time was shorter in the group treated with the retrograde technique, 101±51 vs 140±40 minutes, respectively (Student's t test, P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood loss was similar in both groups, 85±224 vs 80±126 mL, respectively (P=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hemodynamic instability</z:e> was defined as the maximal systolic blood pressure minus the minimal systolic blood pressure divided the maximal systolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was lower in the group who underwent the retrograde technique (32.7 vs 37.6 mL; Student's t test, P=.005) with a lower perioperative consumption of ephedrine (2.2 vs 5.1 mg, P=.004) and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> (0.09 vs 0.22 mg, P=.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No difference was found between the 2 groups in the frequency of perioperative complications or postoperative mortality (1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in each group of causes unrelated to the surgery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Retroperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy using a retrograde approach is a safe and reproducible technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It makes it possible to perform adrenalectomy without dissection of the renal hilum, with a reduction in the operative time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The good hemodynamic stability observed with this technique makes it very attractive for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
