<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In subclinical or silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo>, the QT interval is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> under basal conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis that insults to the repolarization reserve may cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in silent mutation carriers but not in noncarriers has been proposed as a general principle, yet crucial aspects remain descriptive, lacking quantification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To utilize accurate mathematical models of the human action potential and β-adrenergic stimulation to quantitatively investigate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-formation mechanisms peculiar to silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo>, using mutation Q357R in KCNQ1 (α subunit of slow-delayed rectifier I(Ks)) as a paradigm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Markov models were formulated to account for altered I(Ks) kinetics in Q357R compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> and introduced into a detailed model of the human ventricular myocyte action potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dominant negative loss of I(Ks) available reserve accurately represents Q357R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Action potential prolongation with mutant I(Ks) was minimal, reproducing the silent phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Partial block of rapid delayed rectifier current (I(Kr)) was needed in addition to fast pacing and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> application to cause early afterdepolarizations (EADs) in epicardial cells with mutant I(Ks), but this did not produce EADs in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reduced channel expression at the membrane, not I(Ks) kinetic differences, caused EADs in the silent mutant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With mutant I(Ks), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> plus partial I(Kr) block resulted in dramatic QT prolongation in the pseudo-electrocardiogram and EADs formed without I(Kr) block in mid-myocardial cells during simulated exercise <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Multiple severe insults are needed to evince an arrhythmic phenotype in silent mutation Q357R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reduced membrane I(Ks) expression, not kinetic changes, underlies the arrhythmic phenotype </plain></SENT>
