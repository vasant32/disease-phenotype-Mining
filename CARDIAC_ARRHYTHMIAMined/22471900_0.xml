<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Symptom recurrence following sinus node modification (SNM) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>inappropriate sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> (IST) remains significant despite achieving <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> procedural success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The impact of non-IST tachyarrhythmias on symptom recurrence remains poorly characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The objective was to determine the prevalence and nature of additional tachyarrhythmias preceding and following SNM for IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with IST undergoing SNM at the University of Pennsylvania were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SNM was initially performed using an anatomic approach targeting the superolateral crista terminalis under intracardiac echocardiographic guidance and later using an electrophysiologic approach, targeting the site of the earliest right atrial activation during maximum heart rate (HR) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An effort was made to shift the site more caudally until a decrease of &gt;25% in resting HR was achieved, with a blunted response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> and flattening of the P-wave axis in leads III and aVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tachyarrhythmias were documented with electrocardiographic monitoring and then characterized during EP study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-three patients underwent SNM and were followed for a mean of 2.0 Â± 1.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 27% developed a non-IST tachyarrhythmia and 18% developed recurrent IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, 42% of patients had a non-IST tachyarrhythmia prior to SNM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Non-IST tachyarrhythmias are common in patients with IST before and after SNM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A major reason for symptom recurrence following SNM is development of a non-IST tachyarrhythmia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These tachyarrhythmias should be detected and treated to optimize patient outcomes </plain></SENT>
