<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pacemaker hyperpolarization-activated current I(f) was altered in hypertrophic hearts and was probably responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>I(f) channels are compose\d of four hyperpolarization-activated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23447">cyclic nucleotide</z:chebi>-gated <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cation</z:chebi> subunits (HCN1-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A previous study found significantly high levels of HCN2 and HCN4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in hypertrophic hearts compared to control hearts in septum and left ventricles in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No studies, however, have investigated the HCN gene expression in the myocardium from human HCM heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The left ventricular tissue from four patients who died of HCM and six healthy patients who died of motor vehicle accidents was included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fluorescent quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was used to detect HCN4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of HCN4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of the two groups was detected on the assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the HCM hearts, disorganization of the hypertrophic myofibers and interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients, although absent in healthy control hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By quantitative polymerase chain reaction, the mean copy number of HCN4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was 2.2×10(7) (range, 6.8×10(6) to 4.55×10(7)) in HCM hearts and 8.17×10(3) (range, 8.76×10(1) to 3.5×10(4)) in control hearts (P=.0318) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Higher HCN4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in the HCM hearts suggest that up-regulation of HCN4 gene expression might be responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> that leads to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
