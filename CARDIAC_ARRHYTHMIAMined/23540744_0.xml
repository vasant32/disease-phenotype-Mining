<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most typical manifestation of cardiotoxicity is a hypokinetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the spectrum of the toxic effects that can impair the cardiovascular system may also include <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndromes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment are more vulnerable to cardiovascular injuries, and their risk of premature <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is higher than that of the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prevention of cardiotoxicity remains the most important strategy, and several measures, including cardiac function monitoring, limitation of chemotherapy dose, use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> analogues and cardioprotectants, and early detection of myocardial cell injury by biomarkers, have been proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The response to modern <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> has never been evaluated in clinical trials, and currently there are no definitive guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although it is likely that medications used for other forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, particularly <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors</z:chebi> and Î²-blockers, may be highly effective, there is still some unjustified concern regarding their use in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specific guidelines that take cardiologic conditions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients into account are currently lacking and need to be developed </plain></SENT>
