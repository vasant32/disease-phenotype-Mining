<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In human atrium, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>) exerts pleiotropic effects, which are thought to be mediated via 5-HT4 receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we used transgenic mice (TG) that overexpress the human 5-HT4(a) receptor under control of the heart-specific α-myosin heavy chain promoter in the atria (and ventricles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Contractile studies were performed in isolated electrically driven left atrial preparations and spontaneously beating right atrial preparation of TG and littermate control mice (<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (WT)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> increased force of contraction and phospholamban phosphorylation on serine 16 only in left atrial preparations from TG but not from WT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, β-adrenoceptor stimulation of left atrial preparations by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoprenaline</z:chebi> increased force of contraction with similar pEC50 values and to a similar maximum extent in both TG and WT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The contractile effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> in left atrial preparations from TG could be blocked by the 5-HT4 receptor-specific <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> GR125487 or GR113808 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In right atrial preparations from WT and TG, the β-adrenoceptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoprenaline</z:chebi> exerted a positive chronotropic effect with similar pEC50 values and similar maximum effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only in right atrial preparations from TG but not WT, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> exerted a positive chronotropic effect that could be attenuated by 5-HT4 receptor-specific <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, in left atrial preparations of TG, a higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> was noted compared to WT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present data indicate that the human 5-HT4 receptors expressed in mouse atria are functional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is the first <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519606" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">transgenic model</z:e> to study this human receptor in the atrium ex vivo or in vivo </plain></SENT>
