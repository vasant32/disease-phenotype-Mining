<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, so far no attempt has been made to specifically elucidate their influence on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study was performed to evaluate whether an infusion of either l-leucine or l-valine in a dose of 1mgkg(-1)h(-1) 10min before a 7-min period of left anterior descending <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 15min of reperfusion, had an effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> measured during the reperfusion phase in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>- and reperfusion-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> model in rats in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of the infusion of these substances on mean arterial blood pressure was monitored throughout the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both of the tested amino acids exhibited significant antiarrhythmic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>l-Leucine reduced the duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.05) and l-valine decreased the duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The two amino acids were generally hypotensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>l-Valine lowered blood pressure in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> phases of the experiment (P&lt;0.05) while l-leucine lowered this parameter mainly towards the end of occlusion and reperfusion (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, 30min infusion of the amino acids in the used dose did not produce any apparent adverse histological changes that were remarkably different from control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, the results of our study suggest that l-leucine and l-valine in the dose that was used attenuates <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and are hypotensive in their influence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings lend support to the many ongoing investigations into the benefit of the application of l-leucine and l-valine in cardiology like their addition to cardioplegic solutions </plain></SENT>
