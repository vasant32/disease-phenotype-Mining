<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Laboratory mice typically are anesthetized by either inhalation of volatile <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anesthetics</z:chebi> or injection of drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we compared the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and postanesthetic effects of combining both methods with standard inhalant monoanesthesia using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After injection of fentanyl-midazolam or S-ketamine as premedication, a standard 50-min anesthesia was conducted by using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Addition of fentanyl-midazolam (0.04 mg/kg-4 mg/kg) induced sedation, attenuation of aversive behaviors at induction, shortening of the induction phase, and reduced the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> concentration required by one third (3.3% compared with 5%), compared with S-ketamine (30 mg/kg) premedication or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During anesthesia, heart rate and core body temperature were depressed significantly by both premedications but in general remained within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ranges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, with or without premedication, substantial respiratory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was evident, with a marked decline in respiratory rate accompanied by <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>, and occasionally <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred under S-ketamine-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postanesthetic telemetric measurements showed unchanged locomotor activity but elevated heart rate and core body temperature at 12 h; these changes were most prominent during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> monoanesthesia and least pronounced or absent during fentanyl-midazolam-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, combining injectable and inhalant <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anesthetics</z:chebi> in mice can be advantageous compared with inhalation monoanesthesia at induction and postanesthetically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, adverse physiologic side effects during anesthesia can be exacerbated by premedications, requiring careful selection of drugs and dosages </plain></SENT>
