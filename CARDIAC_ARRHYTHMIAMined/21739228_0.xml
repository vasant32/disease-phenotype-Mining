<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to evaluate the utility of routine cardiac monitoring in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> observation unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We prospectively studied the utility of routine cardiac monitoring in 249 consecutive patients admitted to an observation unit in an academic Emergency Department over a 6-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> thought to be <z:mp ids='MP_0004120'>cardiac ischemia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Observation included serial cardiac enzymes, ECG cardiac monitoring, and exercise testing in a designated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> observation unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These patients were determined to be at low risk for an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary event by two criteria: first, the symptoms had resolved by the time of observation unit admission, and second, the initial ECG was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, unchanged or non-diagnostic for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adverse outcomes included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, hospital admission secondary to cardiac dysrhythmia, or alteration in the patient's medical therapy upon discharge from the observation unit, secondary to cardiac dysrhythmia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 249 patients included with a median age of 52 with 60% women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifteen percent of the patients were, subsequently, admitted to the hospital for further evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> based on enzyme, ECG, and exercise testing results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient with known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221047" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Tachy-Brady syndrome</z:e> was noted to have 1.5-2 s pauses while sleeping, and discharged with instructions to hold beta blocker therapy pending results of a continuous loop recorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 248 patients, no patient suffered a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, no patient was admitted to the hospital secondary to cardiac dysrhythmia, and no alteration in a patient's medical therapy was made secondary to cardiac dysrhythmia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No patient returned to the Emergency Department within 72 h with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dysrhythmia or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although telemetry may be the standard of care in evaluating the patients with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndromes, regardless of the probability of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic syndrome, in those patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or non diagnostic ECG and resolved symptoms, routine cardiac monitoring is unnecessary </plain></SENT>
