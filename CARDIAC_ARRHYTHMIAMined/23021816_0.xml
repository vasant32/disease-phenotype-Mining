<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the rate of prevalence of significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in emergency medical service (EMS) subjects referred for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> and screened with pre-hospital tele-cardiology ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 2648 consecutive EMS patients referred for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> were evaluated with tele-cardiology support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pre-hospital ECGs were sent to a single tele-cardiology "hub", active 24/7 and serving a region of 4-million inhabitants, and promptly read by a cardiologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> or conduction disturbances was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In more than 55% of cases ECG findings were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>; in 13% ECG showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo>, in 9% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001688'>sinus bradycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> was 0.20%, while significant AV-disturbances were present in 1.12% of cases (0.11% second-degree type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV-block</z:mp>, 0.11% advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV-block</z:mp>, 0.19% third-degree <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV-block</z:mp>, 0.45% junctional rhythm, 0.26% ventricular rhythm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Limited gender differences were detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were found in subjects younger than 30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of several <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> was age related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> among EMS patients referred for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> and evaluated with pre-hospital tele-cardiology ECG is low, and almost absent in subjects below 30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Tele-cardiology pre-hospital screening by a single regional "hub" may be helpful for the prompt diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
