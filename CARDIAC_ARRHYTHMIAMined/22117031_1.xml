<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to demonstrate the added value of routine use of transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for the correct positioning of the transseptal system in the fossa ovalis, thus potentially preventing complications during fluoroscopy-guided TP performed by inexperienced operators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Two hundred and five patients undergoing pulmonary vein isolation procedure (PVI) for drug-resistant paroxysmal or persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> were prospectively included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When the operator (initially blinded to TEE) assumed that the transseptal system was in a correct position according to fluoroscopical landmarks, the latter was then checked with TEE unblinding the physician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If necessary, further refinement of the catheter position was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Refinement &gt;10 mm, or in case of catheter pointing directly at the aortic root or posterior wall were considered as major repositioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients required major repositioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis revealed age (P: 0.0001, Wald: 12.9, 95% confidence interval: 1.04-1.16), left atrial diameter (P: 0.01, Wald: 6.6, 95% confidence interval: 1.04-1.34), previous PVI (P: 0.01, Wald: 6.3, 95% confidence interval: 1.31-8.76), and atrial septal thickness (P: 0.03, Wald: 4.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.05-3.4) as independent predictors of major revision with TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Routine 2D TEE in addition to traditional fluoroscopic TP appears to be very useful to guide the TP assembly in a correct puncture position and thus, to avoid TP-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, further randomized prospective comparative studies are necessary to support these suggestions </plain></SENT>
