<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a 30-year-old basketball player with asymptomatic, nocturnal ventricular pauses of &gt;3,000 ms, the longest being âˆ¼12,000 ms, who was misdiagnosed with Mobitz type II second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the tracings were characteristic of a vagally mediated <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp>, a phenomenon first described by Massie and called "apparent Mobitz type II <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp>." Although the patient was asymptomatic with ventricular pauses occurring only at night, it was decided to implant a permanent pacemaker to prevent neurological damage or life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> resulting from repeated, abnormally prolonged ventricular pauses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The persistence of <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> after a 3-month detraining period led us to believe that our decision was reasonable </plain></SENT>
