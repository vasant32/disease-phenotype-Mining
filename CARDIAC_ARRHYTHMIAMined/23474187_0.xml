<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Signaling pathways that maintain circadian rhythms (CRs) in immune function in vivo, and the mechanisms by which circadian desynchrony impairs immune function, remain to be fully-identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These experiments tested the hypothesis that the hypothalamic circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29425">(SCN)</z:chebi> drives CRs in the immune system, using a non-invasive model of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">SCN</z:chebi> circadian <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Robust CRs in blood leukocyte trafficking, with a peak during the early light phase (ZT4) and nadir in the early dark phase (ZT18), were absent in arrhythmic hamsters, as were CRs in spleen clock gene (per1, bmal1) expression, indicating that a functional pacemaker in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">SCN</z:chebi> is required for the generation of CRs in leukocyte trafficking and for driving peripheral clocks in secondary lymphoid organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pinealectomy was without effect on CRs in leukocyte trafficking, but abolished CRs in spleen clock gene expression, indicating that nocturnal <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> secretion is necessary for communicating circadian time information to the spleen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CRs in trafficking of antigen presenting cells (CD11c(+) dendritic cells) in the skin were abolished, and antigen-specific <z:mp ids='MP_0002534'>delayed-type hypersensitivity</z:mp> skin <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> were markedly impaired in arrhythmic hamsters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">SCN</z:chebi> drives robust CRs in leukocyte trafficking and lymphoid clock gene expression; the latter of which is not expressed in the absence of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Robust entrainment of the circadian pacemaker provides a signal critical to diurnal rhythms in immunosurveilliance and optimal memory T-cell dependent immune responses </plain></SENT>
