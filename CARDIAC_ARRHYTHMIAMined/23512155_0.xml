<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Innovative optimization of intrathoracic electrogram (EGM) configuration will facilitate P-wave detection and rhythm differentiation during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>.METHODS AND RESULTS: Innovative optimization of EGM configuration was originally performed to improve patient care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this retrospective cohort study, we examined our database for records of 140 consecutive patients undergoing single-chamber <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the follow-ups of 61 included patients with optimized EGM configuration, 27 patients were identified to have VT and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EGMs in the Can (generator) to superior vena cava (Can-SVC) configuration were compared with those conventionally from the Can to right ventricular coil (Can-RV coil) source in the same patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Can-SVC EGMs, the ratio of P/QRS amplitude was 14-fold higher (0.57 ± 0.08 vs. 0.04 ± 0.00, P &lt; 0.001) compared with those in Can-RV coil EGMs during sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With Can-SVC configuration, the odds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011709'>atrioventricular dissociation</z:hpo> detection in patients with VT was increased 15-fold (61.9% vs. 9.5% with Can-RV coil; odds ratio, 15.4; 95% confidence interval, 2.8 to 84.7; P = 0.0009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>, P-waves or retrograde P-waves were markedly more identifiable in Can-SVC configuration compared with Can-RV coil (odds ratio, 40; 95% confidence interval, 3.6 to 447.1; P = 0.0010).CONCLUSION: P-wave recognition by optimizing EGM configuration provides a novel diagnostic tool for differentiation between VT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> in single-chamber <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
