<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 69 patients, 42 had symptomatic ARVC and 27 were mutation positive asymptomatic family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty healthy individuals served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Myocardial strain was assessed in 6 RV and 16 left ventricular (LV) segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Contraction duration (CD) in 6 RV and 16 LV segments were measured as the time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> R on electrocardiogram to maximum myocardial shortening in each segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The standard deviation of CD was defined as mechanical dispersion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mechanical dispersion was more pronounced in ARVC patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> compared with asymptomatic mutation carriers and healthy individuals in RV [52(41,63) vs. 35(23,47) vs. 13(9,19)ms, P &lt; 0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mechanical dispersion was more pronounced in asymptomatic mutation carriers compared with healthy individuals (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Right ventricular mechanical dispersion predicted VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> in a multivariate logistic regression analysis [odds ratio (OR), 1.66 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-2.58), P &lt; 0.03] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Right ventricular and LV function by strain were reduced in symptomatic ARVC patients and correlated significantly (R = 0.81, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Right ventricular and LV strain were reduced in asymptomatic mutation carriers compared with healthy individuals (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Right ventricular mechanical dispersion was pronounced in patients with ARVC with VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Right ventricular mechanical dispersion was present in asymptomatic mutation carriers and may be helpful in risk stratification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Right ventricular and LV function correlated in ARVC patients implying that ARVC is a biventricular disease </plain></SENT>
