<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 2,535 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> were divided into different age groups or outcome groups, and the outcome or the incidence of in-hospital complications were reviewed in different groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1)The rate of in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was higher in &gt; or =80 years group (22.75%, 326/422) compared with that in 60-79 years group (12.26%, 1 854/2 113, chi (2)=42.15, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(2)Compared with the survivors (1,854 cases, 27.1%, 17.4%, 7.5%, 4.5%, 4.5%, 40.3%, 9.1%), patients who died in hospital (259 cases) were more likely to have cardiogenic shock (44.0%), Killp II-III heart function (28.2%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> (14.3%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (11.2%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> (11.2%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> (49.8%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (14.7%) in 60-79 years group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No difference in the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006532'>pulmonary infection</z:hpo> (24.7% vs. 20.2%) and alimentary tract <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (5.8% vs. 3.9%) was found between two groups (both P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of cardiogenic shock (28.1%), Killp II-III heart function (32.3%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> (17.7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> (16.7%), alimentary tract <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (10.4%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> (49.0%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (21.9%) was higher in non-survival group (96 cases) than that in survival group (326 cases, 12.9%, 21.2%, 9.2%, 5.2%, 2.1%, 35.0%, 10.1%, P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01) in patients&gt; or =80 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (11.4% vs. 5.8%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006532'>pulmonary infection</z:hpo> (32.3% vs. 23.3%) between two groups (both P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(3) The foremost four in-hospital complications in the non-survivors and survivors were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, cardiogenic shock, Killp II-III heart function and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006532'>pulmonary infection</z:hpo> in 60-79 years group, but they were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006532'>pulmonary infection</z:hpo>, Killp II-III heart function and cardiogenic shock in &gt; or =80 years group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When compared the cases of in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> between these two different age groups, the incidence of cardiogenic shock was significantly lower in the &gt; or =80 years group (28.1% vs. 44.0%, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> was higher in the &gt; or =80 years group than that in 60-79 years group (22.92% vs. 7.34%, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The number and degree of in-hospital complications in elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> are increased by age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> is the major complication in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For the patients 60-79 years old, it is more important to prevent and treat cardiogenic shock in order to improve the outcome in the 60-70 years group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In very old people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>, it is important to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
