<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Diesel exhaust (DE), which is emitted from on- and off-road sources, is a complex mixture of toxic gaseous and particulate components that leads to triggered adverse cardiovascular effects such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that increased risk of triggered <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> 1 day after DE exposure is mediated by airway sensory nerves bearing transient receptor potential (TRP) channels [e.g., transient receptor potential <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cation</z:chebi> channel, member A1 (TRPA1)] that, when activated by noxious chemicals, can cause a centrally mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262385" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic imbalance</z:e> and heightened risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Spontaneously hypertensive rats implanted with radiotelemeters were whole-body exposed to either 500 μg/m³ (high) or 150 μg/m³ (low) whole DE (wDE) or filtered DE (fDE), or to filtered air (controls), for 4 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arrhythmogenesis was assessed 24 hr later by continuous intravenous infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2430">aconitine</z:chebi>, an arrhythmogenic drug, while heart rate (HR) and electrocardiogram (ECG) were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rats exposed to wDE or fDE had slightly higher HRs and increased low-frequency:high-frequency ratios (sympathetic modulation) than did controls; ECG showed prolonged ventricular depolarization and shortened repolarization periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats exposed to wDE developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> at lower doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2430">aconitine</z:chebi> than did controls; the dose was even lower in rats exposed to fDE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of low wDE-exposed rats with a TRPA1 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> or sympathetic blockade prevented the heightened sensitivity to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that a single exposure to DE increases the sensitivity of the heart to triggered <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The gaseous components appear to play an important role in the proarrhythmic response, which may be mediated by activation of TRPA1, and subsequent sympathetic modulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As such, toxic inhalants may partly exhibit their toxicity by lowering the threshold for secondary triggers, complicating assessment of their risk </plain></SENT>
