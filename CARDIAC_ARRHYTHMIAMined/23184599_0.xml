<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e>) are designed to deliver shocks or antitachycardia pacing (ATP) in the event of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> recipients experience the sensation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> discharge in the absence of an actual discharge (phantom shock) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and predictors of phantom shocks in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical records of 629 consecutive patients with ischaemic or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 35 months, phantom shocks were reported by 5.1 % of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> recipients (5.7 % in the primary prevention group and 3.7 % for the secondary prevention group; p=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the combined group of primary and secondary prevention, there were no significant predictors of the occurrence of phantom shocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in the primary prevention group, phantom shocks were related to a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (p=0.03) and NYHA class &lt;III (p=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the secondary prevention group, there were no significant predictors for phantom shocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Phantom shocks occur in approximately 5 % of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In primary prevention patients, a relation with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and NYHA class &lt;III were significant predictors for the occurrence of phantom shocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the secondary prevention patients, no significant predictors were found </plain></SENT>
