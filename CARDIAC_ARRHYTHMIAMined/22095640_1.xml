<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Cox-Maze procedure (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi>) has achieved high success rates in the therapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) while becoming progressively less invasive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report evaluates our experience with the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> in the treatment of lone AF over 2 decades and compares the original cut-and-sew <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi>-III to the ablation-assisted <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi>-IV, which uses bipolar radiofrequency and cryoenergy to create the original lesion pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Data were collected prospectively on 212 consecutive patients (mean age, 53.5±10.4 years; 78% male) who underwent a stand-alone <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> from 1992 through 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median duration of preoperative AF was 6 (interquartile range, 2.9-11.5) years, with 48% paroxysmal and 52% persistent or long-standing persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis with preoperative and perioperative variables used as covariates for the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi>-III (n=112) and the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi>-IV (n=100) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, 30-day mortality was 1.4%, with no intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Freedom from AF was 93%, and freedom from AF off antiarrhythmics was 82%, at a mean follow-up time of 3.6±3.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Freedom from symptomatic AF at 10 years was 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 1 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred, with 80% of patients not receiving anticoagulation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The less invasive <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi>-IV had significantly shorter cross-clamp times (41±13 versus 92±26 minutes; P&lt;0.001) while achieving high success rates, with 90% freedom from AF and 84% freedom from AF off antiarrhythmics at 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi>, although simplified and shortened by alternative energy sources, has excellent results, even with improved follow-up and stricter definition of failure </plain></SENT>
