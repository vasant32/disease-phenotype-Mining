<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we show that uncoupling in rat cardiomyocytes after stimulation of α-adrenergic Gαq-coupled receptors with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> is prevented by proteasomal and lysosomal inhibitors, suggesting that internalization and possibly degradation of connexin43 (Cx43) is involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Uncoupling was accompanied by increased <z:chebi fb="60" ids="29234">Triton</z:chebi> X-100 solubility of Cx43, which is considered a measure of the non-junctional pool of Cx43 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, inhibition of the proteasome and lysosome further increased solubility while preserving coupling, suggesting that communicating gap junctions can be part of the soluble fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ubiquitination of Cx43 was also increased, and Cx43 co-immunoprecipitated with the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">Norepinephrine</z:chebi> increases ubiquitination of Cx43 in cardiomyocytes, possibly via Nedd4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We suggest that Cx43 is subsequently internalized, which is preceded by acquired solubility in <z:chebi fb="60" ids="29234">Triton</z:chebi> X-100, which does not lead to uncoupling per se </plain></SENT>
