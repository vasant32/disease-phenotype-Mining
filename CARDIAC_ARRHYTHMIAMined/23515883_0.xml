<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Few data are available on actual follow-up costs of remote monitoring (RM) of implantable defibrillators (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our study aimed at assessing current direct costs of 1-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> follow-up based on RM compared with conventional quarterly in-hospital follow-ups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients (N = 233) with indications for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> were consecutively recruited and randomized at implant to be followed up for 1 year with standard quarterly in-hospital visits or by RM with one in-hospital visit at 12 months, unless additional in-hospital visits were required due to specific patient conditions or RM alarms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Costs were calculated distinguishing between provider and patient costs, excluding RM device and service cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of scheduled in-hospital visits was lower in the RM group than in the control arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up required 47 min per patient/year in the RM arm versus 86 min in the control arm (p = 0.03) for involved physicians, generating cost estimates for the provider of USD 45 and USD 83 per patient/year, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Costs for nurses were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, the costs associated with RM and standard follow-up were USD 103 ± 27 and 154 ± 21 per patient/year, respectively (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RM was cost-saving for the patients: USD 97��± 121 per patient/year in the RM group versus 287 ± 160 per patient/year (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The time spent by the hospital staff was significantly reduced in the RM group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If the costs for the device and service are not charged to patients or the provider, patients could save about USD 190 per patient/year while the hospital could save USD 51 per patient/year </plain></SENT>
