<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) is characterized by ventricular chamber enlargement and systolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> remains uncertain, and the TNNT2 gene is potentially associated with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To assess the role of TNNT2 in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, we examined 10 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 97 DCM patients and 189 control subjects were included in the study, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SNPs were genotyped by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the TNNT2 gene, there was a significant association between <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and genotype for the tagging SNPs rs3729547 (χ (2) = 6.63, P = 0.036, OR = 0.650, and 95% CI = 0.453-0.934) and rs3729843 (χ (2) = 9.787, P = 0.008, OR = 1.912, and 95% CI = 1.265-2.890) in the Chinese Han population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis showed that the SNPs rs7521796, rs2275862, rs3729547, rs10800775, and rs1892028, which are approximately 6 kb apart, were in high LD (D' &gt; 0.80) in the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the TNNT2 polymorphisms might play an important role in susceptibility to <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> in the Chinese Han population </plain></SENT>
