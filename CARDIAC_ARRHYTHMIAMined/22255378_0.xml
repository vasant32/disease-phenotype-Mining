<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These channels also exhibit a late, slowly-inactivating component of current (late I(Na)) that may be enhanced under pathological conditions such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, and may therefore promote AP prolongation and increase the likelihood of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) functionally modifies <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channels, however it remains unclear if the CaMKII-dependent changes in late I(Na) are a major contributor to cellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> such as early after depolarizations (EADs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we develop a model of I(Na), including CaMKII-dependent effects, based on experimental measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channel model is incorporated into a computational model of the whole myocyte which describes excitation-contraction coupling via stochastic simulation of individual Ca(2+) release sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Simulations suggest that relatively small augmentation of late I(Na) is sufficient to significantly prolong APs and lead to the appearance of EADs </plain></SENT>
