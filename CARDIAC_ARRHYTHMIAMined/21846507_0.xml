<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In humans and other vertebrates, mental or physical stressors may trigger a variety of symptoms generally referred to as the fight/flight response (Cannon 1929) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The processes also include variability of the heart frequency as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We monitored both body responses in disturbed hibernating vineyard snails, H. pomatia, to obtain information on the stress sensitivity of these "sleeping" invertebrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first mild stressor, a 100 meter transport of hibernating snails from the cold room to the laboratory, caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> in the animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This reaction could have been provoked by mechanical disturbances and/or by raising the body temperature to room temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>But a change in the ambient temperature did not trigger an <z:mp ids='MP_0004085'>abnormal heart rhythm</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Different from this observation, we recorded instant heart rate changes in response to knocking on the shell and a very <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>irregular heartbeat</z:hpo> occurred when a hole was punched in the shell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With a short time delay upon damaging the shell, a large increase in the number of circulating cells also occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was not observed after knocking on the shell or when snails were adapted to different temperatures for each 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, hibernating snails sense environmental variations which cause an immediate change of the heart frequency and an elevated stimulus level initiates in addition <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> which occurs at a post-stimulus latency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This disparity could indicate the activity of two different stress regulation pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the assays demonstrate an increasing linear relation between rising temperature and frequency of heart pulsations (y=1.01x-2.1); but the results do not indicate a correlation between heartbeat frequency and the number of cells in circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Consequently, neither temperature nor heart frequency seems to influence the number of circulating cells in hibernating H. pomatia </plain></SENT>
