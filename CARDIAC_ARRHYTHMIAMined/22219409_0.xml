<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Whether patients with recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (PAF) might benefit of epicardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) ablation concomitant to coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this prospective, randomized, single-centre pilot study is the comparison of patients with first diagnosed AF submitted to CABG and treated with and without epicardial pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with first diagnosed PAF and indication for CABG were enrolled in this prospective randomized pilot study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was AF-free survival (AF burden &lt;0.5%) between the two groups at 18-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The secondary endpoints were the percentage of AF burden defined through continuous monitoring using an implantable loop recorder, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> and procedural complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were implanted with a subcutaneous cardiac monitor to track the cardiac rhythm and measure the AF burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This study enrolled 35 patients (mean age 59 ± 7 years, 74% males), followed up for 18 months after CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients were randomly allocated to two groups, CABG alone (n = 17) and CABG with concomitant PVI (n = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 18-month follow-up after surgery, 16 (89%) patients in the CABG + PVI group were AF-free (i.e. AF% &lt; 0.5%) vs 8 (47%) in the CABG only group (log-rank test, P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the end of follow-up, the mean AF burden in the CABG and the CABG + PVI group was 7.8 ± 5.1 and 1.6 ± 1.8%, respectively (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two (18.2%) of the 11 patients with AF recurrences were completely asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF submitted to CABG may benefit of concomitant ablation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> for preventing recurrences </plain></SENT>
