<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, I(Ks) blockade during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion has not been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the electrophysiological effects of two I(Ks) blockers, chromanol 293B (10 μm) and HMR 1556 (1 μm), were assessed in an in vitro model of border zone between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and ischemic/reperfused right ventricular myocardium from guinea-pigs, and classic electrophysiological parameters and the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HMR 1556 and chromanol 293B exhibited slight conventional class III effects on action potential duration in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> zone (NZ) (APD(90) : -2 ± 5%, not significant (NS); +6 ± 3%, NS; and +5 ± 1%, P &lt; 0.05, respectively, in control, HMR 1556, and chromanol 293B groups) but failed to oppose its decrease after 30 min of simulated ischemic superfusion (APD(90) : -52 ± 5%, P &lt; 0.01; -64 ± 5%, P &lt; 0.01; and -61 ± 3%, P &lt; 0.01, respectively, in control, HMR 1556, and chromanol 293B groups), leading to repolarization dispersion between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and ischemic zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chromanol 293B and HMR 1556 prolonged APD(90) during reperfusion, respectively, by +11 ± 1%, P &lt; 0.01 and +25 ± 4%, P &lt; 0.01 in the NZ and by +13 ± 3%, NS and +31 ± 2%, P &lt; 0.01 in the simulated ischemic zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both compounds exhibited neutral arrhythmogenic effects during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, I(Ks) blockade was neutral on the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion in guinea-pig ventricular tissue </plain></SENT>
