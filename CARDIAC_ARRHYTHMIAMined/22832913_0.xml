<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively reviewed 40 patients who underwent epicardial mapping and conclusive ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first attempt to reach the primary endpoint defined as successful creation of detailed map of entire epicardial space and was achieved in 16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the remaining 24 patients, we used the steerable sheath and achieved further success to create an entire map in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the delivery of RF energy, final procedural success was defined as complete abolishment of late potential and no more induction of any VT, and that was obtained in 10 out of 16 patients mapped with conventional sheath and 21 out of 24 patients with steerable sheath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The advantage of the steerable sheath seemed to be consistent, regardless of the site of ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no procedure-related adverse event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The manually controlled steerable sheath was safe and effective to achieve procedural success in patients with epicardial VT </plain></SENT>
