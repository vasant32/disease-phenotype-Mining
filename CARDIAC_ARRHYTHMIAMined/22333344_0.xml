<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pace-mapping at these sites can generate a 12-lead ECG morphological match to a targeted <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT), and in some instances, multiple exit <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphologies</z:mp> can result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At times, this can also result in the initiation of VT, termed pace-mapped induction (PMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that in patients undergoing catheter ablation of VT, scar substrates with multiple exit sites (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) identified during pace-mapping have improved freedom from recurrent VT, and PMI of VT predicts successful sites of termination during ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: High-density mapping was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects to delineate scar (0.5-1.5 mV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sites with abnormal electrograms were tagged, stimulated (bipolar 10 mA at 2 ms), and targeted for ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> was defined as &gt;1 QRS <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> from a single pacing site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PMI was defined as initiation of VT during pace-mapping (400-600 ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a 2-year period, 44 consecutive patients with scar-mediated VT underwent mapping and ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were observed during pace-mapping in 25 patients (57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At 9 months, 74% of patients who exhibited <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> during pace-mapping had no recurrence of VT compared with 42% of those without <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> observed (P=0.024), with an overall freedom from VT of 61% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (30%) demonstrated PMI, and termination of VT was seen in 95% (18/19) of sites where ablation was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: During pace-mapping, electrograms that exhibit <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and PMI may be specific for sites critical to reentry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These functional responses hold promise for identifying important sites for catheter ablation of VT </plain></SENT>
