<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Ablation of right-sided accessory pathways (APs) is sometimes challenging because several anatomical features of the tricuspid annulus (TA) and surrounding structures differ from those of the mitral annulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the electrophysiological characteristics and efficacy of a non-contact mapping (NCM) system for catheter ablation of right-sided APs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined nine APs in six consecutive patients who underwent catheter ablation of right-sided APs with NCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Case 6, we compared NCM with contact activation mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of six patients had two APs, and one of these had previously failed ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed atrial activation during sinus rhythm or atrial pacing using a multiple-electrode array (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16000,17141">MEA</z:chebi>) deployed in the right atrium near the TA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Non-contact mapping identified the AP location as a peri-TA breakout point that appeared prior to or simultaneously with the delta wave <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> APs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Case 6 we confirmed that the peri-TA breakout identified by NCM corresponded to the earliest ventricular activation identified by contact mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We successfully ablated nine APs by radiofrequency (RF) energy application to the breakout sites, while one AP located just above the pole of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16000,17141">MEA</z:chebi> required additional conventionally guided mapping and ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean RF duration was 189.8 ± 119.0 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After 33.2 ± 9.4 months of follow-up, one para-hisian AP and one right lateral AP recurred, but these were successfully ablated in a second procedure using NCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Non-contact mapping was able to identify the location of right-sided APs accurately and quickly </plain></SENT>
