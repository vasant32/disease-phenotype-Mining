<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of PI3Kγ in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> is currently unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice lacking PI3Kγ (PI3Kγ(-/-)) showed runs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> on adrenergic stimulation that could be rescued by a selective β(2)-adrenergic receptor blocker and developed sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> after transverse aortic constriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consistently, fluorescence resonance energy transfer probes revealed abnormal cAMP accumulation after β(2)-adrenergic receptor activation in PI3Kγ(-/-) cardiomyocytes that depended on the loss of the scaffold but not of the catalytic activity of PI3Kγ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Downstream from β-adrenergic receptors, PI3Kγ was found to participate in multiprotein complexes linking protein kinase A to the activation of phosphodiesterase (PDE) 3A, PDE4A, and PDE4B but not of PDE4D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These PI3Kγ-regulated PDEs lowered cAMP and limited protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of L-type calcium channel (Ca(v)1.2) and phospholamban </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In PI3Kγ(-/-) cardiomyocytes, Ca(v)1.2 and phospholamban were hyperphosphorylated, leading to increased Ca(2+) spark occurrence and amplitude on adrenergic stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, PI3Kγ(-/-) cardiomyocytes showed spontaneous Ca(2+) release events and developed arrhythmic calcium transients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PI3Kγ coordinates the coincident signaling of the major cardiac PDE3 and PDE4 isoforms, thus orchestrating a feedback loop that prevents calcium-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
