<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a prospective study, a total of 60 patients with SND were implanted with a dual-chamber PM with two different algorithms for detection of ATs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study was done with a 3 month data collection period retrieved from the memory of PM and with a 7 day external Holter recording period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 13 of 16 (81 %) patients whose Holter recording revealed the presence of ATs, episodes of AT sensing were retrieved from the PM memory with electrograms verifications, confirming that the devices had detected the ATs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Very short ATs seen in Holter recordings were missed by the PM with three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these patients after 3 months of follow up period, there were recognized periods of ATs by the PM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With ten (17 %) patients, there were intermittent periods of undersensing by the PM although continuous <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) was seen in the Holter recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Retrograde conduction caused false AT detection due to repetitive non-reentrant ventriculoatrial synchronous rhythm (RNRVAS) in six (25 %) of the 24 patients with retrograde conduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Even with long AV delay, ATs can be accurately identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, transient undersensing of continuous AF and non-detection of very short AT episodes can still occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Programming a long AV delay predisposes to RNRVAS which can cause false AT detection and symptoms in SND patients who have retrograde conduction </plain></SENT>
