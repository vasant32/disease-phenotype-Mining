<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Atrial tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> is often an important component of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Small noncoding microRNAs are important mediators in many cardiac remodeling paradigms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) has been suggested to be important in ventricular fibrotic remodeling by downregulating Sprouty-1, a protein that suppresses <z:mpath ids='MPATH_180'>fibroblast proliferation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study examined the potential role of miR-21 in the atrial AF substrate resulting from experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Large MIs (based on echocardiographic left ventricular wall motion score index) were created by left anterior descending coronary artery ligation in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes induced by MI versus sham controls were first characterized with echocardiography, histology, biochemistry, and in vivo electrophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional MI rats were then randomized to receive anti-miR-21 (KD21) or scrambled control sequence (Scr21) injections into the left atrial myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Progressive left ventricular enlargement, hypocontractility, <z:mp ids='MP_0004063'>left atrial dilation</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, refractoriness prolongation, and AF promotion occurred in MI rats versus sham controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Atrial tissues of MI rats showed upregulation of miR-21, along with dysregulation of the target genes Sprouty-1, collagen-1, and collagen-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>KD21 treatment reduced atrial miR-21 expression levels in MI rats to values in sham rats, decreased AF duration from 417 (69-1595; median [Q1-Q3]) seconds to 3 (2-16) seconds (8 weeks after MI; P&lt;0.05), and reduced atrial fibrous tissue content from 14.4 ± 1.8% (mean ± <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) to 4.9 ± 1.2% (8 weeks after MI; P&lt;0.05) versus Scr21 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MI-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> leads to AF-promoting atrial remodeling in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Atrial miR-21 knockdown suppresses atrial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and AF promotion, implicating miR-21 as an important signaling molecule for the AF substrate and pointing to miR-21 as a potential target for molecular interventions designed to prevent AF </plain></SENT>
