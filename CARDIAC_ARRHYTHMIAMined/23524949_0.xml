<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>KCNE genes encode for a small family of Kv channel ancillary subunits that form heteromeric complexes with Kv channel alpha subunits to modify their functional properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in KCNE genes have been found in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> such as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the precise molecular pathophysiology that leads to these diseases remains elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In previous studies the electrophysiological properties of the disease causing mutations in these genes have mostly been studied in heterologous expression systems and we cannot be sure if the reported effects can directly be translated into native cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In our laboratory we therefore use a different approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We directly study the effects of KCNE gene deletion in isolated cardiomyocytes from knockout mice by cellular electrophysiology - a unique technique that we describe in this issue of the Journal of Visualized Experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The hearts from genetically engineered KCNE mice are rapidly excised and mounted onto a Langendorff apparatus by aortic cannulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Free Ca(2+) in the myocardium is bound by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30740">EGTA</z:chebi>, and dissociation of cardiac myocytes is then achieved by retrograde perfusion of the coronary arteries with a specialized low Ca(2+) buffer containing collagenase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Atria, free right ventricular wall and the left ventricle can then be separated by microsurgical techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Calcium is then slowly added back to isolated cardiomyocytes in a multiple step comprising washing procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes of healthy appearance with no spontaneous contractions are then immediately subjected to electrophysiological analyses by patch clamp technique or other biochemical analyses within the first 6 hours following isolation </plain></SENT>
