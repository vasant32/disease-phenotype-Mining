<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Despite the publication and dissemination of the Advanced Cardiac Life Support guidelines, variability in the use of drugs during resuscitation from out-of-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> may exist between different Emergency Medical Services throughout North America </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to characterize the use of such drugs and evaluate their relationship to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Registry-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>Cardiac Arrest</z:hpo> collects out-of-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> data from 264 Emergency Medical Services agencies in 11 geographical locations in the U.S. and Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association between drug use, characteristics of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> and a pulse at emergency department arrival and survival to discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 16,221 out-of-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrests</z:hpo> were attended by 74 Emergency Medical Services agencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a considerable variability in the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> for the treatment of shock resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For non-shockable rhythms, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> use ranged from 29 to 95% and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="32139">sodium bicarbonate</z:chebi> use ranged from 0.2 to 73% across agencies in the 89% of agencies that used the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">Epinephrine</z:chebi> use ranged from 57 to 98% within agencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> nor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> was associated with a survival benefit while there was an inverse relationship between the administration of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="32139">sodium bicarbonate</z:chebi> and survival to hospital discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable variability among Emergency Medical Services agencies in their use of pharmacological therapy for out-of-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrests</z:hpo> which may be resolved by performing large randomized trials examining effects on survival </plain></SENT>
