<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the electrogram characteristics that indicate procedural AF termination during continuous complex fractionated electrogram ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-two consecutive patients with persistent AF (47 men; aged 54 ± 9 years), who underwent electrogram-based catheter ablation in the left atrium and coronary sinus after pulmonary vein isolation, were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The intracardiac bipolar atrial electrogram recordings were characterized by (1) fractionation interval (FI) analysis (&gt;6 seconds), (2) kurtosis (shape of the FI histogram), and (3) skewness (asymmetry of the FI histogram) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sites showing complex, fractionated electrograms (mean FI ≤ 60 ms) were targeted, and AF was terminated in 20 patients (38%) after the pulmonary vein isolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The conventional complex fractionated electrogram sites (mean ≤ 120 ms) in patients with AF termination exhibited higher median kurtosis (2.69 [interquartile range, 2.03-3.46] versus 2.35 [interquartile range, 1.79-2.48]; P=0.024) and higher complex fractionated electrogram-mean interval (102.7 ± 19.8 versus 87.7 ± 15.0; P=0.008) than patients without AF termination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, AF termination sites had higher median kurtosis than targeted sites without AF termination (5.13 [interquartile range, 3.51-6.47] versus 4.18 [interquartile range, 2.91-5.34]; P&lt;0.01) in patients with procedural termination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients with AF termination had a higher sinus rhythm maintenance rate after a single procedure than patients without AF termination (log-rank test, P=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A kurtosis analysis using the FI histogram may be a useful tool in identifying the critical substrate for persistent AF and potential responders to catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
