<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We assessed the relation between female sex and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi>-eluting stent (SES) use on long-term outcomes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There are no data on sex-specific differences in long-term benefit of SES use compared with bare-metal stent (BMS) use among patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a post hoc analysis of the MULTISTRATEGY trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios (HRs) of events with 95% CI for sex and stent type were computed using Cox proportional regression with adjustment for confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 744 patients, 64 years old (55-73 years old), 179 (24.1%) women, were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a follow-up of 1,080 days, SES use was associated with a significant reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events, that is, the composite of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, reinfarction, or clinically driven target vessel revascularization (TVR) (13.9% vs 23.6%, adjusted HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41-0.94, P = .026) and of TVR (6.1% vs 15.1%, adjusted HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.19-0.63, P &lt; .001) in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, SES use was not associated to a better outcome among women (major adverse cardiovascular events 21.9% in SES vs 18.2% in the BMS group, adjusted HR 1.27, 95% CI 0.53-3.02, P = .59; TVR 6.6% vs 9.1%, adjusted HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.17-2.21, P = .46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis, the clinical benefit of SES use, over BMS, at 3-year follow-up was restricted to men and was not observed among women </plain></SENT>
