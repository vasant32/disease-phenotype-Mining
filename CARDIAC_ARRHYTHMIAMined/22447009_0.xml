<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nicorandil, a hybrid compound of a <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>-channel opener and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50566">nitric oxide donor</z:chebi>, has been reported to improve the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to evaluate the effect of intravenous nicorandil on the mid-term prognosis of AHFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 402 consecutive patients who were hospitalized for AHFS were divided into 2 groups according to the use of intravenous nicorandil: 78 patients in the Nicorandil group and 324 patients in the Control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the 180-day follow-up, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or rehospitalization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> occurred in 7 patients in the Nicorandil group (9.0%) and in 75 patients (23.2%) in the Control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Event-free survival rates were significantly higher in the Nicorandil group than in the Control group (P=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox hazard analysis revealed that age (hazard ratio (HR)=1.066, P&lt;0.0001), systolic blood pressure (HR=0.983, P=0.0023), New York Heart Association class III/IV (HR=6.550, P&lt;0.0001), log <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> (HR=3.866, P=0.0106), and use of intravenous nicorandil (HR=0.179, P&lt;0.0001) were significant predictive factors for the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or rehospitalization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous nicorandil treatment from the urgent phase of AHFS may improve the prognosis </plain></SENT>
