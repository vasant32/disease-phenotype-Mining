<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite significant progress in the understanding, the mechanisms and pathophysiology of AF treatments are often unsatisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This in part may be related to the complexity of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, as well as its evolution overtime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> has many aetiologies and underlying causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The anti-arrhythmic drugs (AADs) and interventions aimed at controlling AF should therefore be based on aetiology and associated conditions, rather than electrophysiological mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The current guideline in the management of AF in most part is based on safety and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This review will discuss the approach to management, based on primary prevention of AF with the aim to target at risk factors, triggers, specific substrates related to aetiology rather than mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The development of new pharmacological agents and therapeutic strategies should consider not only evidence based, but also include patient-specific personalized context system biology and pharmacology; otherwise, we will continue to see moderate drug efficacy at best and negative results and outcomes </plain></SENT>
