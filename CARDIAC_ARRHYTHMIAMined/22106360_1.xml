<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present analysis aimed to evaluate the importance of baseline PQ-interval and percentage of ventricular pacing (VP) on AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed data on AF during follow-up in 1415 patients included in the DANPACE trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a subgroup of 650 patients with DDDR pacemaker, we studied whether %VP, baseline PQ-interval, and programmed atrio-ventricular interval (AVI) was associated with AF burden measured as time in mode-switch (MS) detected by the pacemaker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the entire DANPACE study population, the incidence of AF was significantly higher in patients with baseline PQ-interval &gt;180 ms (P&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 650 patients with DDDR pacemaker, telemetry data were available for 1.337 ± 786 days, %VP was 66 ± 33%, AF was detected at planned follow-up in 160 patients (24.6%), MS occurred in 422 patients (64.9%), and AF burden was marginally higher with baseline PQ-interval &gt;180 ms (P= 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant association was detected between %VP and %MS (Spearman's ρ 0.056, P= 0.154). %MS was not different between minimal-paced programmed AVI ≤ 100 and &gt;100 ms (median value), respectively (P= 0.60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that a longer baseline PQ-interval is associated with an increased risk of AF in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011704'>sick sinus syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> burden is not associated with the percentage of VP or the length of the programmed AVI </plain></SENT>
