<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was hypothesized that blunted "fight or flight" responses to stress (i.e., blunted HRR, SCR, and RSA withdrawal) would be associated with relational <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo>, whereas heightened "fight or flight" responses (i.e., heightened HRR, SCR, and RSA withdrawal) would be associated with physical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, it was hypothesized that heightened "fight or flight" responses would interact with social and cognitive risk factors in the prediction of physical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were collected at an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-girls residential summer camp (mean age=12.47 years; N=119) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, findings indicated that blunted "fight or flight" was associated with relational <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> whereas heightened "fight or flight" was associated with physical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo>, particularly in the context of high social and cognitive risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings contribute to our understanding of the relationship between physiological reactivity and different forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> in girls </plain></SENT>
