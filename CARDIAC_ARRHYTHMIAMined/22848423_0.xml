<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inactivation gating, involving a conformational change at the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> selectivity filter, has recently been recognized as a major <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channel regulatory mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channel hERG, inactivation controls the length of the human cardiac action potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations impairing hERG inactivation cause life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, which also occur as undesired side effects of drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we report atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, complemented by mutational and electrophysiological studies, which suggest that the selectivity filter adopts a collapsed conformation in the inactivated state of hERG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The selectivity filter is gated by an intricate hydrogen bond network around residues S620 and N629 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutations of this hydrogen bond network are shown to cause inactivation deficiency in electrophysiological measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, drug-related conformational changes around the central cavity and pore helix provide a functional mechanism for newly discovered hERG activators </plain></SENT>
