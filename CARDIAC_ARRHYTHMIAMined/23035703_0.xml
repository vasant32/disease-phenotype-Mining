<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Whether procedural termination of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is necessary for optimal clinical efficacy still remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to characterize the patients with persistent AF in whom procedural AF termination impacted an improved clinical outcome after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively assessed 132 patients (61.0 ± 9.3 years, 114 males) undergoing catheter ablation of persistent AF (duration 3 years, median) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A stepwise ablation approach including pulmonary vein isolation and atrial substrate ablation targeting complex fractionated and high-frequency electrograms was performed with desired endpoint of AF termination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 90 patients (68%) were free from recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> at 20 ± 11 months of follow-up after one or two procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The left atrial diameter and continuous AF duration according to medical history were associated with the outcome (P = 0.002 and P&lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate Cox regression analysis, the continuous AF duration was the only independent predictor of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (hazard ratio 1.17, 95% confidence interval 1.10-1.23, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with AF duration of ≥ 3 years, the clinical success was comparable regardless of whether AF termination was achieved or not (log-rank, P = 0.27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the remaining patients with AF duration of &lt;3 years, procedural AF termination was associated with a higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-free rate than when AF was sustained after ablation (log-rank, P = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Extensive ablation to terminate AF might not be warranted in patients with a longer AF duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, procedural AF termination could be associated with maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with a shorter AF duration with a less proarrhythmic substrate </plain></SENT>
