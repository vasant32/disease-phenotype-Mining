<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exercise-stress test is the first-line approach to diagnose suspected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to elucidate the value of exercise-stress test for predicting mutations and future cardiac events in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e>-family relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The present study included 67 asymptomatic relatives (24 ± 15 years) of 17 genetically positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> probands, who underwent exercise-stress test without any medication and genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exercise-stress test, which was considered positive with the induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> consisting of bigeminy or couplets, was positive in 17 relatives (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genetic analysis disclosed mutations in 16 of these 17 relatives (94%) and in 16 of the 50 relatives (32%) with negative exercise-stress test; the sensitivity and specificity for a positive genotype were 50 and 97%, respectively (P&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 32 mutation carriers, cardiac events occurred in 7 of the 16 relatives with positive and 2 of the 16 relatives with negative exercise-stress test during the follow-up period of 9.6 ± 3.8 years, and four with positive and two with negative stress test were not on regular beta-blocker treatment at these events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 16 relatives with positive stress test, those on beta-blocker treatment demonstrated a trend of lower cardiac event rate (Log-rank P= 0.054) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In asymptomatic relatives of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> probands, exercise-stress test can be used as a simple diagnostic tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, because of the low sensitivity for predicting mutations and future cardiac events in those with negative stress test, genetic analysis should be performed to improve patient management </plain></SENT>
