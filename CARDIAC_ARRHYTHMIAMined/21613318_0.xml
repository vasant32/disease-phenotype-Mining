<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While the effect of cigarette smoking on the progression of atherosclerotic diseases is established and well studied, the role of cigarette smoking on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> is less clearly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In fact the pathophysiological mechanism of cigarette smoking-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> is very likely a complex one where the pro-fibrotic effect of <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> on myocardial tissue with consequent increased susceptibility to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> might play a role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, other constituents of cigarette smoking, such as <z:chebi fb="168" ids="17245">carbon monoxide</z:chebi> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, are likely to contribute to the generation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, cigarette smoking may induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo>, which also might cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The objective of this paper is to summarize the published studies relating to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> induced by cigarette smoking, and to identify a pathophysiological mechanism by which cigarette smoking might induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
