<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively evaluated the charts of 27 patients with multiple venous access failure who had intra-atrial dialysis catheter placement between October 2005 and October 2010 in our clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Permanent right atrial dialysis catheters were placed through a right anterior mini-thoracotomy under intratracheal general anesthesia in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographics of the cases, the patency rates of hemodialysis via atrial catheterization, existence of any catheter <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and catheter-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were documented and used in statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventeen women (63%) and 10 men (37%) with the mean age of 59.0 ± 7.1 years (47-71) were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>Chronic renal failure</z:hpo> was diagnosed for the mean of 78.9 ± 24.3 months (33-130) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five patients (18.5%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>Ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> were the causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the early postoperative period in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two of the remaining three patients died because of cerebrovascular events, and one patient died because of an unknown cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (37%) had been using anticoagulate agents (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>) because of concomitant disorders such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo>, operated valve disease, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Catheter <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and malfunction was determined in three cases (11.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Intra-atrial hemodialysis catheterization is a safe and effective life-saving measure for the patients with multiple venous failure and without any possibility of peritoneal dialysis or renal transplantation </plain></SENT>
