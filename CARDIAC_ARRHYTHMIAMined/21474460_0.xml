<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Patients with interatrial conduction delay may have suboptimal left atrioventricular (AV) timing due to delayed contraction of the left atrium with foreshortening of ventricular filling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This may be an issue in pacemaker patients, especially those requiring resychronization therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pacing from the high interatrial septum (IAS) or the distal or proximal coronary sinus (CSD and CSP) may improve left AV synchrony compared with pacing from the right atrial appendage (RAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to compare haemodynamics of these pacing sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 24 patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Left atrial pressures were recorded in sinus rhythm, and during pacing from the RAA, IAS, CSD, CSP, and with biatrial (BiA) pacing from the IAS + CSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Amplitudes, +dP/dT(max), and timing of the a-wave were compared between recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Left atrial contractility, measured by +dP/dT(max), was greatest during BiA pacing (P ≤ 0.03 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a marked reduction in delay to peak a-wave when pacing from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sites compared with the RAA, with BiA pacing yielding the shortest delay (P ≤ 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, AV conduction was shortened by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> alternative pacing sites, which mitigated the anticipation of left atrial contraction with respect to ventricular activation, except for BiA pacing (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pacing of the IAS did not result in any improvement in haemodynamics or AV synchrony </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Multisite atrial pacing results in favourable <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> atrial haemodynamics and left AV synchrony </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This may be a solution in pacemaker patients with interatrial conduction delay </plain></SENT>
