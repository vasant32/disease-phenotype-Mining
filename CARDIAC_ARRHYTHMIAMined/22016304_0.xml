<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">Verapamil</z:chebi>-sensitive idiopathic left <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (ILVT) combined with a left accessory pathway (AP) is a relatively rare condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examines the characteristics of patients with this condition and the effect of radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Catheter ablation was performed on 140 ILVT patients at a single centre from January 2004 to December 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A concealed left AP was found in seven patients (5%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom were male, with an average age of 21 ± 9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sustained ILVT and orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AVRT) were induced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Retrograde activation through a bystander AP occurred concomitantly with ILVT, with an average <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> length of 346 ± 29 ms (range 310-400 ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The location of the APs in four patients was left posterior, two of which showed a slow and decremental property, while in three it was left lateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ablation via a retrograde transaortic approach was performed in the seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The left AP was ablated first in six patients, but ILVT was no longer induced in one and became non-sustained in another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the seventh patient, ILVT was ablated first and this proved successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with IVLT, 5% had a concomitant left AP, most of who were young men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The location of the left AP was mainly posterior and lateral, with 30% showing a slow and decremental property </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Idiopathic left <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> and AP should be ablated simultaneously </plain></SENT>
