<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Risk assessment studies use a suite of nominally independent noninvasive heart rate metrics, often brought together in a statistical model to compute a risk score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ongoing need to noninvasively identify the higher risk patients requiring more invasive investigations/interventions drives the search for better noninvasive predictive metrics, with increased sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many varieties of autoregulatory malfunction occur within the cardiovascular system; thus, it seems a daunting challenge to build predictive models that account for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> potential modes of failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Auto-entrainment (AE) methodology was developed to help address this challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: AE methodology tests intrinsic capacity to maintain a stable and coherent oscillatory dynamic of autoregulatory control via respiratory entrainment of the blood pressure and heart period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (n=18) at follow-up (1.5 years) as the end point, analysis of AE measurements from 148 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> revealed 2 parameters significantly predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using logistic regression, the magnitude of systolic pulsus alternans measured during AE had predictive sensitivity of 90% (confidence interval, 62%-100% and specificity of 62% (confidence interval, 49%-74%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The capacity to maintain a stable oscillatory dynamic was measured by the fraction of the total RR-interval spectral power contained within the AE-band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This capacity had predictive sensitivity of 73% (confidence interval, 47%-99%) and specificity of 55% (confidence interval, 43%-66%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AE methodology provides a noninvasive platform to assess the integrity of cardiovascular autoregulatory control systems for risk assessment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
