<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Electric isolation of the pulmonary veins and posterior left atrium with a single ring of radiofrequency lesions (single-ring isolation [SRI]) may result in fewer <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) recurrences than wide antral pulmonary vein isolation (wide antral isolation [WAI]) by abolishing extravenous AF triggers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of mitral isthmus line (MIL) ablation on outcomes after SRI has not previously been assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We randomly assigned 220 consecutive patients (58 ± 10 years old; 82% men) with highly symptomatic AF (61% paroxysmal, 39% persistent/longstanding persistent) to undergo either SRI or WAI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Half of each cohort was also randomly allocated to have left lateral MIL ablation (2 ��2 factorial study design) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed clinically and with 7-day Holter studies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary end points were recurrence of AF and organized atrial tachyarrhythmias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AF-free survival at 2 years was better after SRI (74% [95% CI, 65%-82%]) than WAI (61% [51%-70%]; P=0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Organized atrial tachyarrhythmia-free survival was similar after SRI and WAI (67% [57%-75%] ersus 64% [54%-72%], respectively, at 2 years; P=0.988) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MIL ablation resulted in better 2-year organized atrial tachyarrhythmia-free survival (71% [62%-79%] versus 60% [50%-69%]; P=0.07), which approached statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Survival free of any atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> after one procedure was not significantly affected by isolation technique or MIL ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions- SRI resulted in fewer AF recurrences compared with WAI on long-term follow-up but did not reduce the recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MIL ablation may reduce organized atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrences </plain></SENT>
