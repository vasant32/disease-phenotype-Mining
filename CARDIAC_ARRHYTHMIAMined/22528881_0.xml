<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the effects of a range of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35469">antidepressant drugs</z:chebi> on the heart of gestation day 13 rat embryos in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The general hypothesis was that the drugs would adversely affect the function of the embryonic heart since they <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> have some cardiac ion channel blocking activity in addition to their main pharmacological effect on <z:chebi fb="65" ids="25512">neurotransmitters</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the tested drugs caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> in a generally concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At higher concentrations most of the drugs caused some degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>heart block</z:hpo> consistent with <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel blockade and some drugs also showed negative inotropy associated with blockade of the L-type calcium channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One drug, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9654">trazodone</z:chebi>, caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> consistent with blockade of the hERG (human <z:chebi fb="91" ids="25698">ether</z:chebi>-a-go-go related gene) <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In general the effects on the embryonic rat heart were only seen at "free drug" concentrations much greater than those likely to occur in pregnant women taking antidepressant medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The least margin of safety was seen with the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="36809">tricyclic antidepressants</z:chebi> and the <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> and reuptake inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9654">trazodone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
