<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 29-year-old male was admitted to our outpatient clinic because of palpitation and documented narrow QRS <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on the ECG, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> was diagnosed, electrophysiological examination was indicated and ablation therapy was recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During positioning of the catheter the patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the coronary sinus catheter the activation spread from distal to proximal electrodes, suggesting left atrial origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During atrial entrainment pacing long return cycle was observed and distal coronary sinus pacing resulted in a 15 ms longer cycle length than the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the left atrial origin of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was confirmed and double transseptal puncture was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lasso and irrigated tip catheter were introduced into the left atrium and electroanatomical mapping was performed with CARTO3 system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After electroanatomical mapping the origin of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> was located proximally in the left superior pulmonary vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ablation was started at the earliest activation point, where acceleration was observed and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> stopped after the first ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary vein isolation was completed, and bidirectional block could be confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After 30 minutes the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was not inducible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, Holter-examination was negative and the patient remained asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The pulmonary vein <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> that can occur at any age, but the diagnosis based on the ECG is not always simple </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Detailed electroanatomical mapping is very important in the diagnosis of this type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, although it can be verified with conventional electrophysiological methods as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Focal ablation may be a therapeutic option; however, total isolation of pulmonary veins can be more effective </plain></SENT>
