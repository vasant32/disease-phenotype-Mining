<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Stimulation of the intra-cardiac vagal nerves innervating the AV-node (AVNS) is a promising approach to slow down ventricular rate (VR) during <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to demonstrate that effects on R-R-interval during stable AF can be maintained for several months once optimized and that AVNS affects specifically the nerves innervating the AV-node </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our study included both an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen goats were implanted with a pacemaker connected to an atrial and ventricular lead and a neurostimulator connected to an atrial lead placed at a certain septal site, to induce an AV prolongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> experiments (n = 9), after assessment of optimal AVNS parameters, the effect of continuous AVNS on VR was studied during stable AF for up to 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of AVNS was studied using <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> and esmolol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Next, the effects of AVNS during the atrial refractory period on electrophysiological and hemodynamic parameters were investigated acutely (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The maximal effect was found at a stimulation frequency of 40 Hz, and increased with increasing pulse width (at lower voltages) and increasing voltage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 0, 1, and 3 months of AVNS during stable AF, AVNS decreased average VR, respectively, 55% (n = 9), 48% (n = 8), and 28% (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The AVNS effect appeared to be dominantly parasympathetic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>AVNS did not influence (1) the sinus node, (2) the refractory period of the atrial, ventricular tissue, and His and (3) hemodynamic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: AVNS is efficient in reducing ventricular rate for at least 3 months using optimized parameters and specifically affects the parasympathetic nerves innervating the AV-node </plain></SENT>
