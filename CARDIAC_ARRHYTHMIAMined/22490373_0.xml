<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> during CPR on the myocardium is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> during simulated CPR reduces the restoration of the myocardial energy state and contractile function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Twelve porcine hearts were isolated and perfused with the pig's own blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First, cardiac oxygen consumption was measured by blood gas analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondly, we simulated sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> (7 min <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>, zero flow) followed by simulated CPR (7 min, 0.3 mL/g/min perfusion rate) in the absence and presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> [six hearts were maintained in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>-group), six were defibrillated (defib-group)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> increased the cardiac oxygen consumption by 71% (0.87 ± 0.12 vs. 1.49 ± 0.14 μmol O₂/g/min; mean ± <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>, P&lt; 0.001) compared with a ventricular rhythm of 62 beats/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> during simulated CPR after 7 min of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> hampered restoration of myocardial <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi>-phosphate levels compared with defibrillated hearts (61 ± 9 vs. 87 ± 7% of baseline values, respectively; P&lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cardiac contractile function was significantly higher in the defib- than in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>-group (area under the pressure curve 2.29 ± 0.22 vs. 1.72 ± 0.14 s×mm Hg respectively; P&lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the cardiac oxygen consumption is increased by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> and that the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> during CPR hampers the restoration of the myocardial energy state and contractility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Strategies that reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> duration without disrupting chest compressions will benefit the restoration of the cardiac energy state during resuscitations </plain></SENT>
