<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Current definition of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (PAF) enrolls a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> population with different <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) exposure and degree of atrial substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Study aims were to evaluate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and long-term results of electrical cardioversion (ECV) and to identify temporal cutoff of previous AF exposure to reclassify PAF in subgroups with different chance of sinus rhythm (SR) maintenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five hundred twenty-one patients (66% men; age 69 ± 10 years) with PAF undergoing ECV, were divided in four groups according to AF duration at the time of ECV: group A with AF ≤2 months (141 patients); group B with AF &gt;2 and ≤4 months (176 patients); group C with AF &gt;4 and ≤6 months (89 patients); and group D with AF &gt;6 months and &lt;1 year (115 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no difference in term of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> success among groups (98.5% vs 97.1% vs 98.9% vs 96.5%, respectively, P = 0.95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 5-year follow-up, 198 (41%) patients were in SR: 50% in group A, 44% in group B, 42% in group C, and 25% in group D (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the multivariate analysis, previous ECV (hazard ratio [HR] 1.55, P &lt; 0.001), left atrium enlargement (HR 1.39, P = 0.013), and AF duration &gt;6 months at time of procedure (HR 1.59, P = 0.001) independently predict ECV failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ECV is associated with high <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> success rate and low complications rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Long-term results are strongly related with AF duration at time of ECV: a cutoff of &gt;6 months helps in selecting patients that can take greater advantage of the procedure </plain></SENT>
