<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have been conducted regarding a heartbeat classification algorithm over the past several decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, many algorithms have also been studied to acquire robust performance, as biosignals have a large amount of variation among individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Various methods have been proposed to reduce the differences coming from personal characteristics, but these expand the differences caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this paper, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> classification algorithm using a dedicated wavelet adapted to individual subjects is proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We reduced the performance variation using dedicated wavelets, as in the ECG <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphologies</z:mp> of the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proposed algorithm utilizes morphological filtering and a continuous wavelet transform with a dedicated wavelet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis were utilized to compress the morphological data transformed by the dedicated wavelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An extreme learning machine was used as a classifier in the proposed algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A performance evaluation was conducted with the <z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi>-BIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results showed a high sensitivity of 97.51%, specificity of 85.07%, accuracy of 97.94%, and a positive predictive value of 97.26% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The proposed algorithm achieves better accuracy than other state-of-the-art algorithms with no intrasubject between the training and evaluation datasets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>And it significantly reduces the amount of intervention needed by physicians </plain></SENT>
