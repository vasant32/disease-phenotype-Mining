<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: -Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is associated with a transient increased risk of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that dabigatran can be safely used as an alternative to continuous <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> for the peri-procedural anticoagulation in PVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: -999 consecutive patients undergoing PVI were included; 376 patients were on dabigatran (150 mg) and 623 were on <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> with therapeutic INR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dabigatran was held 1 to 2 doses prior to PVI and restarted at the conclusion of the procedure or as soon as patients were transferred to the nursing floor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Propensity score matching was applied to generate a cohort of 344 patients in each group with balanced baseline data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total hemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications were similar in both groups, before (3.2% vs 3.9%; p = 0.59), and after (3.2% vs 4.1%; p = 0.53) matching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> occurred in 1.1% vs 1.6% (p = 0.48) before, and 1.2% vs 1.5% (p = 0.74) after matching in the dabigatran vs <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> group respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A single thromboembolic event occurred in each of the dabigatran and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite higher doses of intra-procedural <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, the mean ACT was significantly lower in patients who held dabigatran for 1 or 2 doses than those on <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: -Our study found no evidence to suggest a higher risk of thromboembolic or hemorrhagic complications with use of dabigatran for peri-procedural anticoagulation in patients undergoing PVI compared to uninterrupted <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
