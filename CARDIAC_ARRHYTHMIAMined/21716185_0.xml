<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine a relationship between QT interval prolongation and metabolic homoeostasis, and durations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1563921" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cold ischemia</z:e> time (CIT) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1567664" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">warm ischemia</z:e> time (WIT) during renal transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL/METHODS: From among 198 consecutive renal transplant patients, 68 (mean age 45 Â± 12 years) were included in a prospective observational pilot study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prior to the procedure, arterial blood gas analysis was performed, and digital Holter ECG monitoring was applied and continued for 12 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequent arterial blood gas analysis was performed 30 minutes after graft reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: QTc changed dynamically and significantly during the perioperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>Ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> were observed only during graft reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recordings showed that 33 out of 68 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>ventricular extrasystoles</z:hpo>, and non-sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> was observed in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No patients presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemodynamic instability</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical correlation between CIT or WIT and the difference (delta) between the final and initial values of the pH, <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> levels, QTc range, maximal QTc or QTc measured at the predefined time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The renal transplantation procedure carries a high risk of ventricular repolarization period disturbances that can lead to life-threatening tachyarrhythmias despite optimal hemodynamic or metabolic status and independent of CIT and WIT </plain></SENT>
