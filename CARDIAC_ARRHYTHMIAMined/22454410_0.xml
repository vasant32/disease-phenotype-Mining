<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In conventional dual-chamber pacing the position of the atrial lead could influence duration of the atrio-ventricular (AV) intervals, which is one of the variables that could be associated with an increased percentage of RV pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We wanted to see if lead placement at selected atrial septal sites could reduce AV intervals in patients receiving a dual-chamber pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a prospective, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, randomized single centre study that enrolled 57 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The atrial lead was placed in both the right atrial appendage (RAA) and the lower atrial septum (LAS) in each patient in random order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The P-wave durations, PR intervals, A sense-V sense (As-Vs), and A pace-V sense (Ap-Vs) intervals were measured at both atrial lead locations in each patient during device implant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The P-wave durations during sinus rhythm (SR), RAA pacing, and LAS pacing were 113 ± 19, 144 ± 27, and 84 ± 12 ms (RAA vs. LAS, P &lt; 0.001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The PR intervals during SR, RAA pacing, and LAS pacing were 195 ± 47, 230 ± 61, and 167 ± 44 ms (RAA vs. LAS, P &lt; 0.001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The As-Vs interval was 31% shorter in LAS pacing than in RAA pacing (134 ± 44 ms vs. 194 ± 52 ms, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Ap-Vs interval was 24% shorter during LAS pacing than during RAA pacing (195 ± 45 ms vs. 257 ± 63 ms, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: When compared with RAA pacing, LAS pacing was associated with a shorter P wave duration, PR interval, As-Vs, and Ap-Vs intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The potential long-term impact of the strategy of pacing from LAS in reducing unnecessary RV pacing needs to be explored in future studies </plain></SENT>
