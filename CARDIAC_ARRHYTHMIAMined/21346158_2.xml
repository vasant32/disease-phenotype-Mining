<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> (LQTS) are susceptible to an episodic malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmia known as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsade de pointes</z:hpo>, which can result in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients can suffer severe cardiac events resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> during times of physical and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086209" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">emotional stress</z:e> and when exposed to certain drugs including <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anesthetics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe the occurrence of perioperative adverse events (AEs) related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in children with congenital LQTS exposed to volatile general anesthesia and describe associated risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of children with LQTS undergoing general anesthesia for noncardiac surgery or device implant, or revision for cardiac rhythm management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study was a retrospective chart review with data collection from computerized and electronic patient medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-six patients with congenital LQTS were identified who had a total of 114 anesthetic encounters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 114 anesthetic encounters, there were 3 AEs, 2 definite and 1 probable AE, for an incidence of 2.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The events occurred in boys (aged 11, 13, and 15 years) while undergoing noncardiac surgery under volatile general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were receiving Î²-blocker therapy preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The AEs occurred in close proximity to the administration of reversal drugs (anticholinesterase/anticholinergic combinations) and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50919">antiemetic</z:chebi> ondansetron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The events occurred during emergence from anesthesia, and exclusively in the group of patients who received both reversal drugs and ondansetron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were treated successfully with short-term antiarrhythmic drug therapy and discharged the next morning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is an increased risk of AEs during periods of enhanced sympathetic activity, especially emergence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This risk seems to be further enhanced if drugs are administered at this time that are known either to prolong the corrected QT interval or the transmural dispersion of repolarization or increase the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Restriction of medications that adversely affect ion channels and intense vigilance and monitoring during this time and in the postoperative phase could help prevent occurrence or progression of AEs </plain></SENT>
