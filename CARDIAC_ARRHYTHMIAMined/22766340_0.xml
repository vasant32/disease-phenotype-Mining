<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the impact on recurrences of 2 different substrate approaches for the treatment of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Catheter ablation of electrical storms (ES) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (VAs) has shown moderate long-term efficacy in patients with ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-two consecutive patients (81% male, age 62 ± 13 years) with ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and ES underwent catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated either by confining the radiofrequency lesions to the endocardial surface with limited substrate ablation (Group 1, n = 49) or underwent endocardial and epicardial ablation of abnormal potentials within the scar (homogenization of the scar, Group 2, n = 43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Epicardial access was obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Group 2 patients, whereas epicardial ablation was performed in 33% (14) of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean ejection fraction was 27 ± 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 25 ± 10 months, the VAs recurrence rate of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VTs) was 47% (23 of 49 patients) in Group 1 and 19% (8 of 43 patients) in Group 2 (log-rank p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient in Group 1 and 1 patient in Group 2 died at follow-up for noncardiac reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that ablation using endo-epicardial homogenization of the scar significantly increases freedom from VAs in ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
