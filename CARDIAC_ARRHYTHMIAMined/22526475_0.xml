<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to evaluate whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> patients, who do not respond to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> treatment, and thereby endure persistent <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, have increased QT dispersion (QTd) values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> patients and 22 age- and sex-matched control subjects were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Repolarization and QT dispersion parameters were computed from 12-lead ECG recording using designated computer software, and results of five beats were subsequently averaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> patients and controls had similar comorbidities, similar values of average QT, average corrected QT interval length, average QTd interval, average QT corrected dispersion, QT dispersion ratio, JT dispersion (JTd), and JT corrected dispersion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> patients who were unresponsive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> treatment and did not develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> QTd and JTd parameters, indicating a non-increased risk for repolarization-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
