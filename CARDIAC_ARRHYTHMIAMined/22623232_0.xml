<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Prediction of recurrent malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias after insertion of a implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) is challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microvolt T-wave alternans (MTWA) seems to be a promising marker of such events in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess prognostic significance of MTWA and other noninvasive parameters in the prediction of major arrhythmic events after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This prospective study included 155 patients (121 male, age 59 ± 11 years) in whom <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> was implanted for secondary prevention of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, clinical evaluation along with estimation of ejection fraction, MTWA measurement using the HearTwave Cambridge Heart system, and determination of the corrected QT interval (QTc) and QT dispersion (QTd) based on resting ECG were performed 3 days before <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using 24-h Holter monitoring, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, QT interval, QT dynamicity, QT variability (QTSD) and heart rate variability (HRV) time domain parameters were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MTWA results were categorised, based on the accepted criteria, as positive, negative or indeterminate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In further analyses, positive and indeterminate MTWA results were grouped together as abnormal or non-negative tests [MTWA+], while negative MTWA results were considered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> [MTWA-] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up (mean duration 21.6 ± 11.6 months), major arrhythmic cardiac events (MACE), defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and/or the need for ablation and/or heart transplantation due to malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias, were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the follow-up, MACE occurred in 17 (11%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Abnormal MTWA before <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation was found significantly more frequently in patients with MACE as compared to patients without MACE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified abnormal MTWA and QTSD as independent risk factors for MACE, with hazard ratios of 10.82 (95% CI 9.76-11.88; p〈 0.05) and 1.08 (95% CI 1.05-1.08), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in MACE-free survival rate with regard to MTWA results (abnormal vs <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MTWA) were shown during the follow-up (p〈 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The negative predictive value of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MTWA for MACE was 98.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>When both MTWA and QTSD were combined, the positive predictive value increased to 35%, with a sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 81% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The probability of MACE with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> results of both these tests was 2.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal MTWA is a strong independent predictor of MACE in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> recipients, and QTSD is a weaker predictor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In the prediction of MACE after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation, the highest predictive value was noted for abnormal MTWA combined with QTSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> values of these two parameters were associated with a low probability of MACE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that standardised MTWA evaluation can be useful for risk stratification in the clinical practice </plain></SENT>
