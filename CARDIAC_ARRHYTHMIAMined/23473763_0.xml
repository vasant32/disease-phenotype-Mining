<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the measurement of high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) has become possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several studies have clarified that hs-TnT is a marker to indicate mortality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To examine whether hs-TnT can be used as a prognostic marker to predict the operative outcome of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 60 patients with AS (mean age=68.7±9.6 years, male/female=30/30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiac catheterization and echocardiography were performed to evaluate the severity of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aortic valve replacement surgery was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We defined major adverse cardiac events (MACE) as composite events of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We followed up the patients for 922±800 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 60.0±1.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean aortic valve area was 0.61±0.03cm(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MACE occurred in 11 patients (18%), including 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We divided the patients into three groups based on the percentile of the plasma levels of hs-TnT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier curve revealed a statistically significant difference in MACE rate among the groups (log-rank test, χ(2)=13.0, p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We conducted a Cox proportional hazard analysis with a model including age, sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and hs-TnT tertile as explanatory variables to predict MACE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We found that hs-TnT tertile to be a significant factor to predict MACE (hazard ratio: 3.71, p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: hs-TnT can be a prognostic marker for patients with AS after valve replacement surgery </plain></SENT>
