<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of intravenous ibutilide for conversion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) and flutter (AFL) to sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-nine consecutive patients aged 18-75 y with AF/AFL were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was &lt;90 d (1 h-90 d) and ventricular rate was &gt;60 beats/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were assigned randomly into two groups: 49 patients in ibutilide group received ibutilide 1 mg, then repeated if AF/AFL was not converted after 10 min; 50 patients in propafenone group received propafenone 70 mg, then repeated if AF/AFL persisted after 10 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two drugs were diluted by 50 ml of 5% <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and injected intravenously within 10 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ventricular rates were decreased in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AF/AFL were converted in 34 of 49 patients (69.4 % ) in ibutilide group and in 22 of 50 patients (44.0 %) in propafenone group (P &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The converting time of ibutilide was significantly shorter than that of propafenone [(16.79 ±12.31) min compared with (36.92 ±11.38)min, P &lt;0.01] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most serious adverse effect of ibutilide was non-sustained monomorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (3/49,6.12 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> and heart pause were the main adverse events in patients who received propafenone, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> occurred in one patient of propafenone group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intravenous ibutilide is a safe and effective agent for cardioversion of recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF/AFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore,strict processing under electrocardio-monitoring is important </plain></SENT>
