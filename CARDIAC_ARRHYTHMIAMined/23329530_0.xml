<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: "Takotsubo" <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (TTC) is a clinical disorder usually triggered by intense emotional and/or physical stress, characterized by reversible severe localized left ventricular wall <z:hpo ids='HP_0100660'>dyskinesia</z:hpo>, transient changes of ST segment, without significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242231" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary artery stenoses</z:e>, that can mimic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STATE OF THE ART: Although TTC is well known to have a good mid- and long-term prognosis, arrhythmic risk is increasingly recognized and we could provide, in view of the available literature, a mean for a prognostic stratification and some practical suggestions for management of these "vulnerable" patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PERSPECTIVES: Further studies with randomized trials will be needed to prove the optimal treatment of TTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TTC, generally considered a benign syndrome, should be reconsidered as a clinical condition at high risk for lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in a subpopulation with QTc &gt; 500 msec in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The studies about <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and TTC are based on case reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TTC may present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo>: this results in a probable underestimate of the real arrhythmic risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TTC is one of the causes of acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> and could be a trigger able to unmask latent silent or inapparent congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> factors that can exacerbate QT prolongation should be promptly removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the case of marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> and/or TdP should be implant a temporary pacemaker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In most cases, due to the transient nature of the syndrome, it is reasonable to recommend only beta-blocker therapy at discharge, despite the absence of randomized trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If there are high-risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> (QTc post-TCM &gt; 500 ms, prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrests</z:hpo>) thought should be given an indication to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implant.     </plain></SENT>
