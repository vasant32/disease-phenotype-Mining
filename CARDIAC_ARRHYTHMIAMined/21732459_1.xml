<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the suitability of two different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> thermometry sequences (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="38866,42330">TFE</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="38866,42330">TFE</z:chebi>-EPI) and three blood suppression techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experiments were performed without heating, using an optimized imaging protocol including navigator respiratory compensation, cardiac triggering, and image processing for the compensation of motion and susceptibility artefacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood suppression performance and its effect on temperature stability were evaluated in the ventricular septum of eight healthy volunteers using multislice double inversion recovery (MDIR), motion sensitized driven equilibrium (MSDE), and inflow saturation by saturation slabs (IS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was shown that blood suppression during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> thermometry improves the contrast-to-noise ratio (<z:chebi fb="11" ids="50807">CNR</z:chebi>), the robustness of the applied motion correction algorithm as well as the temperature stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A gradient echo sequence accelerated by an EPI readout and parallel imaging (SENSE) and using inflow saturation blood suppression was shown to achieve the best results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Temperature stabilities of 2 °C or better in the ventricular septum with a spatial resolution of 3.5 × 3.5 × 8mm(3) and a temporal resolution corresponding to the heart rate of the volunteer, were observed </plain></SENT>
