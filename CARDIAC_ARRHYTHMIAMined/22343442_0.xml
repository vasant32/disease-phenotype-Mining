<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Blunt chest trauma is frequently associated with cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp> and structural damage, most cases only being recognized after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a case of multiple organ trauma, where <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo>, caused by tricuspid valve rupture, was markedly delayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 21 yr old man was admitted to hospital after a car accident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He was suffering from cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, pulmonary <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp>, and a left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He also had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002757'>multiple fractures</z:hpo> of the facial bones, orbit, L4 vertebra and left tibia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He was tracheotomised, and a subdural sensor was inserted for continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>He was sedated and ventilated for two weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the 12th day, his jaw was reconstructed, and immediately after surgery, mild signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> were observed, which were attributed to cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two weeks after admission, the patient was weaned from the ventilator, and three days later, his facial bones were reconstructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four days later, the signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> reappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transoesophageal echocardiography revealed rupture of a head of papillary muscle, with 4th degree <z:hpo ids='HP_0005180'>tricuspid insufficiency</z:hpo> and enlargement of the right ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The ruptured muscle was reconstructed under extracorporeal circulation, and the patient made a satisfactory recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0006044'>tricuspid valve insufficiency</z:mp>, albeit rare, may occur in patients with blunt chest trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Sedation and lack of physical activity may delay the definite diagnosis, especially when only transthoracic echocardiography is used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, diastolic murmur, or signs of congestive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> in a chest trauma patient may <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> suggest some structural damage; therefore, transoesophageal echocardiography should be performed as early as possible in such situations </plain></SENT>
