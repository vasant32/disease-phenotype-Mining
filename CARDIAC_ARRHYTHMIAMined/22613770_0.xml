<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Continuing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> use, failure to control <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> and poor clinical progress may require thyroidectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to evaluate patients' post-operative development and mid-term outcome after thyroidectomy for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyrotoxicosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Prospective case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary care centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We prospectively collected cases of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyrotoxicosis</z:e> requiring thyroidectomy due to failure of antithyroid treatment, despite <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> discontinuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Post-thyroidectomy complications were compared immediately, 30 days and one year post-operatively, and also for scheduled versus emergency surgery cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 11 total cases, nine scheduled thyroidectomy cases had no morbidity after elective surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two cases required emergency surgery for multiple organ failure and cardiac problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immediate post-operative complications (mostly haemodynamic) occurred in both cases (emergency vs routine surgery, p = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In such cases, pre-operative medical treatment is vital to limit peri- and post-operative complications, but surgery should not be delayed if the haemodynamic status deteriorates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Surgery, with careful anaesthesia, is the cornerstone of the treatment </plain></SENT>
