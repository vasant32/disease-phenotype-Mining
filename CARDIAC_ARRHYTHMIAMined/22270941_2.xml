<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Due to their transient nature, spontaneous terminations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) are difficult to investigate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Apparently, confounding experimental findings about the time scale of this phenomenon have been reported, with values ranging from 1 s to 1 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We propose a biophysical modeling approach to study the mechanisms of spontaneous termination in two models of AF with different levels of dynamical complexity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>8 s preceding spontaneous terminations were studied and the evolution of cycle length and wavefront propagation were documented to assess the time scale and anatomical location of the phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that termination mechanisms are dependent on the underlying complexity of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During simulated AF of low complexity, the total process of spontaneous termination lasted 3,200 ms and was triggered in the left atrium 800 ms earlier than in the right atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The last fibrillatory activity was observed more often in the right atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These asymmetric termination mechanisms in both time and space were not observed during spontaneous terminations of complex AF simulations, which showed less predictable termination patterns lasting only 1,600 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study contributes to the interpretation of previous clinical observations, and illustrates how computer modeling provides a complementary approach to study the mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
