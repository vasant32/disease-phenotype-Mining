<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To compare image quality of coronary CT angiography in step-and-shoot mode at the diastolic phase at low heart rates (&lt;70 bpm) and systolic phase at high heart rates (≥70 bpm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively included 96 consecutive patients then excluded 5 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Coronary CT-angiography was performed using a dual-source 128-slice CT machine, at the diastolic phase in the 55 patients with heart rates &lt;70 bpm (group D) and at the systolic phase in the 36 patients with heart rates ≥70 (group S) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Image quality was scored on a 5 point-scale (1, not interpretable; 2, insufficient for diagnosis; 3, fair, sufficient for diagnosis; 4, good; 5, excellent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we compared the number of stair-step artifacts in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean image quality score was 4 (0.78) in group D and 4.1 (0.34) in group S (NS), with an unequal distribution (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Step artifacts were seen in 44 % of group D and 18 % of group S patients (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 3 group D patients and no group S patients, the image score was &lt;3 due to artifacts, requiring repeat CT-angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When performing dual-source 128-slice CT-angiography, step-and-shoot acquisition provides comparable mean image quality in systole, with less variability and fewer stair-step artifacts, compared to diastole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This method may be feasible at any heart rate in most patients in sinus rhythm, allowing low-dose prospective acquisition without beta-blocker premedication </plain></SENT>
