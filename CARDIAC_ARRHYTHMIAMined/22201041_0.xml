<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OPINION STATEMENT: Using an implantable cardiac monitor (ICM) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) allows continuous electrocardiogram monitoring and provides a much more detailed picture of the incidence of brady- and tachyarrhythmias than conventional follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CARISMA study was the first to use the ICM in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856742" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">post-MI</z:e> patients with moderate to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) events lasting longer than 30 s were associated with an almost threefold increase in the risk of major cardiac events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This confirms the current definition of clinically significant AF episodes, as patients with episodes of shorter duration were not at increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association of AF to progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, reinfarction, and cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> underlines the need for an intensive follow-up of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856742" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">post-MI</z:e> patients with new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF in order to reveal underlying causes of AF such as progressive left ventricular dysfunction or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic, especially nightly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> episodes including high-degree 2°-3° atrioventricular (AV) block, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001688'>sinus bradycardia</z:hpo>, and sinus arrest were frequently documented by ICM in the CARISMA study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten percent of patients experienced high-degree 2°-3° <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp>, of which the main part was nightly and asymptomatic, and 50% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred in this group, most from severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856742" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">post-MI</z:e> patients with paroxysmal high-degree <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp>, pacemaker implantation should be done, and in the case of left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF ≤ 35%), an implantable cardioverter defibrillator/cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>/CRT-D) may be indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nonsustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) is very frequent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856742" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">post-MI</z:e> patients, and in the CARISMA study, high-risk patients with nonsustained VT were implanted with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in 10% of the patients, the ICM recorded nonsustained VT episodes of ≥ 16 beats per minute, resulting in a twofold increase in the risk for cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, patients with nonsustained VT should undergo careful investigation, and we recommend a repeat echocardiography and electrophysiological stimulation in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with sustained VT or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> should receive an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
