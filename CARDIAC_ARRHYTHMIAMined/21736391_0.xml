<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because several studies have suggested that changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> may contribute to AF, we developed a novel proteomic workflow focused on the identification of differentially expressed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> proteins in AF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Right human atrial tissue was collected from 20 patients, 10 with and 10 without AF, and the tissue was subjected to hydrostatic pressure cycling-based lysis followed by label-free mass spectrometric (MS) analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> enriched isolates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Approximately 5% of the 700 proteins identified by MS analysis were differentially expressed between the AF and non-AF samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We chose four differentially abundant proteins for further verification using reverse phase protein microarray analysis based on their known importance in energy production and regulatory association with atrial ion channels: four and a half LIM, destrin, heat shock protein 2, and chaperonin-containing TCP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These initial study results provide evidence that a workflow to identify AF-related proteins that combines a powerful upfront tissue cell lysis with high resolution MS for discovery and protein array technology for verification may be an effective strategy for discovering candidate markers in highly fibrous tissue samples </plain></SENT>
