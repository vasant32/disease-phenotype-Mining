<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the relationships between Ca(2+) handling, reduced myocyte contractility, and enhanced arrhythmogenesis during HF progression in a canine model of non-ischaemic HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Key Ca(2+) handling parameters were determined by measuring cytosolic and intra-sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) [Ca(2+)] in isolated ventricular myocytes at different stages of HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The progression of HF was associated with an early and continuous increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor (RyR2)-mediated SR Ca(2+) leak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increase in RyR2 activity was paralleled by an increase in the frequency of diastolic spontaneous Ca(2+) waves (SCWs) in HF myocytes under conditions of Î²-adrenergic stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to causing arrhythmogenic-delayed afterdepolarizations, SCWs decreased the amplitude of subsequent electrically evoked Ca(2+) transients by depleting SR Ca(2+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At late stages of HF, Ca(2+) release oscillated essentially independent of electrical pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increased propensity for the generation of SCWs in HF myocytes was attributable to reduced ability of the RyR2 channels to become refractory following Ca(2+) release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The progressive alterations in RyR2 function and Ca(2+) cycling in HF myocytes were associated with sequential modifications of RyR2 by CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi> oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that destabilized RyR2 activity due to excessive CaMKII phopshorylation and oxidation resulting in impaired post-release refractoriness is a common mechanism involved in arrhythmogenesis and contractile dysfunction in the failing heart </plain></SENT>
