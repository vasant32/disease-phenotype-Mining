<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Ninety-six gravidas were referred to the cardiology clinic for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, or dizziness and had Holter monitoring or ERT after a baseline electroencephalogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmias</z:hpo> were classified by severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Gestational age at referral was 22.6 weeks Â± 8.3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five patients had ERTs performed, and 19 had Holter monitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six percent had benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In our ERT cohort, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> showed a fourfold increase in serious RD during gestation (odds ratio [OR] 4.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 20.3, p = 0.01); <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (body mass index &gt; 30) had a fourfold increased risk (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.0 to 1, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serious RD did not result in greater chance of cesarean delivery or induction of labor, or a newborn with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Most pregnant women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> have benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ERT appears to be a better method of diagnosis in pregnant women </plain></SENT>
