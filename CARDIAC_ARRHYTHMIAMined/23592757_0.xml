<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to evaluate the ventricular repolarization by QT dynamicity in patients with POF.METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled 26 female patients (mean age 37.5 ± 10.1 years) with primary POF and 31 healthy female subjects (mean age 37.5 ± 9.0 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The linear regression slopes of the QT interval measured to the apex and to the end of the T-wave plotted against RR intervals (QTapex/RR and QTend/RR slopes, respectively) were calculated from 24 h Holter recordings using a standard algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>QTapex/RR and QTend/RR slopes were more steeper in the POF patients in contrary to healthy control subjects (QTapex/RR = 0.184 ± 0.022 vs. 0.131 ± 0.019, P &lt; 0.001; QTend/RR = 0.164 ± 0.021 vs. 0.128 ± 0.018, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pearson's correlation analyses revealed a stronger negative correlation between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23965">oestradiol</z:chebi> (E2) and QTapex/RR (r = -0.715, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was also a moderate negative correlation between E2 and QTend/RR (r = -0.537, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum follicle-stimulating hormone level was positively correlated with QTapex/RR (r = 0.681, P &lt; 0.001) and QTend/RR (r = 0.531, P &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Our study results suggest that QT dynamicity is impaired in patients with POF despite the absence of overt cardiovascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to elucidate the prognostic significance and clinical implications of impaired ventricular repolarization in patients with POF </plain></SENT>
