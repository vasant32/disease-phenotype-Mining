<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Ablation is increasingly used to treat primary and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002896'>liver cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ablation near portal pedicles and hepatic veins is challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a new ablation technique that does not rely on heat and, in animals, appears to be safe and effective when applied near hepatic veins and portal pedicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the safety and short-term outcomes of IRE to ablate perivascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0345904" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="LCC">malignant liver tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of patients treated with IRE between January 1, 2011 and November 2, 2011 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were selected for IRE when resection or thermal ablation was not indicated due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment outcomes were classified by local, regional, and systemic recurrence and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Local failure was defined as abnormal enhancement at the periphery of an ablation defect on post-procedure contrast imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients had 65 tumors treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients (79%) were treated via an open approach and 6 (21%) were treated percutaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size was 1 cm (range 0.5 to 5 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were &lt;1 cm from a major hepatic vein; 16 were &lt;1 cm from a major portal pedicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Complications included 1 intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and 1 postoperative portal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Overall morbidity was 3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There were no treatment-associated mortalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>At median follow-up of 6 months, there was 1 tumor with persistent disease (1.9%) and 3 tumors recurred locally (5.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This early analysis of IRE treatment of perivascular malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_352'>hepatic tumors</z:mpath> demonstrates safety for treating liver <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Larger studies and longer follow-up are necessary to determine long-term efficacy </plain></SENT>
