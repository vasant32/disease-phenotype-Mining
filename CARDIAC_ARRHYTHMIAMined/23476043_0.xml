<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background- A majority of patients undergoing ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> have implanted devices precluding substrate imaging with delayed-enhancement MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Contrast-enhanced multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) can depict myocardial wall thickness with submillimetric resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the relationship between regional myocardial wall thinning (WT) imaged by MDCT and arrhythmogenic substrate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857175" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postinfarction</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results- We studied 13 consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857175" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postinfarction</z:e> patients undergoing MDCT before ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MDCT data were integrated with high-density 3-dimensional electroanatomic maps acquired during sinus rhythm (endocardium, 509±291 points/map; epicardium, 716±323 points/map) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Low-voltage areas (&lt;1.5 mV) and local abnormal ventricular activities (LAVA) during sinus rhythm were assessed with regard to the WT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was found between the areas of WT &lt;5 mm and endocardial low voltage (correlation-R=0.82; P=0.001), but no such correlation was found in the epicardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The WT &lt;5 mm area was smaller than the endocardial low-voltage area (54 cm(2) [Q1-Q3, 46-92] versus 71 cm(2) [Q1-Q3, 59-124]; P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among a total of 13 060 electrograms reviewed in the whole study population, 538 LAVA were detected and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LAVA were located within the WT &lt;5 mm (469/538 [87%]) or at its border (100% within 23 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Very late LAVA (&gt;100 ms after QRS complex) were almost exclusively detected within the thinnest area (93% in the WT&lt;3 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusions- Regional myocardial WT correlates to low-voltage regions and distribution of LAVA critical for the generation and maintenance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857175" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postinfarction</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The integration of MDCT WT with 3-dimensional electroanatomic maps can help focus mapping and ablation on the culprit regions, even when MRI is precluded by the presence of implanted devices </plain></SENT>
