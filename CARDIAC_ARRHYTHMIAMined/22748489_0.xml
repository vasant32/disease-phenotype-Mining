<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The association between ongoing myocardial damage and outcomes in patients who have received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, who had received an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> (n = 107, mean age 65 ± 11 years), were prospectively enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Myocardial membrane injury (heart-type fatty acid binding protein [H-FABP] &gt;4.3 ng/mL) and myofibrillar injury (troponin T &gt;0.01 ng/mL) were defined using receiver operating characteristic curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed for a median of 33.6 months, to an end point of appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shock or cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Myocardial membrane injury (45%) and myofibrillar injury (41%) were equally prevalent among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> who had received <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shocks or cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in 31% and 15% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that serum H-FABP levels &gt;4.3 ng/mL, but not troponin T levels, were a significant independent prognostic factor for cardiac events (hazard ratio 5.502, 95% confidence interval 1.705-17.75, P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis revealed that measuring H-FABP levels was valuable for anticipating event-free survival among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> who were receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High H-FABP levels also predicted subsequent outcomes in patients who had received <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> for primary or secondary prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Evaluating myocardial damage using H-FABP may be a promising tool for predicting outcomes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> who have received <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
