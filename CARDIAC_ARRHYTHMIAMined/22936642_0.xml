<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to replicate the previous finding in terms of stress-related temperament trait, i.e. behavioural inhibition system (BIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study subjects included 583 LQTS mutation carriers (256 symptomatic and 327 asymptomatic) from the Finnish LQTS registry and 79 healthy subjects randomly derived from the population-based sample of the Young Finns Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic and asymptomatic LQTS mutation carriers did not differ from each other on BIS (3.27 versus 3.24, p &gt; 0.05), whereas LQTS mutation carriers scored higher on BIS than the comparison group derived from the representative population-based sample (3.25 versus 2.99, p = 0.003, η² = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BIS was significantly higher in women than in men (3.32 versus 3.06, p &lt; 0.001, η² = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results confirm our previous finding of higher stress proneness of LQTS mutation carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their innate stress proneness may have relevance because it increases our understanding on the role of stress in the manifestation of symptoms </plain></SENT>
