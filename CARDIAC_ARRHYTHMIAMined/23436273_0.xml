<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and smoking have been independently associated with lower heart rate variability (HRV), suggesting dysregulation of cardiac autonomic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no studies have systematically explored the effects of smoking on HRV among depressed patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study examined differences in HRV based on smoking status among depressed individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Electrophysiological data were examined among 77 adult outpatients without a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, who met criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1269683" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="MDD">major depressive disorder</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013415" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">dysthymia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Frequency domain [low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), LF/HF ratio, respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA)] parameters of HRV, and heart rate and inter-beat interval (IBI) data were compared between depressed smokers (n = 34) and depressed nonsmokers (n = 44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After controlling for covariates, depressed smokers, compared to depressed nonsmokers, displayed significantly lower LF, HF, and RSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among depressed patients, smoking is associated with significantly lower HRV, indicating dysregulated autonomic modulation of the heart </plain></SENT>
