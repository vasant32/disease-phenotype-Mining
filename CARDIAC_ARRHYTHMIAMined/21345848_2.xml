<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To evaluate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (ARVC/D) in affected families with desmosome mutations on the basis of the recently revised Task Force Criteria (TFC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and three consecutive carriers of pathogenic desmosome mutations and 102 mutation-negative relatives belonging to 22 families with dominant and 14 families with recessive ARVC/D were evaluated according to the original and revised TFC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serial cardiac assessment with 12-lead, signal-averaged, and 24 h ambulatory ECG and two-dimensional echocardiography was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical events and outcome were prospectively analysed up to 24 years (median 4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the revised criteria, 16 carriers were newly diagnosed on the basis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> in 100%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in 79%, and functional/structural alterations in 31%, increasing diagnostic sensitivity from 57 to 71% (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Task Force Criteria specificity improved from 92 to 99% (P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In dominant mutation carriers, penetrance changed significantly (61 vs. 42%, P = 0.001); no changes were observed in recessive homozygous carriers (97 vs. 97%, P = 1.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Affected carriers according to the revised TFC (n = 73) had 12-lead <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> in 96%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in 91%, and functional/structural alterations fulfilling echocardiographic criteria in 76% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cumulative and event-free survival did not differ significantly between dominant and recessive affected carriers, being at 78.6 vs. 76 and 51.7 vs. 55.4%, respectively, by the age of 40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Revised TFC increased diagnostic sensitivity particularly in dominant ARVC/D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serial family evaluation may rely on electrocardiography which seems to have the best diagnostic utility particularly in early disease that is not detectable by two-dimensional echocardiography </plain></SENT>
