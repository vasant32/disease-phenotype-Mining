<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Alternans of cardiac action potential duration (APD) is a well-known arrhythmogenic mechanism which results from dynamical instabilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The propensity to alternans is classically investigated by examining APD restitution and by deriving APD restitution slopes as predictive markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, experiments have shown that such markers are not always accurate for the prediction of alternans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a mathematical ventricular cell model known to exhibit unstable dynamics of both membrane potential and Ca²⁺ cycling, we demonstrate that an accurate marker can be obtained by pacing at cycle lengths (CLs) varying randomly around a basic CL (BCL) and by evaluating the transfer function between the time series of CLs and APDs using an autoregressive-moving-average (ARMA) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first pole of this transfer function corresponds to the eigenvalue (λ(<z:chebi fb="144" ids="37708">alt</z:chebi>)) of the dominant eigenmode of the cardiac system, which predicts that alternans occurs when λ(<z:chebi fb="144" ids="37708">alt</z:chebi>) ≤ -1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For different BCLs, control values of λ(<z:chebi fb="144" ids="37708">alt</z:chebi>) were obtained using eigenmode analysis and compared to the first pole of the transfer function estimated using ARMA model fitting in simulations of random pacing protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> versions of the cell model, this pole provided an accurate estimation of λ(<z:chebi fb="144" ids="37708">alt</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, during slow ramp decreases of BCL or simulated drug application, this approach predicted the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of alternans by extrapolating the time course of the estimated λ(<z:chebi fb="144" ids="37708">alt</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, stochastic pacing and ARMA model identification represents a novel approach to predict alternans without making any assumptions about its ionic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It should therefore be applicable experimentally for any type of myocardial cell </plain></SENT>
