<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Left atrial volume and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> diameters were compared by computed tomography (CT) before and 3 months after pulmonary vein isolation using duty-cycled phased radio frequency energy (2:1 or 4:1 bipolar/unipolar ratio) in 50 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary vein diameter was measured in a coronal and axial view at 3 levels (A, ostium; B, 1 cm more distal; C, 2 cm more distal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moderate PVN was defined as a pulmonary vein diameter reduction of 25 to 50%, and severe PVN as &gt;50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Left atrial volume decreased by 12Â±12% (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Axial pulmonary vein diameter shortened by a median of 16% (interquartile range [IQR] 28 to 5%), 13% (IQR 25 to 5%), and 9% (IQR 21 to -3%) at level A, B, and C, respectively (P&lt;0.01 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>); coronal pulmonary vein diameter decreased by a median of 16% (IQR 24 to 7%), 11% (IQR 21 to 4%), and 8% (IQR 18 to -2%; P&lt;0.01 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moderate PVN occurred in 30% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e>, in 78% of the patients; severe PVN occurred in 4% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e>, in 15% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> diameter reduction was not related to changes in left atrial volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Isolation of the pulmonary veins using a multielectrode ablation catheter and duty cycled phased radiofrequency energy delivery results in a consistent moderate reduction of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> diameters predominantly at the ostium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Severe PVN in 15% of patients raises concerns about the risk for clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> stenosis </plain></SENT>
