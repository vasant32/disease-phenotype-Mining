<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION.: Atrial tachyarrhythmias, particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp>, are commonly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> and are a major cause of morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Cox-maze procedure, introduced by Dr. James Cox in 1987, is effective at controlling <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in structurally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Though the Cox-maze procedure has been used for atrial tachyarrhythmias in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo>, few studies have looked at its effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS.: A retrospective chart review was performed on 24 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> who underwent the Cox-maze procedure at the Medical College of Wisconsin from 2004 through 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS.: Mean age at time of Cox-maze procedure for the cohort was 40.9 years (range, 14 to 66 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart diseases</z:hpo> among the patients included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> (n = 8) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006695'>atrioventricular septal defect</z:hpo> (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had concomitant cardiac procedures with the most common being right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction (n = 10), tricuspid valve repair (n = 8), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> repair (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prior to the Cox-maze procedure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> consisted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> or intratrial reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (n = 19) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were three early postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and one late postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was available for 19 of 21 (90%) survivors with a mean length to follow-up from Cox-maze procedure of 2.8 years (range, 0.14-5.7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At last follow-up, 14 (74%) of the survivors remained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS.: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> and atrial tachyarrhythmias, the majority were rendered <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-free by the Cox-maze procedure </plain></SENT>
