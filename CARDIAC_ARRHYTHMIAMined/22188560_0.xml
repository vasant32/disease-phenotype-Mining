<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specifically, impedance cardiograms (ICGs) are especially beneficial because they have no effect on the tissue or organs and can monitor various parameters simultaneously, including the heart rate and heart contractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this article, we measured impedance changes in porcine left ventricles using electrodes placed around the inlet and outlet cannulae of the VAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The measured left ventricular impedance (LVI) waveform changes are caused by heart movements, such as cardiac muscle contraction and changes in blood volume as a result of heart filling and emptying </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast to other impedance measurements, LVI is less affected by the movement of other organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using a porcine model, LVIs were measured and compared with blood flow data measured with an ultrasound blood flowmeter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ICG showed the same frequency as the animal's heart rate, and their amplitudes were closely related to cardiac output (CO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the waveform differed from other vital signs, such as CO, electrocardiogram, and blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound images were used to explain the impedance waveform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the ultrasound images, we obtained the shape and size of the animal's heart and calculated the predicted impedance data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We then compared these to the actual measured data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results show that the impedance signal contains detailed information on heart rate and CO; these results were unaffected by the cannulae or VAD perfusion </plain></SENT>
