<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002091'>Restrictive lung disease</z:hpo> (RLD) may contribute to reduced exercise capacity in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of RLD and its impact on exercise tolerance in the adult with CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred consecutive adult patients with CHD, who underwent routine cardiopulmonary exercise testing with spirometry, were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical data were obtained by retrospective chart review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients from 10 major diagnostic groups were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median age for the cohort was 31 years (range 18-63) and included 43 males and 57 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most patients, 79%, had at least one previous surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on spirometry and flow/volume loops, 50 patients were classified as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pulmonary function, 44 patients had patterns suggestive of RLD, 4 suggestive of mixed (obstructive and restrictive), and 2 indeterminate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Risk factors associated with RLD include history of multiple thoracotomies (odds ratio = 9.01, P =.05) and history of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (odd ratio = 4.25, P =.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, 56% of the patients had abnormal exercise capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Spirometry suggestive of RLD was a significant risk factor for decreased exercise capacity (odds ratio = 3.65, P =.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with spirometry suggesting RLD also had lower exercise duration (P =.004) and a higher New York Heart Association Functional Class (P =.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>History of previous surgery and <z:mp ids='MP_0005333'>decreased heart rate</z:mp> reserve were also significant risk factors for decreased exercise capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Abnormal spirometry suggestive of RLD is common in the adult with CHD and is a significant risk factor for decreased exercise tolerance in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to evaluate the relationship between RLD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003546'>exercise intolerance</z:hpo> and its relationship to mortality in the adult with CHD </plain></SENT>
