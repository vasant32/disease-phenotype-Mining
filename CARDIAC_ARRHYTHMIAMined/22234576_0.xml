<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Droperidol had been used as an effective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50919">antiemetic</z:chebi> since the 1970s but was withdrawn from the market in 2001 because of a black box warning about QT prolongation and possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> after high doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the meantime the black box warning has seriously been questioned and parenteral droperidol has again been licensed in 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because droperidol acts on dopaminergic receptors different to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>(3) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>, it could possibly serve as a rescue drug after failed postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> (PONV) prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Persistent PONV after the recommended prophylaxis is a significant problem in pediatric anesthesia but a satisfactory strategy has not yet been defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore a retrospective audit was performed in order to evaluate whether low-dose droperidol (10 µg/kgBW) would be an effective rescue drug for failed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50919">antiemetic</z:chebi> prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The electronic anesthesia patient data base of the University Children's Hospital Zurich was searched from 2004-2009 for patients who received low-dose droperidol in the postanesthesia care unit as rescue therapy for persistent PONV after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50919">antiemetic</z:chebi> prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on the recorded electronic data the effectiveness of low-dose droperidol as PONV rescue therapy and possible side effects were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 338 patients who received droperidol were found from a total of 34,032 patients and the charts were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these patients 134 were excluded because they had received droperidol for indications other than PONV, 43 patients were excluded because they had not received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50919">antiemetic</z:chebi> prophylaxis before droperidol and in 17 patients the data were incomplete, leaving 144 patients with an average age of 12.3 years (interquartile range IQR 9.5-15.2 years) for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The upper range of ages resulted from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases who were still being treated in the Children's Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Low-dose droperidol was given because of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> to 59 patients (41%) and to 85 patients (59%) for persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Initial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50919">antiemetic</z:chebi> prophylaxis and/or therapy had consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> plus tropisetrone in 80 patients and tropisetrone or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> alone in 64 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 128 patients (89%) rescue therapy with a median dose of 10.9 µg/kgBW droperidol was effective but <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> persisted in 16 patients (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Sedation was the only side effect recorded and this was observed in 39 patients (27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose droperidol (10 µg/kgBW) was found to be effective as rescue medication in pediatric patients experiencing PONV despite various prophylactic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50919">antiemetic</z:chebi> regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No neurological or cardiopulmonary side effects were recorded after this low dosage </plain></SENT>
