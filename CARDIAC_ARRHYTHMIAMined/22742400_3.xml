<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The combination of the transvenous endocardial approach with the thoracoscopic epicardial approach in a single AF ablation procedure overcomes the limitations of both techniques and should result in better outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort of 26 consecutive patients with AF who underwent hybrid thoracoscopic surgical and transvenous catheter ablation were followed, with follow-up of up to 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-six patients (42% with persistent AF) underwent successful hybrid procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 470 Â± 154 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 23% of the patients, the epicardial lesions were not transmural, and endocardial touch-up was necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One-year success, defined according to the Heart Rhythm Society, European Heart Rhythm Association, and European <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac Arrhythmia</z:hpo> Society consensus statement for the catheter and surgical ablation of AF, was 93% for patients with paroxysmal AF and 90% for patients with persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients underwent catheter ablation for recurrent AF or left <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> after the hybrid procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A combined transvenous endocardial and thoracoscopic epicardial ablation procedure for AF is feasible and safe, with a single-procedure success rate of 83% at 1 year </plain></SENT>
