<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of ibutilide on the defibrillation threshold (DFT), restitution properties, dispersion of refractoriness and activation patterns during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ibutilide was administrated intravenously in six open-chest beagles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before and after the drug administration, 20-second episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> were electrically induced and recorded with a 10×10 unipolar electrode plaque sutured on the lateral epicardium of the left ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DFT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> activation patterns, including type of epicardial activation maps, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> cycle length (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>-CL), conduction velocity, wavelength (WL) and reentry incidence, were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Restitution properties and dispersion of refractoriness were estimated from activation recovery intervals (ARI) during pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to baseline, ibutilide markedly decreased the DFT by 31% ((491 ± 14) V vs. (337 ± 59) V, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The drug significantly reduced the maximal slope of the restitution curve (1.34 ± 0.08 vs. 0.76 ± 0.06, P &lt; 0.01) and its epicardial dispersion (0.36 ± 0.09 vs. 0.21 ± 0.06, coefficient of variation, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The dispersion of refractoriness was enhanced at the pacing cycle length of 300 ms to 160 ms by ibutilide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The drug significantly increased the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>-CL ((96 ± 19) ms vs. (112 ± 20) ms, P &lt; 0.01) and the WL ((41 ± 9) mm vs. (52 ± 14) mm, P = 0.02) during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>, and reduced the reentry incidence by 25% (0.08 ± 0.02 vs. 0.06 ± 0.02, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the epicardial activation maps, ibutilide significantly reduced the percentage of more complex activation maps during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous ibutilide significantly decreased the DFT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It might be due to reduction of activation pattern complexity during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
