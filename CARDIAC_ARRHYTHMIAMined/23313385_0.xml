<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied the results of electrophysiological study (EPS) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001716'>Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome</z:hpo> (WPW) and spontaneous adverse clinical presentation and determined whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> added incremental value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: EPS was performed in 63 patients with WPW and adverse clinical presentation at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EPS was repeated after infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> in 37 patients, including 25 without criteria for a malignant form at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Atrioventricular orthodromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> was induced 44%, antidromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> in 11%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) in 68% at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At baseline EPS, criteria for a malignant form (AF induction and shortest CL &lt;250ms) were noted in 60%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> was not inducible in 16% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients met the criteria for a malignant form after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EPS at baseline missed 16% of patients at risk of life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> who had no inducible tachyarrhythmia and 40% without classical criteria for malignant form </plain></SENT>
