<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of the condition is about 5%, and it has a high in-hospital mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The condition has been reported to occur regardless of the approach that is used to drain the fluid or the underlying cause of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiology of paradoxical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemodynamic instability</z:e> and the appropriate intervention are not very clear, and further studies are needed to identify appropriate preventive measures.We report a rare manifestation of paradoxical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemodynamic instability</z:e> in a 65-year-old woman who had a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0855005" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage IV lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She presented with a one-week history of pleuritic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001954'>shortness of breath</z:mp> on exertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography revealed a large circumferential <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> with right atrial and ventricular collapse during diastole, suggesting a compressive effect of the pericardial fluid; however, left ventricular systolic function was well preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient underwent the scheduled creation of a subxiphoid pericardial window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immediately after the pericardial fluid was evacuated, her heart began to beat more vigorously, but this was abruptly followed by an episode of <z:mp ids='MP_0004086'>asystole</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pacing and medical therapy were unsuccessful in preventing repeated episodes of <z:mp ids='MP_0004086'>asystole</z:mp>, and the patient died.To our knowledge, this is the 2nd report of unexpected <z:mp ids='MP_0004086'>asystole</z:mp> after the creation of a subxiphoid pericardial window, and it is the first report of a takotsubo-like contractile pattern associated with paradoxical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemodynamic instability</z:e> </plain></SENT>
