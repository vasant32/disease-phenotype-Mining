<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Computer models that capture key features of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> myofiber architecture of right and left atria and interatrial septum provide a means of investigating the mechanisms responsible for atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The data necessary to implement such models have not previously been available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to characterize surface geometry and myofiber architecture throughout the atrial chambers and to investigate the effects of this structure on atrial activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Atrial surface geometry and myofiber orientations were reconstructed in 3D at 50×50×50-μm(3) resolution from serial images acquired throughout the sheep atrial chambers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Myofiber orientations were determined by Eigen-analysis of the structure tensor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data have been incorporated into an anatomic model that provides the first quantitative representation of myofiber architecture throughout the atrial chambers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By simulating activation on this 3D structure, we have confirmed the roles of specialized myofiber tracts such as the crista terminalis, pectinate muscles, and the Bachman bundle on the spread of activation from the sinus node </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrate how the complex myocyte arrangement in the posterior left atrium contributes to activation time dispersion adjacent to the pulmonary veins and increased vulnerability to rhythm disturbance generated by ectopic stimuli originating in the pulmonary vein sleeves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a structurally detailed, image-based model of atrial <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> that provides deeper understanding of the role that myocyte architecture plays in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal atrial electric function </plain></SENT>
