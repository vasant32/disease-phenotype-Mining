<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: This prospective and multicenter trial of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) aimed to evaluate the mortality rate (including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> [SCD]) and the efficacy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> in Chinese patients with high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: This trial was conducted in 31 centers in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We enrolled 497 patients who fulfilled Class I indication for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> (2002 ACC/AHA/NASPE guideline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed-up at 3, 6, and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical characteristics and echocardiographic parameters were collected at baseline and follow-up; Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 497 enrolled patients with Class I indication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy, 112 (22.5%) agreed to and received <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining 385 patients who were not available for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy were designated as the non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 11 Â± 3 months, there were a total of 38 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, 2 in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> group with a mortality of 1.8% and 36 in the non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> group, with a mortality of 9.4% and 26 due to SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall survival rate was 93% at 3 months of follow-up, 91% at 6 months, and 89% at 12 months, with an incidence of SCD of 5%, 7%, and 8% at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with Class I indication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation, the total mortality and incidence of SCD were high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy can effectively reduce the mortality in such patients </plain></SENT>
