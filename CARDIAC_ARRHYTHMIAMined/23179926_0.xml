<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The aim of this paper is to propose a transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) image acquisition protocol which provides a systematic manner of acquiring a minimal number of overlapping 3D TOE datasets allowing the reconstruction of a wide 3D view of the left atrium (LA) with anatomical landmarks that are important for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In eight cardiac surgical patients, 3D TOE datasets were acquired with a six-step protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the protocol, step 1 aims to acquire the central view of the mitral valve (MV), aortic valve (AV) and left atrial appendage (LAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Step 2 was developed to acquire the left pulmonary veins (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e>) and step 3 to acquire the right <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Steps 4, 5 and 6 were developed to create a sufficient overlap between different datasets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3D TOE datasets were registered and fused manually in end diastole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The image acquisition protocol was feasible in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the fused 3D dataset, a wide 3D view of the LA is shown, and left and right <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> could be seen simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The LAA, MV, AV and fossa ovalis (FO) were visualised clearly in the 3D TOE datasets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> ostia, which are located at the edges of the 3D datasets, suffered more from the artefact of echo loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The volume overlaps between neighbouring TOE datasets were 50-75Â % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The major part of the LA <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> incorporating the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e>, LAA, MV, AV and FO as important anatomical landmarks can be reconstructed by registering and fusing 3D datasets acquired with the six-step TOE image acquisition protocol </plain></SENT>
