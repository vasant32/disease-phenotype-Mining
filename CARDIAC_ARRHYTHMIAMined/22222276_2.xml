<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, nonfluoroscopic catheter guidance may increase the risk for inadvertent cardiac injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A novel radiofrequency ablation catheter capable of real-time tissue-tip contact force measurements may compensate for nonfluoroscopic safety issues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of contact force-controlled zero-fluoroscopy catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 30 patients (including 12 pediatric patients), zero-fluoroscopy catheter ablation of right-sided (right atrium, n = 20; right ventricle, n = 2) and left atrial (n = 8) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> was attempted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were symptomatic suspected atrioventricular nodal reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, atrioventricular reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, focal right atrial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and lone <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A novel irrigated-tip catheter with an integrated contact force sensor was used for nonfluoroscopic 3-dimensional electroanatomical mapping and radiofrequency ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transseptal access was gained under transesophageal guidance for ablation of left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Procedural success without fluoroscopy was achieved in 29 of the 30 patients (97%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 1 patient, endocardial nonfluoroscopic ablation failed because of an epicardial accessory pathway within a coronary sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean total contact force and amplitude of force undulations were kept below 50 g during mapping and below 40 g during ablation to prevent contact force peaks (&gt;100 g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Apart from a transient second-degree type I <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo>, no complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean procedure time was 2.8 ± 0.9 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrences during a mean follow-up of 6.2 ± 4.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Contact force-controlled zero-fluoroscopy catheter ablation is generally feasible in right-sided and left atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
