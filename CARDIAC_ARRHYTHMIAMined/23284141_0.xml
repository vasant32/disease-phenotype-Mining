<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated the risk of AF in relation to body mass index (BMI) among young fertile women.METHODS AND RESULTS: By cross-linkage of nationwide registers of childbirth and hospitalization, we identified 271 203 women without prior AF who gave birth in Denmark between 2004 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Body mass index (kg/m(2)) was examined as a risk factor for AF using proportional hazard models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 30.6 years (4.7 SD) and median follow-up was 4.6 years (interquartile range 2.9-5.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up, 110 women were hospitalized with first-time AF; very few individuals had known risk factors for AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall incidence rate of AF was 9.3 [95% confidence interval (CI): 7.7-11.2] per 100 000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to BMI, the incidence rate of AF per 100 000 person-years was 7.4 (5.6-9.7) in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight (BMI: 18.5-24.9), 8.5 (5.5-13.1) in overweight (BMI: 25-29.9), 15.8 (9.3-26.7) in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (BMI: 30-35), and 27.3 (15.5-48.1) in very <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (BMI &gt;35) individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariable regression analyses adjusted for age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo>, and previous use of beta-blockers revealed a hazard ratio of 2.04 (95% CI: 1.13-3.69) in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and 3.50 (1.86-6.58) in the very <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight.CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> is a risk factor for AF among young and essentially healthy fertile women despite the low incidence of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results may have implications for prevention of AF </plain></SENT>
