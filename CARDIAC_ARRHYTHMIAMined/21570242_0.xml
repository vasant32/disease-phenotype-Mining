<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that primary angioplasty (percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]) and contemporary medical treatment will result in a lower incidence of VA and shorten the time frame of their occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, an electrocardiographic monitoring period of 24 hours should be sufficient to detect more than 95% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> malignant VA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We continuously monitored <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with ST-segment elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e>) for 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 510 patients who underwent PCI for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e>, 24 (4.7%) developed sustained VA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty percent of sustained VA occurred during the first 24 hours; and 92%, during the first 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute, Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> flow grade less than 3, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003259'>elevated creatinine</z:hpo> (≥1 mg/dL), elevated C-reactive protein (≥0.8 mg/dL), higher white blood cell count (≥12 × 10(3)/μL), use of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi>, and lower hematocrit (≤39%) were associated with an increased risk of VA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Symptom-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>-to-balloon time of 4 hours or more in patients with postprocedural Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> 3 flow, treatment with β-blockers, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors</z:chebi> or angiotensin receptor blockers, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> were associated with a reduced risk of VA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After multivariate adjustment, independent predictors of sustained VA included total white blood cell count of 12 × 10(3)/μL or more, hematocrit of 39% or less, and lack of β-blocker medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we could demonstrate that primary PCI results in a lower incidence of VA compared with data from the literature but did not shorten the time frame of VA occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, an electrocardiographic monitoring period for VA of 48 hours should be performed in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
