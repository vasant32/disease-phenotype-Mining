<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Little is known about how environmental status affects antiarrhythmic potential of MSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To investigate the effect of paracrine factors secreted from MSCs under different circumstances on arrhythmogenicity in rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, we injected paracrine media (PM) secreted under hypoxic, normoxic conditions (hypoxic PM and normoxic PM), and MSC into the border zone of infarcted myocardium in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that the injection of hypoxic PM, but not normoxic PM, markedly restored conduction velocities, suppressed focal activity, and prevented sudden arrhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Underlying this electrophysiological alteration was a decrease in <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, restoration of connexin 43, alleviation of Ca(2+) overload, and recovery of Ca(2+)-regulatory ion channels and proteins, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which is supported by proteomic data showing that several paracrine factors including basic fibroblast growth factor, insulinlike growth factor 1, hepatocyte growth factor, and EF-hand domain-containing 2 are potential mediators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When compared with PM, MSC injection did not reduce or prevent arrhythmogenicity, suggesting that the antiarrhythmic or proarrhythmic potential of MSC is mainly dependent on paracrine factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A hypoxic or normoxic environment surrounding MSC affects the type and properties of the growth factors or cytokines, and these secreted molecules determine the characteristics of the electro-anatomical substrate of the surrounding myocardium </plain></SENT>
