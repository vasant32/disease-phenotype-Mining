<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to provide the spectrum and prevalence of mutations in the 12 Brugada syndrome (BrS)-susceptibility genes discovered to date in a single large cohort of unrelated BrS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: BrS is a potentially lethal heritable <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> syndrome diagnosed electrocardiographically by coved-type ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads (V1 to V3; type 1 Brugada electrocardiographic [ECG] pattern) and the presence of a personal/family history of cardiac events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using polymerase chain reaction, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, and DNA sequencing, comprehensive mutational analysis of BrS1- through BrS12-susceptibility genes was performed in 129 unrelated patients with possible/probable BrS (46 with clinically diagnosed BrS [ECG pattern plus personal/family history of a cardiac event] and 83 with a type 1 BrS ECG pattern only) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 27 patients (21%) had a putative pathogenic mutation, absent in 1,400 Caucasian reference alleles, including 21 patients with an SCN5A mutation, 2 with a CACNB2B mutation, and 1 each with a KCNJ8 mutation, a KCND3 mutation, an SCN1Bb mutation, and an HCN4 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall mutation yield was 23% in the type 1 BrS ECG pattern-only patients versus 17% in the clinically diagnosed BrS patients and was significantly greater among young men&lt;20 years of age with clinically diagnosed BrS and among patients who had a <z:mp ids='MP_0003896'>prolonged PQ interval</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We identified putative pathogenic mutations in âˆ¼20% of our BrS cohort, with BrS genes 2 through 12 accounting for &lt;5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the yield was similar between patients with only a type 1 BrS ECG pattern and those with clinically established BrS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The yield approaches 40% for SCN5A-mediated BrS (BrS1) when the PQ interval exceeds 200 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Calcium channel-mediated BrS is extremely unlikely in the absence of a short QT interval </plain></SENT>
