<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This amidation reaction is operationally straightforward and provides primary, secondary, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39409">tertiary amides</z:chebi> in good to excellent yields for most cases utilizing inexpensive and readily available reagents under mild conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In situ formation of <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> salts from free <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amines</z:chebi> extends the substrate scope of the reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chiral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="32988">amides</z:chebi> are also synthesized from their corresponding chiral <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amines</z:chebi> without detectable racemization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The practicality of this <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">amide</z:chebi> formation reaction has been demonstrated in an efficient synthesis of the antiarrhythmic drug N-acetylprocainamide </plain></SENT>
