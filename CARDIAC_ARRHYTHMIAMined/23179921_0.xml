<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Riata implantable cardioverter-defibrillator lead was recalled by the Food and Drug Administration because of an increased rate of failure associated with cable externalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of its mechanical separation, the Riata lead may be challenging to extract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore examined the experience with Riata lead extractions at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients implanted with the Riata lead underwent detailed review of their electronic medical records and operative notes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Procedural complications were ascertained by reviewing the medical records up to 30 days after Riata extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From a total of 627 patients implanted with the Riata lead at our institution, 20 patients (age at time of extraction, 57 ± 11 years; 85 % men; lead dwell time, 48 ± 27 months) underwent lead extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Extraction was successful in 19 of 20 (95 %) patients and required the use of laser-powered sheaths in 18 (90 %) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Over a 30-day follow-up period, 1 of 20 (5 %) patients had a minor procedure-related complication consisting of a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> that did not require drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Extraction of the Riata lead seems to be successful and safe and frequently requires the use of powered sheaths </plain></SENT>
