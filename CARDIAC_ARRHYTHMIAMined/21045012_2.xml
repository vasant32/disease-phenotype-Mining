<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To evaluate paediatric relatives of first- and non-first-degree family victims with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>premature sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) or aborted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> (ACA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-six consecutive referred families after SCD (n = 29) or ACA (n = 7) of a family member were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Referral was either due to an inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> identified after autopsy, post-event, or family evaluation (n = 20 families) or due to sudden unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (SUD, n = 16 families) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 3 of 16 (19%) SUD families, an inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> was diagnosed by evaluation of the paediatric relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 5 of 25 (20%) referred paediatric relatives of SUD families, an inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> was identified, mainly sinus node dysfunction (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 13 of 33 (39%) referred paediatric relatives of families with known inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> were affected, mainly with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (n = 5) and primary electrical disease (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prevention of SCD was initiated in 16 of the affected children by implantation of an antibradycardia device (n = 3), an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>, n = 6), and/or antiarrhythmic medication (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Appropriate and successful <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> discharges occurred in four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A stepwise, comprehensive clinical investigation of SCD or ACA families identifies a substantial number of paediatric relatives at risk of SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This allows for targeted prevention by effective treatments and evaluation of further relatives </plain></SENT>
