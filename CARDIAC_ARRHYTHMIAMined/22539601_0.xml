<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To explore the national prevalence, mutation spectrum, cardiac phenotype, and outcome of the uncommon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022387" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome</z:e> (JLNS), associated with a high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A national inventory of clinical JLNS cases was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genotype and area of origin were ascertained in index families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Retrospective clinical data were collected from medical records and interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified 19 cases in 13 Swedish families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A JLNS prevalence &gt;1:200 000 was revealed (five living cases &lt;10 years of age) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mutation spectrum consisted of eight KCNQ1 mutations, whereof p.R518X in 12/24 alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Geographic clustering of four mutations (20/24 alleles) and similarities to Norway's mutation spectrum were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A high prevalence of heterozygotes was suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three paediatric cases on β-blockers since birth were as yet asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seven symptomatic cases had suffered an aborted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> and four had died suddenly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>QTc prolongation was significantly longer in symptomatic cases (mean 605 ± 62 vs. 518 ± 50 ms, P = 0.016). β-Blockers reduced, but did not abolish, cardiac events in any previously symptomatic case. β-Blocker type, dosage, and compliance probably affect outcome significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>, n = 6) was associated with certain complications; however, no case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Founder</z:e> effects could explain 83% of the Swedish JLNS mutation spectrum and probably contribute to the high JLNS prevalence found in preadolescent Swedish children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Due to the severe cardiac phenotype in JLNS, the importance of stringent β-blocker therapy and compliance, and consideration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation in the case of therapy failure is stressed </plain></SENT>
