<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Successful cell-based tissue regeneration involves a complex orchestration of cellular and molecular events that include stem cell engraftment and differentiation, secretion of anti-inflammatory and angiogenic mediators, and proliferation of endogenous cardiac stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent therapeutic approaches involve bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells and mesenchymal stem cells, adipose tissue-derived stem cells, cardiac-derived stem cells and cell combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials employing mesenchymal stem cells and cardiac- derived stem cells have demonstrated efficacy in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size reduction and regional wall contractility improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regarding delivery methods, the safety of catheter-based, transendocardial stem cell injection has been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These proof-of-concept studies have paved the way for ongoing pivotal trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Future studies will focus on determining the most efficacious cell type(s) and/or cell combinations and the mechanisms underlying their therapeutic effects </plain></SENT>
