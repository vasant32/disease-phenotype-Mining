<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017919" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">glycogenoses</z:e> in humans have a cardiac phenotype, and reports exist of horses with PSSM and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18154">polysaccharide</z:chebi> inclusions in cardiac muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To investigate the hypothesis that horses with PSSM1 display a cardiac phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our objectives were to compare plasma cardiac troponin I (cTnI) concentration and the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> in PSSM1 homozygotes, heterozygotes, and control horses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and twenty-five Belgian and Percheron horses under the same management were genotyped for the R309H GYS1 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From these, 8 age-, breed-, and sex-matched cohorts of each genotype were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma cTnI concentration and incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> (determined by 24-hour Holter ECG) were compared between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although some PSSM1-affected horses had mildly increased plasma cTnI concentrations, there was no significant difference in cTnI concentrations between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the incidence of ectopic beats, cardiac conduction intervals or mean heart rate between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: We found no evidence of clinically relevant cardiac myocyte injury or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in horses with PSSM1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additional study is required to determine whether myocardial function may be compromised in this disorder </plain></SENT>
