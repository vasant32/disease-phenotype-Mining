<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> in cardiac asymptomatic subjects with HH (New York Heart Association functional class I) and compared it to that in age- and gender-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 42 subjects with HH and the 19 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects were recruited through the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-sponsored "Heart Study of <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>Hemochromatosis</z:mp>." They completed 48-hour Holter electrocardiography ambulatory monitoring at the baseline evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subjects with HH were classified as newly diagnosed (group A) and chronically treated (group B) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects with HH had C282Y homozygosity, and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers lacked any HFE gene mutations known to cause HH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although statistically insignificant, the incidence of ventricular and supraventricular ectopy tended to be greater in the combined HH groups than in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Supraventricular ectopy was more frequently noted in group B compared to in the controls (ectopy rate per hour 11.1 ± 29.9 vs 1.5 ± 3.5, p &lt; 0.05, using the Kruskal-Wallis test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No examples of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>heart block</z:hpo>, other than first-degree atrioventricular node block, were seen in any of the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> was not significantly reduced after 6 months of intensive iron removal therapy in the group A subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were observed in our subjects with HH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data suggest that the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> is, at most, marginally increased in asymptomatic subjects with HH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A larger clinical study is warranted to further clarify our observation </plain></SENT>
