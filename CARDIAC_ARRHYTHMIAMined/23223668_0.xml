<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Implantation of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e>) in patients with a high risk for life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> is a standard therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The development of new <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> leads, shock algorithms, high-energy defibrillators and rapid energy supply has improved the devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the discussion regarding 'shock or no shock' to test the system intraoperatively has not silenced yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 718 patients (60.0 ± 14.2 years old, 570 male) who were treated with a first <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> at our institution since 2005 were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The indication for implantation was primarily prophylactic in 511 patients (71.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Underlying diseases included ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (358 patients, 50%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (270 patients, 37.7%) and others (12.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean ejection fraction was 27.4 ± 11.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> was induced with a T-wave shock or burst stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The primary end-point was failing the initial intraoperative testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the initial testing, 28 patients (3.9%) had a defibrillation threshold (DFT) &gt;21 J </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean age of these patients was 51 ± 14 years, ranging from 22 to 71 years, 20 were male, and the ejection fraction was 23.8 ± 11.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The indication for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation was prophylactic in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one of the 28 patients suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, whereas seven patients had ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> were implanted on the left side and four on the right side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had been treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> at the time of implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients achieved a sufficient DFT ≤ 21 J by changing the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> leads, device repositioning and/or optimizing the shock configuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The standard of care intraoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> testing remains necessary </plain></SENT>
