<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility and pathologic complete response rate of induction bevacizumab + modified infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (FOLFOX) 6 regimen followed by concurrent bevacizumab, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, continuous infusion <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU), and radiation for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eligible patients received 1 month of induction bevacizumab and mFOLFOX6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients then received 50.4 Gy of radiation and concurrent bevacizumab (5 mg/kg on Days 1, 15, and 29), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (50 mg/m(2)/week for 6 weeks), and continuous infusion 5-FU (200 mg/m(2)/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of gastrointestinal toxicity, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> dose was reduced to 40 mg/m(2)/week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Resection was performed 4-8 weeks after the completion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The trial was terminated early because of toxicity after 26 eligible patients were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 1 patient had significant toxicity (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>) during induction treatment and was removed from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e>, Grade 3/4 toxicity was experienced by 19 of 25 patients (76%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common Grade 3/4 toxicities were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, and pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five of 25 patients (20%) had a complete pathologic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nine of 25 patients (36%) developed postoperative complications including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (n = 4), delayed healing (n = 3), leak/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> (n = 2), <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> fluid collection (n = 2), ischemic colonic reservoir (n = 1), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, bevacizumab, continuous infusion 5-FU, and radiation causes significant gastrointestinal toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The pathologic complete response rate of this regimen was similar to other fluorouracil <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The high incidence of postoperative wound complications is concerning and consistent with other reports utilizing bevacizumab with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> before major surgical resections </plain></SENT>
