<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Profound hyperkalaemia, developing over several hours, can lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This case series reports three episodes of sustained-release <z:chebi fb="11" ids="32588">potassium chloride</z:chebi> poisoning in two individuals requiring whole bowel irrigation or haemodialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first two episodes, in the same patient, illustrate the contrast between the successful use of decontamination versus the need for haemodialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second case, in a child, illustrates the need for tertiary level paediatric expertise in managing this type of poisoning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whole bowel irrigation with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> is a resource-intensive procedure most beneficial when large numbers of radio-opaque tablets are seen in the stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In cases where most of the tablet matter has already been absorbed, extracorporeal methods of rapidly reducing the total body burden of <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>, such as haemodialysis, might be life-saving </plain></SENT>
