<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A retrospective review of 222 patients having a focused transthoracic echocardiogram and evaluating the incidence and echocardiographic risk factors associated with perioperative adverse cardiac events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A single tertiary referral university teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred twenty patients who had a focused transthoracic echocardiogram performed by an anesthesiologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who had a focused transthoracic echocardiogram had their discharge summary and any perioperative troponin levels reviewed, looking for evidence of adverse cardiac events, including cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> before discharge, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> requiring vasoactive drug infusion, or new <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data were collected on the 222 patients who had an anesthesiologist-performed focused transthoracic echocardiogram, with 39 (18%) having an adverse cardiac event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 24 (11%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo>, 6 (2.7%) new <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, 5 (2.3%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, and 4 (1.8%) episodes of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High-risk pathology detected on echocardiography included adverse cardiac events in 64% of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo>, 56% of the patients with left or right ventricular dysfunction, and 17% of the patients with stenotic valvular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In particular, patients with a combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo>, ventricular dysfunction, and/or stenotic valvular disease had a 77% risk of an adverse cardiac event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no patients with a completely <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> study, flow murmur, or isolated regurgitant valvular disease had adverse cardiac events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Anesthesiologist-performed focused transthoracic echocardiography predicts perioperative adverse cardiac events in noncardiac surgical patients </plain></SENT>
