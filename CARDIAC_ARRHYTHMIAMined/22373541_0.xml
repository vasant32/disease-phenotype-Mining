<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The physiological importance of respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA) and cardioventilatory coupling (CVC) has not yet been fully elucidated, but these phenomena might contribute to improve ventilation/perfusion matching, with beneficial effects on gas exchange </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, decreased RSA amplitude has been suggested as an indicator of impaired autonomic control and poor clinical outcome, also during positive-pressure mechanical ventilation (MV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is currently unknown how different modes of MV, including variable tidal volumes (V(T)), affect RSA and CVC during anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the effects of pressure controlled (PCV) versus pressure assisted (PSV) ventilation, and of random variable versus constant V(T), on RSA and CVC in eight anesthetized pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At comparable depth of anesthesia, global hemodynamics, and ventilation, RSA amplitude increased from 20 ms in PCV to 50 ms in PSV (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CVC was detected (using proportional Shannon entropy of the interval between each inspiration <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and the previous R-peak in ECG) in two animals in PCV and seven animals in PSV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Variable V(T) did not significantly influence these phenomena </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, heart period and systolic arterial pressure oscillations were in phase during PCV but in counter-phase during PSV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the same depth of anesthesia in pigs, PSV increases RSA amplitude and CVC compared to PCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the central respiratory drive, but not the baroreflex or the mechano-electric feedback in the heart, is the main mechanism behind the RSA increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hence, differences in RSA and CVC between mechanically ventilated patients might reflect the difference in ventilation mode rather than autonomic impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Also, since gas exchange did not increase from PCV to PSV, it is questionable whether RSA has any significance in improving ventilation/perfusion matching during MV </plain></SENT>
