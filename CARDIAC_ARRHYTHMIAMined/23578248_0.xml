<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning for ondansetron due to a potential for prolongation of the QT interval of the electrocardiogram (ECG), a phenomenon that is associated with an increased risk of the potentially fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsade de pointes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Areas covered: The authors undertook a review of the cardiac safety of ondansetron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their primary sources of information were PubMed (with downloading of full articles) and the Internet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expert opinion: The dose of ondansetron that the FDA has concerns about is 32 mg i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(or several doses that are equivalent to this), which is only used in preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that ondansetron may be safe in lower doses used to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> in radiation treatment or postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, as there is a report that a lower dose of ondansetron prolonged the QT interval in healthy volunteers, this needs to be clarified by the FDA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More research needs to be undertaken on the relationship between QT prolongation and torsades in order that the FDA can produce clear-cut evidence of proarrhythmic risk when introducing warnings for this </plain></SENT>
