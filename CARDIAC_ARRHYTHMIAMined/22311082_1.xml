<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to explore the targets of the anti-arrhythmic effect of TMCC and the electrophysiological effects of TMCC on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in rat ventricular myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">Sodium</z:chebi> current (I(Na)), L-type calcium current (I(ca, L)), and transient outward <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current (I(to)) were measured and analyzed using whole-cell patch-clamp recording technique in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rat cardiac myocytes and rat ventricular myocytes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In isolated ventricular myocytes, I(Na) and I(to) were blocked by TMCC (100, 200, 400 μM) in a concentration-dependent manner, and the effects of TMCC (400 μM) were equal to that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, I (ca, L) was moderately increased by TMCC (400 μM) while significantly decreased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">Ouabain</z:chebi> (5 μM) significantly decreased <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>, L-type calcium, and transient outward <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> currents </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that I(Na), I(ca, L), and I(to) may be the targets of the antiarrhythmic effect of TMCC, which can antagonize <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi>-induced changes of ionic currents in rat ventricular myocytes </plain></SENT>
