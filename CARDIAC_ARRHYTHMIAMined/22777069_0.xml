<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Improved knowledge about the pathophysiology underlying these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> is essential in the search for new anti-arrhythmic strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="11230">Lysophosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> (LPC), a hydrolysis product of (membrane) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> degradation, is one of the most potent pro-arrhythmic substances that accumulate in the human heart during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to set up and validate an in vitro experimental system for studies on the effects of LPC on electrophysiological parameters in beating cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Spontaneously beating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-1 cardiomyocytes were cultured on multielectrode array microchips for three days for the recording of electrical activities in the form of field potentials (FP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FPs were recorded at baseline and after addition of 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 µM of LPC to the cell medium (n=9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that LPC could induce rapid effects on electrical parameters in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall half-maximal effective concentration (EC(50)) of LPC was around 12 µM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The beating rate and peak-peak amplitude of FP thus decreased at concentrations ≥ 12 µM and were inversely proportional to increased LPC concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The duration of FP was significantly prolonged with LPC above 12 µM and was concentration-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LPC delayed signal propagation, an effect which was mimicked by blocking gap junctions with heptanol and attenuated by pre-treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoprenaline</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, asynchronous activity was induced by LPC at &gt;12 µM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LPC induced prompt and pronounced electrophysiological alterations that may underlie its observed pro-arrhythmic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our in vitro model with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-1 cells and microelectrode array system may be a useful tool for preclinical studies of electrophysiological effects of various pathophysiological concepts </plain></SENT>
