<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze using noninvasive cardiac examinations a series of young athletes discovered to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (VAs) during the preparticipation screening program for competitive sports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred forty-five athletes (mean age 17 ± 5 years) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study protocol included electrocardiography (ECG), exercise testing, 2-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography, 24-hour Holter monitoring, signal-averaged ECG, and in selected cases contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results of ECG were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in most athletes (85%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VAs were initially detected prevalently during exercise testing (85%) and in the remaining cases on ECG and Holter monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Premature ventricular complexes disappeared during exercise in 56% of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Premature ventricular complexes during Holter monitoring averaged 4,700 per day, predominantly monomorphic (88%), single, and/or in couplets (79%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most important echocardiographic findings were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> in 29 patients (20%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> in 4 (3%), and right ventricular regional kinetic abnormalities in 5 (3.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, right ventricular regional kinetic abnormalities were detected in 9 of 30 athletes and were diagnostic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in only 1 athlete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, 30% of athletes were judged to have potentially dangerous VAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In asymptomatic athletes with prevalently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ECG, most VAs can be identified by adding an exercise test during preparticipation screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, cardiac screening with noninvasive examinations remains a fundamental tool for the identification of a possible pathologic substrate and for the characterization of electrical instability </plain></SENT>
