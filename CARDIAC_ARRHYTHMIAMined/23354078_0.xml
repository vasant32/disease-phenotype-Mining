<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We recently demonstrated that high frequency alternating current (HFAC) electric fields can reversibly block propagation in the heart by inducing an oscillating, elevated transmembrane potential (Vm) that maintains myocytes in a refractory state for the field duration and can terminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To quantify and characterize conduction block (CB) induced by HFAC fields and to determine whether the degree of CB can be used to predict defibrillation success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Optical mapping was performed in adult guinea pig hearts (n = 14), and simulations were performed in an anatomically accurate rabbit ventricular model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HFAC fields (50-500 Hz) were applied to the ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A novel power spectrum metric of CB-the loss of spectral power in the 1-30 Hz range, termed loss of conduction power (LCP)-was assessed during the HFAC field and compared with defibrillation success and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> vulnerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LCP increased with field strength and decreased with frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Optical mapping experiments conducted on the epicardial surface showed that LCP and the size of CB regions were significantly correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> initiation and termination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In simulations, subsurface myocardial LCP and CB sizes were more closely correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> termination than surface values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multilinear regression analysis of simulation results revealed that while CB on both the surface and the subsurface myocardium was predictive, subsurface myocardial CB was the better predictor of defibrillation success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HFAC fields induce a field-dependent state of CB, and defibrillation success is related to the degree and location of the CB </plain></SENT>
