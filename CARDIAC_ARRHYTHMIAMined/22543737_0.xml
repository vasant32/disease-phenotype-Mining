<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Strenuous exercise induces significant increases in inflammatory and cardiac biomarkers and transient dysfunction of the left ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is still unclear whether the electrophysiological correlate of these alterations can also be observed in ECG recordings, which indicate increased vulnerability for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ECG parameters were measured and compared with inflammatory and electrolyte statuses in 198 healthy men (42 ± 9 yr) 1 wk before (baseline) and at 0, 24, and 72 h after participating in a marathon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HR-corrected QT interval (QTc) duration increased significantly immediately after the race (442.4 ± 23.0 ms) compared with baseline (415.3 ± 22.5 ms, P &lt; 0.001) and returned to baseline values within 72 h (415.8 ± 24.7 ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other indices of ventricular repolarization (Sagie-Framingham-corrected QTcF, T(peak)-Tend (T(pe)) duration, T(pe)/QT ratio) showed similar results.Compared with baseline, significant decreases in serum concentrations of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> were shown immediately after the race (median (interquartile range): [Mg(2+)] = 0.85 (0.79-0.92) vs 0.77 (0.70-0.82) mmol · L(-1), P &lt; 0.001; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">[K+]</z:chebi> = 4.27 (4.02-4.58) vs 4.14 (3.81-4.57) mmol · L(-1), P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interleukin 6 values were significantly augmented immediately after the race compared with baseline (interleukin 6 = 2.08 (1.96-2.20) vs 30.56 (19.83-43.63) ng · L, P &lt; 0.001) and returned to baseline values within 72 h.Significant associations were not observed between ECG alterations and inflammatory or electrolyte concentrations (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac repolarization was significantly altered immediately after a marathon, coincident with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002917'>hypomagnesemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002900'>hypokalemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory and electrolyte statuses returned to baseline values within 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The current data do not support that ECG alterations after marathon running represent an increased risk for arrhythmic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, further investigation is warranted to describe these relationships in more detail </plain></SENT>
