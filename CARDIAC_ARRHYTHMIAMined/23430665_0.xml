<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The association between omega-3 (n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) and the clinical outcome of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> is currently unclear, especially regarding its possible antiarrhythmic effects and the not quite understood mechanisms of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the last 15 years, several epidemiological studies have shown a lower incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> with a diet rich in omega-3 or fish consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antiarrhythmic properties related to omega-3 have been related to modulation of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-dependent ion channels or <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-calcium exchangers of myocytes through a reduction of their excitability especially in ischaemic or damaged myocardial tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the results of experimental studies have not always been consistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the role of omega-3 in preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> has been evaluated in several clinical trials that included patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (particularly in patients with post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>), the interpretation of such data must be treated with extreme caution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In particular, while a reduction in cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was demonstrated by a meta-analysis of several randomized clinical trials, a reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> has been described only in the GISSI-Prevenzione study, while in other studies the evidence that emerged is more controversial, with wide confidence intervals that support the possibility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the distribution of the factors involved in the efficacy of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Omega-3 is probably involved in the prevention of cardiovascular mortality through different mechanisms, and it is crucial to study its association with other drugs such as <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitors</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The study of antiarrhythmic drugs has been divided into prevention of supraventricular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In these conditions, the role of omega-3 seems to be more pronounced in atrial tachyarrhythmias such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, but does not have a role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, the antiarrhythmic effect of omega-3 is not clearly evident and further studies are needed to investigate its beneficial effect in cardiac mortality compared with arrhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
