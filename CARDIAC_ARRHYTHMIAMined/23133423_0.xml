<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>While the mouse presents an invaluable experimental model organism in biology, its usefulness in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> research is limited in some aspects due to major electrophysiological differences between murine and human action potentials (APs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As previously described, these species-specific traits can be partly overcome by application of a cell-type transforming clamp (CTC) to anthropomorphize the murine cardiac AP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CTC is a hybrid experimental-computational dynamic clamp technique, in which a computationally calculated time-dependent current is inserted into a cell in real-time, to compensate for the differences between sarcolemmal currents of that cell (e.g., murine) and the desired species (e.g., human) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For effective CTC performance, mismatch between the measured cell and a mathematical model used to mimic the measured AP must be minimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have developed a genetic algorithm (GA) approach that rapidly tunes a mathematical model to reproduce the AP of the murine cardiac myocyte under study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to a prior implementation that used a template-based model selection approach, we show that GA optimization to a cell-specific model results in a much better recapitulation of the desired AP <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> with CTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This improvement was more pronounced when anthropomorphizing neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes to human-like APs than to guinea pig APs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CTC may be useful for a wide range of applications, from screening effects of pharmaceutical compounds on ion channel activity, to exploring variations in the mouse or human genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rapid GA optimization of a cell-specific mathematical model improves CTC performance and may therefore expand the applicability and usage of the CTC technique </plain></SENT>
