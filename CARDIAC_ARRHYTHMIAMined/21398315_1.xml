<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A genome-wide association study has recently associated an intronic single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in KCNN3 with lone AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We sequenced the coding region and splice junctions of KCNN3 in 209 early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> lone AF patients, screening for variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A group of 208 healthy blood donors with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ECGs and without cardiac symptoms were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients and controls were of Danish ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No mutations were found in the coding regions or splice sites of KCNN3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found one known exonic synonymous SNP (rs1131820) in KCNN3 that was associated with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both the genotype distribution and allele frequencies of SNP rs1131820 were significantly different between the AF cases and controls (PGenotype=0.047 and PAllele=0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Being a homozygous carrier of the major allele (GG) vs. the minor allele (AA) of rs1131820 was associated with an odds ratio of 2.85 (95% CI 1.13-7.18, P=0.026) for lone AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study of 209 young lone AF patients, we found no mutations in the exons or splice sites of KCNN3, but we found an association between the synonymous SNP rs1131820 in KCNN3 and lone AF </plain></SENT>
