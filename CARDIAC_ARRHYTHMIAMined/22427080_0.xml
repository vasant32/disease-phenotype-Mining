<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: During neurocardiogenic reaction provoked by tilt testing (TT), different <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001688'>sinus bradycardia</z:hpo>, sinus arrest, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> or junctional rhythm or beats (JR) may occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of the JR during neurocardiogenic reaction have not yet been systematically assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is not known whether the presence of JR during neurocardiogenic reaction is related to clinical characteristics of syncopal patients or the outcome of TT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aim: To assess whether clinical outcome of TT and clinical data are related to the presence of JR during TT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study group consisted of 532 patients aged 43.3 ± 18.2 years with positive TT, divided into four groups on the basis of the presence of JR and/or a ventricular pause (VP) during neurocardiogenic reaction: group VP(-)/JR(+) - JR present and VP absent, group VP(+)/JR(+) - both JR and VP present, group VP(+)/JR(-) - JR absent and VP present, and group VP(-)/JR(-) - both JR and VP absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The control group consisted of 53 patients with no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> or presyncope, including 46 patients with negative TT and seven patients with false positive TT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> during TT occurred in group VP(-)/JR(+) less frequently than in groups VP(+)/JR(+) and VP(+)/JR(-), and more frequently than in group VP(-)/JR(-) (80% vs 96% vs 94% vs 62%; p 〈 0.05 for both comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group VP(-)/JR(+) was significantly younger than group VP(-)/JR(-) (37.3 ± 16.3 years vs 45.8 ± 18.9 years; p 〈 0.05) and had a lower number of syncopal events than group VP(+)/JR(+) and VP(+)/JR(-) (median [IQ]: 2.5 (1-6) vs 4 (2-12) and 4 (2-10), respectively; p 〈 0.05) and lower rate of traumatic injuries than group VP(+)/JR(+) and VP(+)/JR(-) (22% vs 45% and 39%, respectively; p 〈 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis revealed that the presence of JR was associated with younger age, male gender, history of blood-instrumentation-injection <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0349231" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">phobia</z:e> and higher number of syncopal spells in medical history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ROC curve analysis revealed that a junctional rate of no more than 49 bpm was related to the total <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> during TT (p 〈 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>JR frequently occurs during positive TT and in no subjects with negative TT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Among patients with JR, two groups may be chosen on the basis of a VP occurrence, and these groups differ in respect to clinical characteristics and TT outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Relatively rapid JR without VP is related to consciousness preservation during neurocardiogenic reaction at TT and fewer syncopal spells as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> associated with injury in the past </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In patients with JR and VP, the JR is slower, of shorter duration, and more frequently single or pairs of junctional beats occur, which indicates high parasympathetic activity, whereas relatively rapid and stable JR may be the symptom of simultaneously increased sympathetic and parasympathetic activity </plain></SENT>
