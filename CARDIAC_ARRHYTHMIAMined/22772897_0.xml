<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although increased epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) volume is known to be associated with increased prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), the exact mechanisms are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated whether EAT locations were associated with high dominant frequency (DF) sites or complicated fractionated atrial electrogram sites during AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Three-dimensional reconstruction computed tomography images depicting EAT volumes (obtained by 320-detector-row multislice computed tomography) were merged with NavX-based DF and complicated fractionated atrial electrogram maps obtained during AF for 16 patients with paroxysmal AF and for 18 patients with persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Agreement between locations of the EAT, especially EAT surrounding the left atrium, and of high DF or complicated fractionated atrial electrogram sites was quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, serum biomarker levels were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EAT surrounding the left atrium volumes was significantly greater in patients with persistent AF than in patients with paroxysmal AF (52.9 cm(3) [95% CI, 44.2-61.5] versus 34.8 cm(3) [95% CI, 26.6-43.0]; P=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 levels were significantly higher in persistent AF patients than in paroxysmal AF patients (median high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, 969 ng/mL [interquartile range, 307-1678] versus 320 ng/mL [interquartile range, 120-660]; P=0.008; median interleukin-6, 2.4 pg/mL [interquartile range, 1.7-3.2] versus 1.3 [interquartile range, 0.8-2.4] pg/mL; P=0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EAT locations were in excellent agreement with high DF sites (κ=0.77 [95% CI, 0.71-0.82]) but in poor agreement with complicated fractionated atrial electrogram sites (κ=0.22 [95% CI, 0.13-0.31]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased EAT volume and elevation of inflammatory biomarkers are noted in persistent AF rather than paroxysmal AF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High DF sites are located adjacent to EAT sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, EAT may be involved in the maintenance of AF </plain></SENT>
