<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The optimal dialysate calcium concentration to maintain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mineralization and reduce risk of cardiovascular events in hemodialysis patients is debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Guidelines suggest that dialysate Ca concentration should be lowered to avoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0004934'>vascular calcification</z:hpo>, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> may be more likely to occur at lower dialysate Ca </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Concurrent use of QT-prolonging medications may also exacerbate arrhythmic risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study examined the influence of serum Ca, dialysate Ca, and QT interval-prolonging medications on the risk of sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> in a cohort of hemodialysis patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, &amp; MEASUREMENTS: This case-control study among 43,200 hemodialysis patients occurred between 2002 and 2005; 510 patients who experienced a witnessed sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> were compared with 1560 matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study examined covariate-adjusted sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> risk associations with serum Ca, dialysate Ca, serum dialysate Ca gradient, and prescription of QT-prolonging medications using logistic regression techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients assigned to low Ca dialysate&lt;2.5 mEq/L were more likely to be exposed to larger serum dialysate Ca gradient and had a greater fall in BP during dialysis treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After accounting for covariates and baseline differences, low Ca dialysate&lt;2.5 mEq/L (odds ratio=2.00, 95% confidence interval=1.40-2.90), higher corrected serum Ca (odds ratio=1.10, 95% confidence interval=1.00-1.30), and increasing serum dialysate Ca gradient (odds ratio=1.40, 95% confidence interval=1.10-1.80) were associated with increased risk of sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, whereas there were no significant risk associations with QT-prolonging medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased risk of sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> associated with low Ca dialysate and large serum dialysate Ca gradients should be considered in determining the optimal dialysate Ca prescription </plain></SENT>
