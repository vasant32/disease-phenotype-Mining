<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, whether transplantation improved the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> threshold and whether severe malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> is induced in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> model are still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to investigate the electrophysiologic characteristics and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> threshold in rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> by treatment with allogeneic cardiac stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University-affiliated hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial infarction</z:hpo> was induced in 20 male Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two weeks later, animals were randomized to receive 5 × 10(6) cardiac stem cells labeled with PKH26 in phosphate buffer solution or a phosphate buffer solution-alone injection into the infarcted anterior ventricular-free wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Six weeks after the cardiac stem cell or phosphate buffer solution injection, electrophysiologic characteristics and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> threshold were measured at the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> marginal zone, and noninfarct zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Labeled cardiac stem cells were observed in 5-μm cryostat sections from each harvested heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The unipolar electrogram activation recovery time dispersions were shorter in the cardiac stem cell group compared with those at the phosphate buffer solution group (15.5 ± 4.4 vs. 38.6 ± 14.9 msecs, p = .000177) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> were significantly (p = .00108) less inducible in the cardiac stem cell group (one of ten) than the phosphate buffer solution group (nine of ten) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> thresholds were greatly improved in the cardiac stem cell group compared with the phosphate buffer solution group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Labeled cardiac stem cells were identified in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> marginal zone and expressed Connexin-43, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor, α-smooth muscle actin, and α-sarcomeric actin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac stem cells may modulate the electrophysiologic abnormality and improve the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> threshold in rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> treated with allogeneic cardiac stem cells and cardiac stem cell express markers that suggest muscle, endothelium, and vascular smooth <z:mp ids='MP_0005369'>muscle phenotypes</z:mp> in vivo </plain></SENT>
