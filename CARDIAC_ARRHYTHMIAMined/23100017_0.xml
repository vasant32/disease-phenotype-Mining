<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>Ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> are the most feared cardiac manifestation; they are often unpredictable, may be the first manifestation of the disease and may be fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The propensity for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (SVA) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0392077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac sarcoidosis</z:e> has not been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence as well as predictors of SVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 100 patients with biopsy-proven systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e> and evidence of cardiac involvement (defined by cardiac biopsy, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography or cardiac MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 5.8Â±3.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ECG, Holter, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> interrogations and/or electrophysiology studies were used to document SVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic data, demographics, extracardiac involvement were recorded and univariate and Poisson regression were performed to compare characteristics of patients with and without documented SVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of SVA was 32% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> comprising 18% of the total burden, followed by atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> 7%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> 5%, and 2% other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVTs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with SVA, 96% were symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Left atrial enlargement (LAE) was more frequent in the group of patients with SVA with an incidence of 267.8 per 1,000 person-years and it significantly increased the likelihood of SVA on multivariate analysis (RR: 6.12; 95% confidence interval: 2.19-17.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Diastolic dysfunction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo>, right atrial enlargement (RAE) were also predictors of SVA on univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, RV dysfunction, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tricuspid valve disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036205" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary sarcoidosis</z:e> were not associated with SVA on univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study systematically evaluates the frequency of SVA in a large number of patients with CS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>SVA in patients with CS is frequent and associated with symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>LAE was clearly associated with the development of SVA in our patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The extent to which LAE predicts the occurrence of SVA in larger more diverse CS populations should be evaluated prospectively </plain></SENT>
