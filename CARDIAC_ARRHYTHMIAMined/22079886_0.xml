<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between mild-to-moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> and first ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Renal function in patients included in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> Genetics in the NEtherlands Study (AGNES) were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases (n = 337, age 56 ± 1 year, 80% men) were defined as patients who had survived <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> at the time of their first <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ST elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e>), and controls (n = 339, age 58 ± 1 years, 80% men) were defined as those without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> during their first <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> was computed using the 4-variable Modification of Diet in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Renal Disease</z:e> equation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At eGFR less than 105 mL/min, a decrease in eGFR was associated with elevated odds of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association was essentially flat at eGFR levels &gt;105 mL/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lowest eGFR quintile was associated with a &gt;6-fold increase in odds of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> compared to the fourth quintile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This association between eGFR and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> at the time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> remained significant after adjusting for potential confounders including electrolyte levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Mild-to-moderate kidney dysfunction is associated with a significantly elevated risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to investigate the precise mechanisms by which mild kidney function results in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
