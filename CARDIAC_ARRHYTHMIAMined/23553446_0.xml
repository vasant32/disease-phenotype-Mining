<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: As part of the FP7 ARITMO (Arrhythmogenic Potential of Drugs) project, we explored the publicly available US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database to detect signals of torsadogenicity for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi> (APs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four groups of events in decreasing order of drug-attributable risk were identified: (1) TdP, (2) QT-interval abnormalities, (3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, and (4) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reporting odds ratio (ROR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI) was calculated through a cumulative analysis from group 1 to 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For groups 1+2, ROR was adjusted for age, gender, and concomitant drugs (e.g., antiarrhythmics) and stratified for AZCERT drugs, lists I and II ( http://www.azcert.org , as of June 2011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A potential signal of torsadogenicity was defined if a drug met <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the following criteria: (a) four or more cases in group 1+2; (b) significant ROR in group 1+2 that persists through the cumulative approach; (c) significant adjusted ROR for group 1+2 in the stratum without AZCERT drugs; (d) not included in AZCERT lists (as of June 2011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over the 7-year period, 37 APs were reported in 4,794 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>: 140 (group 1), 883 (group 2), 1,651 (group 3), and 2,120 (group 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on our criteria, the following potential signals of torsadogenicity were found: amisulpride (25 cases; adjusted ROR in the stratum without AZCERT drugs = 43.94, 95 % CI 22.82-84.60), cyamemazine (11; 15.48, 6.87-34.91), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7735">olanzapine</z:chebi> (189; 7.74, 6.45-9.30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This pharmacovigilance analysis on the FAERS found 3 potential signals of torsadogenicity for drugs previously unknown for this risk </plain></SENT>
