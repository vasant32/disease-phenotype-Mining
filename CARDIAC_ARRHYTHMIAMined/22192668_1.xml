<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: In this study, we evaluated the impact of 2 common β1-adrenergic receptor (β1-AR) polymorphisms (G389R and S49G) in response to ventricular rate control therapy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Randomized studies have shown that ventricular rate control is an acceptable treatment strategy in patients with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, identification of patients who will adequately respond to rate-control therapy remains a challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 543 subjects (63% men; age 61.8 ± 14 years) prospectively enrolled in the Vanderbilt AF registry and managed with rate-control strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A "responder" displayed adequate ventricular rate control based on the AFFIRM (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial Fibrillation</z:hpo> Follow-Up Investigation of Rhythm Management) criteria: average heart rate (HR) at rest ≤80 beats/min; and maximum HR during a 6-min walk test ≤110 beats/min or average HR during 24-h Holter ≤100 beats/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 295 (54.3%) patients met the AFFIRM criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline clinical characteristics were similar in responders and nonresponders except for mean resting HR (76 ± 20 beats/min vs. 70 ± 15 beats/min; p &lt; 0.01) and smoking (6% vs. 1%; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple clinical variables (age, gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>) failed to predict response to rate-control therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By contrast, carriers of Gly variant at 389 were more likely to respond favorably to rate-control therapy; 60% versus 51% in the Arg389Arg genotype, p = 0.04 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This association persisted after correction for multiple clinical factors (odds ratio: 1.42, 95% confidence interval: 1.00 to 2.03, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among responders, subjects carrying the Gly389 variant required the lowest doses of rate-control medications; atenolol: 92 mg versus 68 mg; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi>: 44 mg versus 20 mg; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi>: 80 mg versus 72 mg; diltiazem: 212 mg versus 180 mg, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>: 276 mg versus 200 mg, respectively (p &lt; 0.01 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a common β1-AR polymorphism, G389R, that is associated with adequate response to rate-control therapy in AF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Gly389 is a loss-of-function variant; consequently, for the same adrenergic stimulation, it produces reduced levels of adenyl cyclase, and hence, attenuates the β-adrenergic cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mechanistically, the effect of rate-control drugs will be synergistic with that of the Gly389 variant, which could possibly explain our findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings represent a step forward in the development of a long-term strategy of selecting treatment options in AF based on genotype </plain></SENT>
