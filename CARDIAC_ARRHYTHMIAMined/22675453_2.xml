<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in these channels have recently been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conduction disorders</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>).We investigated a young male patient with a mixed phenotype composed of documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conduction disorder</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> associated with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further family screening revealed <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> in the patient's mother and sister and in three of the mother's sisters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of the complex clinical phenotypes, we screened SCN5A and identified a novel mutation, R219H, which is located on a highly conserved region on the fourth helix of the voltage sensor domain of Na(v)1.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three family members with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> carried the R219H mutation.The <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) and mutant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channels were expressed in a heterologous expression system, and intracellular pH (pHi) was measured using a pH-sensitive electrode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The biophysical characterization of the mutant channel revealed an unexpected selective proton leak with no effect on its biophysical properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15378">H(+)</z:chebi> leak through the mutated Na(v)1.5 channel was not related to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> permeation pathway but occurred through an alternative pore, most probably a proton wire on the voltage sensor domain.We propose that acidification of cardiac myocytes and/or downstream events may cause the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> phenotype and other electrical problems in affected family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The identification of this clinically significant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15378">H(+)</z:chebi> leak may lead to the development of more targeted treatments </plain></SENT>
