<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Electromechanical coupling, a well-described phenomenon in systolic dysfunction, has not been well studied in diastole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the ECG T-peak to T-end (TpTe) interval, representing transmural dispersion of repolarization, is associated with echocardiographic markers of diastolic dysfunction (DD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a prospective, cross-sectional study of the association between TpTe and markers of DD in 84 consecutive, unselected patients referred for exercise echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We systematically measured TpTe on the resting ECG, and we performed comprehensive assessment of DD at rest and at peak stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ECGs and echocardiograms were analyzed independently, blinded to each other and to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By univariable analysis, increased TpTe was associated with older age, increased E/e' ratio, and DD (P&lt;0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associations after correcting for multiple comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased TpTe was inversely associated with reduced tissue Doppler e' velocity, a marker of DD (R=-0.66, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This association persisted after adjusting for age, QTc, exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities, and left ventricular mass index (Î²=-0.41 [95% confidence interval, -0.70 to -0.12] cm/s per 10-ms increase in TpTe; P=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Baseline TpTe was also independently associated with resting DD (adjusted odds ratio, 3.9 [95% confidence interval, 1.4-10.7]; P=0.009) and peak exercise E/e' ratio (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased TpTe is associated with both resting and exercise-induced DD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Electromechanical coupling may represent a pathophysiologic link between electrical transmural dispersion of repolarization and abnormal myocardial relaxation, and may be a novel therapeutic target </plain></SENT>
