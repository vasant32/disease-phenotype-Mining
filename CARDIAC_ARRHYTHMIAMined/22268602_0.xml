<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors assessed skin conductance and respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> at rest and during laboratory stressors in 110 14-year-olds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, adolescents and their mothers provided both questionnaire and daily diary data (over 10 days) on emotional and interpersonal functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors found stronger associations between environmental risk factors (having a single-mother household or a mother with high internalizing problems) and psychosocial outcomes (externalizing problems, daily negative affect, and daily interaction quality) among youths with specific patterns of tonic and stress-induced sympathetic and parasympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system activity, but the pattern of moderating effects differed between boys and girls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings support the notion that individual differences in autonomic functioning index variation in youth's susceptibility to environmental risk factors </plain></SENT>
