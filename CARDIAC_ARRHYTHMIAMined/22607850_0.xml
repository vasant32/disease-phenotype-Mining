<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The magnitude of benefit of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) varies significantly among its recipients; approximately 30% of CRT patients do not report clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Optimization of CRT pacing parameters can further improve cardiac function, both acutely and chronically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic optimization is used in clinical practice, but it is time and resource consuming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, optimal settings at rest may change later with activity or cardiac remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The adaptive CRT (aCRT) algorithm was designed to provide automatic ambulatory adjustment of CRT pacing configuration (left ventricular or biventricular pacing) and device delays based on periodic measurement of electrical conduction intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The aCRT algorithm is currently undergoing evaluation in a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, worldwide clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The trial enrolled 522 patients, who satisfied standard clinical indications for a CRT device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within 2 weeks after the implant, the patients were randomized to aCRT versus echo-optimized biventricular pacing (Echo) settings in 2:1 ratio and followed up at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month postrandomization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The noninferiority primary trial objectives at 6-month postrandomization are to demonstrate that (a) the percentage of aCRT patients who improved in their clinical composite score is at least as high as the percentage of Echo patients; (b) cardiac performance as assessed by echocardiography is similar when using aCRT settings versus echo-optimized settings; and (c) aCRT does not result in inappropriate device settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>First and last patient enrollments occurred in November 2009 and December 2010, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The safety and efficacy of the aCRT algorithm will be evaluated in this ongoing clinical trial </plain></SENT>
