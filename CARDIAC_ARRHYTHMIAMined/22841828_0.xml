<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Since the first linkage of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long-QT syndrome</z:hpo> to the Harvey ras-1 gene in 1991 ample research has been performed to decipher the molecular-biophysical basis of congenital repolarization defects and the electrophysiological mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsades-de-pointes</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mechanistic knowledge is mostly derived from cellular experiments (cardiac myocytes, cultured cells), ventricular tissue (including arterially-perfused wedge) preparations and Langendorff-perfused hearts, with relatively little information from in-vivo animal models, and even more scant intact human-heart investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Until now, much emphasis has been put on purely membrane-related pathways of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> initiation with a prominent role for spatiotemporal dispersion of repolarization, early afterdepolarizations and reentrant excitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we review additional factors that influence the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsades de pointes</z:hpo>, notably myocardial Ca²⁺ (over) loading and spontaneous SR Ca²⁺ release, occurring particularly during intense sympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> stimulation and dynamic cycle-length changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recent tissue and in-vivo data suggest that spontaneous SR Ca²⁺ release, underlying aftercontractions in the isolated myocyte, may organize to local myocardial Ca²⁺ waves and aftercontractions in the intact heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the setting of prolonged repolarization and a negative electromechanical window, these spontaneous [Ca²⁺](<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi>)-based events (which often arise during early diastole) may exaggerate repolarization instability via [Ca²⁺](<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi>)-activated inward membrane currents and, as we postulate, via mechano-sensitive ion currents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Future long-QT research should focus on the intact beating heart with preserved autonomic input to examine these arrhythmogenic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
