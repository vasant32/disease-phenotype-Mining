<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> rejection algorithm for prospectively electrocardiogram (ECG)-triggered axial scans using dual-source CT (DSCT) examinations has recently been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We compared image quality and effective dose at DSCT examinations using prospectively ECG-triggered axial scanning with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> rejection software (PT-AAR) versus retrospectively ECG-gated helical scanning with tube-current modulation (RG-TCM) during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective case-control study of 90 patients (43 PT-AAR, 47 RG-TCM) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (defined as heart rate variability [HRV] &gt; 10 beats/min during data acquisition) referred for physician-supervised coronary CTA between April 2010 and September 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A subset of 22 cases matched for body mass index, HR, HRV, and other scan parameters was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjective image quality (4-point scale) and effective dose (dose length product method) were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PT-AAR was associated with lower effective dose than RG-TCM (4.1 vs 12.6 mSv entire cohort and 4.3 vs 9.1 mSv matched controls; both P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Image quality scores were excellent in both groups (3.9 PT-AAR vs 3.6 RG-TCM) and nondiagnostic segment rates were low (0.1% vs 0.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher image quality scores were found with PT-AAR in the entire cohort (P &lt; 0.05), and in matched controls with high HRV &gt; 28 beats/min (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with variable heart rates, prospectively ECG-triggered axial DSCT with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> rejection algorithm is feasible and can decrease radiation exposure by âˆ¼50% versus retrospectively ECG-gated helical DSCT, with preserved image quality </plain></SENT>
