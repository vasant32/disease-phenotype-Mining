<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In HCM, analyze the association between the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> determined by Holter electrocardiogram (ECG-Holter) and the degree of LVH determined by maximum wall thickness (MWT) in echocardiography and body mass index (BMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-four consecutive patients with HCM underwent 24-hour ECG-Holter and echocardiography for assessment of level of LVH through MWT and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two levels were established for the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>Ventricular Arrhythmias</z:hpo>: I - alone or paired <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>extrasystoles</z:mp> and II - Non- Sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>Ventricular Tachycardia</z:hpo> (NSVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 13 patients (24%) with NSVT (level II), there was a higher frequency of MWT of the left ventricle (LV) &gt; 21 mm (n = 10, 77%, 25 ± 4 mm) and LLLV = 144 g/m² (n = 10, 77%, 200 ± 30 g/m²), in comparison with those presenting with <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>extrasystole</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (level I) (n = 41, 76%), in which these measures were identified in, respectively, 37 % (n= 15, 23 ± 1 mm), p = 0.023, and 39% (n = 16, 192 ± 53 g / m²) of the cases (p = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cut-off values mentioned were determined by the ROC curve with a confidence interval of 95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NSVT was more common in patients with MWTLV &gt; 21 mm and LLLV &gt; 144 g/m² (8 of 13, 62%) than in those with (4 of 13, 31%) or without (1 of 13; 8%) echocardiographic variables above cut-off values (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In HCM, occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> by Holter was associated with the degree of LVH assessed by echocardiography through MWT and BMI </plain></SENT>
