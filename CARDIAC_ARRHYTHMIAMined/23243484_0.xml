<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are few animal models of AF associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we describe the in vivo electrophysiological characteristics and histopathology of a mouse model of <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> that develops AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Myostatin is a well-known negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth that was recently found to additionally regulate cardiac muscle growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using cardiac-specific expression of the inhibitory myostatin pro-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, we generated transgenic (TG) mice with dominant-negative regulation of MSTN (DN-MSTN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One line (DN-MSTN TG13) displayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001714'>ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo>, as well as spontaneous AF on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG), and was further evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DN-MSTN TG13 had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> systolic function, but displayed atrial enlargement on cardiac MRI, as well as atrial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Baseline ECG revealed an increased P wave duration and QRS interval compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermate (WT) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven of 19 DN-MSTN TG13 mice had spontaneous or inducible AF, while none of the WT mice had atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Connexin40 (Cx40) was decreased in DN-MSTN TG13 mice, even in the absence of AF or significant atrial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, raising the possibility that MSTN signaling may play a role in Cx40 down-regulation and the development of AF in this mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, DN-MSTN TG13 mice represent a novel model of AF, in which molecular changes including an initial loss of Cx40 are noted prior to <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and the development of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
