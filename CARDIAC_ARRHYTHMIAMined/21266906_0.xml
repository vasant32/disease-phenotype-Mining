<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the potential benefits remain unclear and safety concerns persist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A systematic literature review identified 29 studies incorporating 2,355 patients: 1,181 (50.1%) who underwent cardiac surgery with CECC and 1,174 (49.9%) with mECC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These were meta-analyzed using random effects modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneity</z:hpo>, subgroup analysis, and risk of bias were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary endpoints were 30-day mortality, neurovascular compromise, and end organ dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints were length of stay and transfusion burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Miniaturized extracorporeal circulation significantly reduced postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (p = 0.03), but no significant difference in 30-day mortality, neurocognitive disturbance, cerebrovascular events, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Miniaturized extracorporeal circulation also significantly reduced mean blood loss (p &lt; 0.00001) and number of patients transfused (p &lt; 0.00001); however, duration of hospitalization, units transfused per patient, chest tube drainage, and revision for rebleeding remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis of larger studies (10 studies, n â‰¥ 31) showed mECC to significantly reduce ventilation period, hospital stay, and intensive care unit (ICU) stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similarly, a significant reduction in neurocognitive disturbance was seen in studies with closely matched demographic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Miniaturized extracorporeal circulation is not associated with increased cerebrovascular injury and may confer an advantage, reducing postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, blood loss, and transfusion burden </plain></SENT>
