<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to explore normative regulatory profiles and associated physiological and behavioral processes in order to further our understanding of what constitutes regulation in this dyadic context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined physiological patterns-vagal tone, indexed by respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA)-while mothers maintained a neutral expression over the course of the still face episode, as well as differential reactivity patterns in mothers with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> symptoms compared to non-depressed mothers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Behavioral and physiological data were collected from mothers of 5-month-old infants during the emotion suppression phase of the Still-Face Paradigm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used Hierarchical Linear Modeling to examine changes in mothers' RSA during infant distress and explored maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> as a predictor of physiological profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mothers were generally able to maintain a neutral expression and simultaneously demonstrated a mean-level increase in RSA during the still face episode compared to baseline, indicating an active regulatory response overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A more detailed time-course examination of RSA trajectories revealed that an initial RSA increase was typically followed by a decrease in response to peak infant distress, suggesting a physiological mobilization response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, this was not true of mothers with elevated depressive symptoms, who showed no change in RSA during infant distress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These distinct patterns of infant distress-related physiological activation may help to explain differences in maternal sensitivity and adaptive parenting </plain></SENT>
