<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, controlled study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A tertiary care center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: One hundred twenty children undergoing corrective surgery for TOF using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Group 1 received 100 mg/kg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16586">EACA</z:chebi> after induction, upon initiation of CPB, and after protamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group 2 received 75 mg/kg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16586">EACA</z:chebi> after induction, followed by a maintenance infusion of 75 mg/kg/h until chest closure, and an additional 75 mg/kg upon initiation of CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group 3 did not receive any <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48675">antifibrinolytic agent</z:chebi> or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: Cumulative mean blood loss, total packed red blood cells, and fresh frozen plasma requirements were significantly less in group 2 (p ≤ 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the total platelet concentrate transfused, re-exploration rate, incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, neurologic complications, mortality, or length of intensive care unit stay among the 3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidences of perioperative ST/T changes and chest closure time were significantly less in group 1 and group 2 (p ≤ 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The duration of mechanical ventilation was significantly less in group 2 (p ≤ 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16586">EACA</z:chebi> was effective in reducing the postoperative blood loss and transfusion requirements in children undergoing corrective cardiac surgery on CPB for TOF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The dose regimen of 75 mg/kg after induction, followed by a maintenance infusion of 75 mg/kg/h until chest closure, and an additional 75 mg/kg upon initiation of CPB were more effective </plain></SENT>
