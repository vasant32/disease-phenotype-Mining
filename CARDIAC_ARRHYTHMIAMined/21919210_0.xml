<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we designed and synthesized a series of derivatives of the class III antiarrhythmic agent E-4031 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These compounds where evaluated in a radioligand binding assay and automated patch clamp assay to establish structure-activity relationships (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SAR</z:e>) for their inhibition of the hERG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Structural modifications of E-4031 were made by altering the peripheral aromatic moieties with a series of distinct substituents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we synthesized several derivatives with a quaternary nitrogen and modified the center of the molecule by introduction of an additional nitrogen and deletion of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi> oxygen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some modifications caused a great increase in affinity for the hERG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channel, while other seemingly minor changes led to a strongly diminished affinity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Structures with quaternary <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amines</z:chebi> carrying an additional aromatic moiety were found to be highly active in radioligand binding assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A decrease in affinity was achieved by introducing an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">amide</z:chebi> functionality in the central scaffold without directly interfering with the pK(a) of the essential basic <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The knowledge gained from this study could be used in early stages of drug discovery and drug development to avoid or circumvent hERG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channel blockade, thereby reducing the risk of cardiotoxicity, related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
