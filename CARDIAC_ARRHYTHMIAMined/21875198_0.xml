<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While emotional regulatory abilities are likely to influence emotional exchanges between parents and teens, surprisingly little is known about the role of emotion regulation during parent-child interactions, particularly in high-risk families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA) has been widely linked to emotion regulatory abilities in recent research, and the current study investigated RSA and maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in relation to dyadic flexibility, as well as mutuality of negative and positive affect displayed during three discussion tasks between 59 mother-adolescent pairs (age 11-17 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dyadic flexibility was predicted by the interaction of maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, maternal RSA, and teen RSA, with higher maternal RSA predicting greater dyadic flexibility, particularly in highest risk dyads (i.e., elevated maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and lower teen RSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Teen RSA interacted with maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> to predict mutual negative affect, serving as a protective factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, maternal and teen RSA interacted to predict mutual positive affect, with maternal RSA buffering against low teen RSA to predict higher mutual positive affect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results support the role of RSA in affectively laden interactions between parents and adolescents, particularly in the face of maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
