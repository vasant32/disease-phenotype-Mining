<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the pause-dependency of the J-wave to characterize this phenomenon in idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The J-wave can be found in apparently healthy subjects and in patients at risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo>, and risk stratification is therefore needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty patients with J-wave-associated idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> were studied for J waves with special reference concerning pause-dependent augmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>J waves were defined as those ≥0.1 mV above the isoelectric line and were compared with 76 non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> patients of comparable age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The J-wave was larger in patients with idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> than in the controls: 0.360 ± 0.181 mV versus 0.192 ± 0.064 mV (p = 0.0011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>J waves were augmented during storms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> (n = 9 [22.5%]), which was controlled by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi>; they disappeared within weeks in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, sudden prolongation of the R-R interval was observed in 27 patients induced by benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and 15 patients (55.6%) demonstrated pause-dependent augmentation (from 0.391 ± 0.126 mV to 0.549 ± 0.220 mV; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the other 12 experimental subjects and in the 76 control subjects, J waves remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pause-dependent augmentation of J waves was detected in 55.6% (sensitivity) but was specific (100%) in the patients with idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> with high positive (100%) and negative (86.4%) predictive values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pause-dependent augmentation of J waves was confirmed in about one-half of the patients with idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> after sudden R-R prolongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Such dynamicity of J waves was specific to idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> and may be used for risk stratification </plain></SENT>
