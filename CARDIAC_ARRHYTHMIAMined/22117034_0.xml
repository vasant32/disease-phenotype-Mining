<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this clinical setting, no study has investigated the impact of right atrium anatomical parameters on both CRT implantation procedure duration and X-ray exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, only few studies have examined the coronary sinus (CS) using dual-source 64-multi-slice computed tomography (DS 64-MSCT), and its impact on CRT procedure parameters has not yet been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this prospective study was to identify local anatomical predictive factors of difficult CRT implantation procedure using DS 64-MSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Between January and July 2010, 50 consecutive patients underwent primo CRT implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient population had a mean age of 70 ± 10 years, and was 34% female, with New York Heart Association Class 3.2 ± 0.3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, left ventricle ejection fraction 30 ± 4%, and QRS width 157 ± 30 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardiac resynchronization therapy implantation was attempted in 50 patients, and first LV lead implantation was obtained in 49 of 50 patients (98% primary success) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One implantation failed (2%) due to unsuccessful LV lead implant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Procedure parameters were as follows: LV threshold, 1.4 ± 0.8 V; LV wave amplitude, 17 ± 8 mV; LV impedance, 830 ± 240 Ω; median procedure time (skin to skin), 51 min (38 min); median fluoroscopy procedure time, 11.9 min (22 min); and median LV fluoroscopic time, 10.3 min (22 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 10 patients (20%), procedures were difficult requiring an implantation lasting ≥ 85 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The only predictive factor for difficult CRT implantation was the insertion level of the CS ostium (<z:chebi fb="97" ids="48272">CSO</z:chebi>), evaluated by the distance between the <z:chebi fb="97" ids="48272">CSO</z:chebi> and the bottom floor of the right atrium (14.8 ± 4 vs. 9.5 ± 4; P= 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neither the <z:mp ids='MP_0004062'>right atrium dilation</z:mp> nor right ventricular dysfunction was associated with difficult CRT implantation procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Today, despite improvements in the materials used, problems still remain in the CRT procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In this clinical setting, the only predictive factor for very long CRT procedures is the <z:chebi fb="97" ids="48272">CSO</z:chebi>-level insertion (located high) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This anatomical anomaly identified by DS 64-MSCT prior to surgery is responsible for 20% of difficult CRT device implantation procedures </plain></SENT>
