<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two agents, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3061">bepridil</z:chebi>, in achieving conversion to sinus rhythm in patients with persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">Amiodarone</z:chebi> (A) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3061">bepridil</z:chebi> (B) was administered to 40 consecutive patients (36 male subjects, age 61 years) with persistent AF in a prospective, randomised, open label fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pharmacological effects in bringing about conversion to sinus rhythm and subsequently maintaining sinus rhythm were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If sinus rhythm was not restored within 3 months, direct current (DC) cardioversion was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of adverse effects was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sinus rhythm was restored in seven (35%) of 20 patients in group A (average follow-up of 3.2 months) and in 17 (85%) of 20 in group B (average follow-up of 2.3 months) (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After pharmacological or DC cardioversion, sinus rhythm could be maintained in 10 (50%) of 20 patients in group A (average follow-up of 14.7 months) and 15 (75%) of 20 patients in group B (average follow-up of 15.6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>QT interval and QTc were significantly prolonged compare with the baseline values in group B, but no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsade de pointes</z:hpo> was recognised in any of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient in the group B developed interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, but steroid therapy cured the condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3061">Bepridil</z:chebi> was superior to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> in achieving sinus conversion and in maintaining sinus rhythm after cardioversion in patients with persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Even so, we must be watchful for potentially serious adverse complications when administering <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3061">bepridil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
