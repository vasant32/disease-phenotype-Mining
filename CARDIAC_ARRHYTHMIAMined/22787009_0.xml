<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent studies have identified the presence of familial clustering of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) as a clinical expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether nonischemic SCD has a similar familial background, which would be evidence of a genetic predisposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The retrospective case-control study included (1) consecutive victims of nonischemic SCD (n=223), (2) consecutive victims of ischemic SCD (n=596), whose <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and diagnosis were verified at medicolegal autopsy, and (3) control subjects without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> (n=475) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each study group, the family history of SCD among the first-degree relatives was determined and verified from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of SCD in â‰¥1 first-degree relative was significantly higher in victims of ischemic (34.2%) than nonischemic SCD (13.4%; P&lt;0.001) or controls (17.6%; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The history of SCD in first-degree relatives did not differ from controls in nonischemic SCD victims (P=0.155) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a subgroup analysis of victims of ischemic SCD, the prevalence of family history of SCD in first-degree relatives did not differ between those with or without a prior <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> scar at autopsy (33.1% versus 29.9%, respectively; P=0.222) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ischemic SCD has a strong familial background both in cases with and without a prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The family history of SCD is not significantly increased in victims of nonischemic SCD, suggesting a larger role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> occurrence than inherited traits as the cause of nonischemic SCD </plain></SENT>
