<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Anticoagulation Use Evaluation and Life Threatening Events Sentinels (ANGELS) of AF project was a medical care program aimed at supporting adherence to oral anticoagulation (OAC) guidelines for thromboprophylaxis through the use of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> AF diagnostics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty Italian cardiology clinics followed 3438 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a subgroup of 15 centers (the ANGELS of AF centers), cardiologists attending to follow-up visits were supplied with specific reports describing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors and risk scores (American College of Chest Physicians and CHADS(2) [<z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, age â‰¥75 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, and prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>]), AF occurrence and duration, and current antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF, especially those with a CHADS(2) score &gt;0 and not on OAC therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining centers represented a control group of patients as a comparison of OAC use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the ANGELS of AF centers, 709 (36%) patients had AF described either in their clinical history (n=426 [22%]) or as new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF (n=257 [14%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 683 (96%) patients with CHADS2 score &gt;0, 209 (30.6%) were not taking an OAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Appropriate OAC therapy was prescribed in 10% (22/209) of patients after evaluation of ANGELS of AF reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percentage of patients on OAC therapy, as indicated by guidelines, increased during follow-up from 46.1% at baseline, to 69.4% at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk evaluation phase, to up to 72.6% at the end of the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In control centers, corresponding figures were 46.9% at baseline and 56.8% at the end of the observation period (P&lt;0.001 versus ANGELS of AF group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The ANGELS of AF project demonstrates the possibility to improve OAC use in accordance with available guidelines for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk reduction in AF by supplying attending physicians with reports about patients risk factors and AF information from continuous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> monitoring </plain></SENT>
