<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: While randomised, controlled trials have established the efficacy of the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) for primary and secondary prevention of life threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, psychosocial responses remain complex and poorly understood, especially across Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There appears to be a greater need to understand differences in the experience of men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim of this prospective study was to explore differences in psychosocial adjustment over a 12 month period following <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen female and thirty three male device recipients completed a series of questionnaires over a 12 month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Instruments included a generic and an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> specific Quality of Life (QOL) measure and the state-trait <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> inventory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Women reported higher levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> than men at discharge but over time demonstrated a significant improvement such that at 4, 8 and 12 months men were more anxious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Women reported significantly poorer emotional wellbeing at discharge, however by 12 months this was significantly improved with no difference in the perceptions held by men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Women consistently across the 12 months worried more than men about the impact of the device on appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study confirmed that most individuals adjust positively to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> during the first 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Some gender differences in adjustment were evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies across Europe are warranted to establish gender specific interventions to support men and women as they adapt to life with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implants </plain></SENT>
