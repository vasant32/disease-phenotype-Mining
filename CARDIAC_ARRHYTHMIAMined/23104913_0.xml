<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used a realistic large-scale computer model to evaluate the effects of uncoupling with and without left-sided block and in combination with biventricular pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Action potential propagation was simulated using a reaction-diffusion model of the human ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiograms and cardiac electrograms were computed from the simulated action potentials by solving the bidomain equations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> situations, diffuse uncoupling reduced QRS amplitude, prolonged QRS duration, and rotated the QRS axis leftward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Uncoupling by 50% increased QRS duration from 90 to 120 ms with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conduction system and from 140 to 190 ms when the left bundle branch was blocked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biventricular pacing did not change QRS duration but reduced total ventricular activation time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Uncoupling in the working myocardium can mimic left-sided block in the ventricular conduction system and can explain an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> ECG pattern with relatively low amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Biventricular pacing improves ventricular activation in true <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> with or without uncoupling but not in case of 50% uncoupling alone </plain></SENT>
