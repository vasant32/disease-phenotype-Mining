<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that M-2, an active and final metabolite of furnidipine, had cardioprotective effects without the marked cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> seen with this <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50075">dihydropyridine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the influence of M-2 infusion (10(-7) M) on hemodynamics during low-flow and regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the rat working heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the protection conferred by M-2 infusion (10(-7) M) against effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28051">veratridine</z:chebi>-induced intracellular calcium overload in the Langendorff heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we performed an in vivo study to explore the effects of oral administration of M-2 at different times and doses, in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>- and reperfusion-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>M-2 improved coronary flow during low-flow and regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> while favorably maintaining aortic pressure parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>M-2 provided outstanding protection against deleterious effects of calcium overloading by significantly preventing rise in left ventricular diastolic pressure and decrease in coronary flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>M-2 reduced mortality and incidence and duration of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> while exhibiting differential influence on blood pressure, which depended on dose and time of administration and could suggest its clinical indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of our entire study establish a beneficial cardioprotective role of M-2, which exhibited pleiotropic effects on the ischemic heart by imparting protection in various ways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This combined with good tolerance, long duration of action, low toxicity, and relatively large therapeutic window makes M-2 a promising candidate as a precursor for a new chemical class of cardioprotective drugs </plain></SENT>
