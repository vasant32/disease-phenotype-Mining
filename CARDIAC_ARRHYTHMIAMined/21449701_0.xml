<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> presents a thermal stability of up to 431 K and a fusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> temperature of 432 K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The drug has proven to be incompatible with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9254">magnesium stearate</z:chebi>, eskis red pigment, and yellow <z:chebi fb="27" ids="50820">iron oxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, this drug presented degradation upon undergoing basic hydrolysis and oxidation; the degradation product produced under basic hydrolysis is 2-butyl-3-benzofuranyl-3,4-dihydroxy-5-iodophenylketone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Assessing the degradation kinetics, the drug presented a shelf life (t₉₀) of 43 years, while a pharmaceutical formulation showed a t₉₀ of 1.7 years, which is consistent with commonly understood incompatibilities in pharmaceutical formulations </plain></SENT>
