<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main goal of study was to compare levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor a, interleukin 6 and interleukin 4 in hypertensive patients with and without ventricular rhythm disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study included 100 cases, 50 of those had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor a, interleukin 6 and interleukin 4 were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Possible connections of above mentioned biomarkers with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, blood pressure, echocardiography left ventricle data were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Higher level of biomarkers was associated with presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>; higher rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>ventricular extrasystoles</z:hpo> was accompanied with insignificantly lower biomarker level </plain></SENT>
