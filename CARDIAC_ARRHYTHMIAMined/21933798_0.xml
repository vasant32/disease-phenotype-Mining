<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: It is not clear whether cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) should only be optimized at rest or whether it is necessary to perform CRT optimization during exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our study aims to answer this question by using an inert gas rebreathing method (Innocor®) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> and implanted CRT devices were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aetiology of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> was ischaemic in nine (33%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients had low left ventricular ejection fraction (29 ± 8%) and enlarged LV end-diastolic diameters (63 ± 7 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Atrioventricular delay (AVD) was optimized at rest according to cardiac index (CI), measured by inert gas rebreathing (Innocor®) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, patients performed standardized, steady-state bicycle exercise at 30 W in sitting body position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three AVDs were tested during exercise in a random sequence: optimized resting AVD (AVD(opt)) according to baseline measurement; AVD(opt) - 30 ms; and AVD(opt) + 30 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cardiac index was measured in each AVD by inert gas rebreathing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cardiac index increased significantly during exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, neither AVD(opt) shortening nor prolongation during exercise had significant effect on CI (shortening of AVD(opt) - 30 ms was accompanied by a reduction of CI of 4.8%, prolongation of AVD(opt) + 30 ms was accompanied by a reduction of CI of 7.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Shortening or lengthening of the AVD during exercise has no impact on CI in CRT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On the basis of our results, we conclude that in CRT patients the AVD should be programmed, fixed even during exercise </plain></SENT>
