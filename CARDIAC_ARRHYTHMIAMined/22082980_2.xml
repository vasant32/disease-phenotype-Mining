<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the capacity and reproducibility of three-dimensional echocardiographic (3DE) strain parameters in the assessment of global left ventricular (LV) systolic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 128 subjects with differing LV ejection fractions were investigated using two-dimensional echocardiographic (2DE) and 3DE strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional echocardiographic strain allows obtaining longitudinal, circumferential, radial, and area strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First, values of global longitudinal strain (GLS) by 2DE and 3DE speckle-tracking analyses were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, 3DE strain parameters were correlated with LV ejection fraction and indexed output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Last, the variability of 3DE versus 2DE strain measurements as well as recorded time of analysis were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After excluding 21 patients for insufficient image quality, four for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, two for severe valvular disease, and one for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo>, the final population consisted of 100 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparison between 2DE and 3DE GLS revealed high correspondence (r = 0.91, y = 1.04x - 0.71) and mean error measurement of -1.3% (95% confidence interval, -5.7 to 3.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among strain parameters, global area strain exhibited the highest correlation with LV ejection fraction (y = -1.65 + 10.4, r = -0.92, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intraobserver measurement variability proved acceptable: 8% for GLS (vs 6% on 2DE analysis), 7% for circumferential strain (vs 15% on 2DE analysis), 7% for radial strain (vs 33% on 2DE analysis), and 5% for global area strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean error between two measurements was lower with 3DE than 2DE analysis for circumferential and radial strains but similar for GLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean time of analysis was of 117 Â± 16 sec for 3DE analysis, which was 25% less than for 2DE analysis (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> strain parameters, new 3DE area strain correlated best with common LV systolic function parameters and is thus the most promising approach, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3DE strain markers exhibited good reproducibility </plain></SENT>
