<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have critically evaluated the functional consequences of expressing the CASQ2(D307H) mutant protein in the CASQ2 null mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recently reported that the mutant CASQ2(D307H) protein can be stably expressed in CASQ2 null hearts, and it targets appropriately to the junctional SR (Kalyanasundaram A, Bal NC, Franzini-Armstrong C, Knollmann BC, Periasamy M </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found that introduction of CASQ2(D307H) protein in the CASQ2 null background partially restored triadin 1 levels, which were decreased in the CASQ2 null mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite twofold expression (relative to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> CASQ2), the mutant protein failed to increase SR Ca(2+) load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also found that the Ca(2+) transient decays slower in the CASQ2 null and CASQ2(D307H) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CASQ2(D307H) myocytes, when rhythmically paced and challenged with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi>, exhibit spontaneous Ca(2+) waves similar to CASQ2 null myocytes; however, the stability of Ca(2+) cycling was increased in the CASQ2(D307H) myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi>, Ca(2+)-transient amplitude in CASQ2(D307H) myocytes was significantly decreased, possibly indicating an inherent defect in Ca(2+) buffering capacity and release from the mutant CASQ2 at high Ca(2+) concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also observed polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> in the CASQ2(D307H) mice, although lesser than in the CASQ2 null mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that CASQ2(D307H) point mutation may affect Ca(2+) buffering capacity and Ca(2+) release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We propose that poor interaction between CASQ2(D307H) and triadin 1 could affect <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor 2 stability, thereby increasing susceptibility to delayed afterdepolarizations and triggered arrhythmic activity </plain></SENT>
