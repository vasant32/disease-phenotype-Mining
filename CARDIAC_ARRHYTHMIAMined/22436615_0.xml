<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Venous spasm during contrast-guided axillary vein puncture has been reported rarely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the incidence of venous spasm during contrast-guided axillary vein puncture and the impact of venous spasm on axillary vein puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy-four consecutive patients referred for contrast-guided axillary vein puncture for pacemaker or defibrillator implantation were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The puncture was guided by ﬂuoroscopy and the venogram of axillary vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the success of puncture, the venography was taken again </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the puncture could not be successful up to 3 min, the second venography was taken and the puncture was guided by the second venogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The degree of venous spasm was evaluated by the reduction in the lumen calibre of the axillary vein after puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mild venous spasm and severe venous spasm were defined as a reduction in the lumen calibre of 50-90 and ≥ 90%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The success rate of axillary vein puncture within 3 min was 87.8%, and the total success rate was 95.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mild venous spasm occurred in 22 patients (29.7%) and severe venous spasm occurred in 6 patients (8.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Severe venous spasm occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the three patients with a failed puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Severe venous spasm was independently negatively correlated with both success rate within 3 min and total success rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Venous spasm is not a rare phenomenon during the contrast-guided puncture of axillary vein and it has an important negative impact on the puncture </plain></SENT>
