<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Material and methods Thirty permanent pacemaker implanted male patients, were enrolled to study between September 2006 and September 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Erectile function domain questions of International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-6) and Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale (HAD) questionnaires were applied to patients, 6 months before pacemaker implantation (BP6) and on month 1 (AP1) and 6 after application (AP6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were included in a multidisciplinary cardiac rehabilitation-adaptation program with a duration of 1-2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated in subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results Mean age was 51.5 ± 10.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most frequent diagnosis was observed as <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> in etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean IIEF values were changed 22.8→20.2→24.6 in BP6, AP1 and AP6 time frames consecutively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the mean HAD-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> scores were evaluated as 8.1→17.0→7.3 and the mean HAD-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> as 3.9→7.9→8.9 consecutively in the same time frames </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> plus permanent pacemaker implantation, increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of patients and decreased erectile function at AP1; however, the improvement in cardiac symptoms at AP6 with the possible positive effects of rehabilitation program, helps to reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and increased IIEF scores, although there was still a slight increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> levels </plain></SENT>
