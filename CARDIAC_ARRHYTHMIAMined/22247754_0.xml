<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Most individuals that receive implantable cardioverter-defibrillators never experience a life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genetic factors may help identify who is most at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> and extended follow-up were recruited from 34 clinical sites with the goal of oversampling those who had experienced LTA, with a cumulative 607 cases and 297 controls included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 1,006 Caucasian patients were enrolled during a time period of 13 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> status of 904 patients could be confirmed and their genomic data were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this cohort, there were 704 males, 200 females, and the average age was 73.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We genotyped DNA samples using the Illumina Human660 W Genotyping BeadChip and tested for association between genotype at common variants and the phenotype of having an LTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We did not find any associations reaching genome-wide significance, with the strongest association at chromosome 13, rs11856574 at P = 5×10⁻⁶ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Loci previously implicated in phenotypes such as QT interval (measure of the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave as measured by electrocardiogram) were not found to be significantly associated with having an LTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although powered to detect such associations, we did not find common genetic variants of large effect associated with having a LTA in those of European descent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This indicates that common gene variants cannot be used at this time to guide <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> risk-stratification </plain></SENT>
