<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients experienced waking hour hypoxemia, and eight of nineteen patients spent &gt; 10% of waking hours in hypoxemic state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most patients experienced frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, mostly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atrial premature contractions</z:e> (APCs) and <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular premature contractions</z:mp> (<z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPCs</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were significant correlation between the variables of 6MWT and hypoxemia during daily activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients who desaturated below 80% before 300 meters spent more than 10% of waking hour in hypoxemia (P = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to waking hour hypoxemia, SpO(2) did not drop significantly during sleep except in the patients whose daytime resting SpO(2) was already low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, patients with fibrotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ILD</z:e> showed significant period of hypoxemia during daily activities and frequent <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPCs</z:mp> and APCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six-minute walk test is a useful surrogate marker of waking hour hypoxemia and seems to be safe without continuous monitoring of SpO(2) </plain></SENT>
