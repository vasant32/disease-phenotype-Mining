<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of the study were to verify the conviction that outer <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> lead insulation is biostable and inert in addition to determining the role of macrophages (M) and Staphylococcus aureus (S aureus) strains in the <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> lead insulation degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results- Leads removed from 8 patients because of infective and noninfective indications were analyzed with stereomicroscope and classified according to Banacha <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0580209,C1456154,C1302752" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">abrasion</z:e> classification, and additional analysis using scanning electron microscope was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The examination revealed excavations of different shape and depth in the abraded areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fresh <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi>-insulated lead was cut into fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fragments were cultured with RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line for 9 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional lead fragments were placed with S aureus strains: ATCC 25923, ATCC 29213, and K9328H </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lead fragments were also cocultured with the <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> strains and RAW M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In scanning electron microscope analysis, diminution in <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> S aureus strains provoked insulation damage after 9 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The lowest level of degradation of insulation concerned ATCC 25923 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">Silicone</z:chebi> lead fragments in cocultures presented a further gone level of <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> biodegradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusions- S aureus, macrophages separately, and S aureus and macrophages cocultures initiate the biodegradation of <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> insulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Differences in the level of biodegradation between strains of S aureus were observed, with the most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1457883" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive reaction</z:e> toward <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> visible in the cocultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In vivo <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> biodegradation is initiated by tearing among surfaces of the lead insulation, macrophages may be the crucial cells for the process that may be aggravated by pathogen colonization </plain></SENT>
