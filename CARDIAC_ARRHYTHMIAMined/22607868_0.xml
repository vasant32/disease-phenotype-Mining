<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the clinical correlates and the effect of rhythm-control strategy on AF progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: RecordAF was a worldwide prospective survey of AF management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consecutive eligible patients with recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF were included and allocated to rate or rhythm control according to patient/physician choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 2,137 patients were followed up for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> progression was defined as a change from paroxysmal to persistent/permanent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Progression of AF occurred in 318 patients (15%) after 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with AF progression were older; had a higher diastolic blood pressure; and more often had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with rhythm control were less likely to show progression than those treated only with rate control (164/1542 [11%] vs 154/595 [26%], P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis showed that history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR] 2.2, 95% CI 1.7-2.9, P &lt; .0001), history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.0, P = .01), and rate control rather than rhythm control (OR 3.2, 95% CI 2.5-4.1, P &lt; .0001) were independent predictors of AF progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The propensity score-adjusted OR of AF progression in patients with rate rather than rhythm control was 3.3 (95% CI 2.4-4.6, P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> are associated with AF progression, rhythm control is associated with lower risk of AF progression </plain></SENT>
