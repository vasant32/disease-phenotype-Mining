<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To evaluate the clinical implication of right ventricular (RV) to left ventricular (LV) interlead sensed electrical delay (RV-LVs) and the relation to ventricular lead position in cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-five consecutive CRT patients (mean age 66 ± 11 years) received LV lead prospectively targeted to the latest mechanical activated segment (concordant), assessed by two-dimensional speckle tracking radial strain (ST-RS) echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The RV lead was randomized to RV apex (n= 43) or RV high posterior septum (n= 42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Right ventricular to left ventricular interlead sensed electrical delay was obtained during the CRT implant procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intraventricular dyssynchrony was evaluated by ST-RS echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interventricular mechanical delay (IVMD) was measured by using pulse-wave Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Separated by the median RV-LVs (82 ms), a long RV-LVs demonstrated more LV end-systolic volume (LVESV) reduction than a short RV-LVs (-27 ± 20 vs. -16 ± 22%; P= 0.02), 6 months after CRT (6FU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Right ventricular to left ventricular interlead sensed electrical delay correlated to IVMD (r = 0.50; P&lt; 0.001) and intraventricular dyssynchrony (r = 0.25; P= 0.02) at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concordant LV leads (n= 61) demonstrated superior reduction of LVESV (P= 0.005) 6 months after CRT; however, both RV lead positions had similar effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Right ventricular to left ventricular interlead sensed electrical delay was irrespective to LV lead concordance and RV lead position (P= ns) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors to reverse remodelling (reduction of LVESV ≥ 15%) at 6FU were concordant LV lead (odds ratio, 3.210; P= 0.029) and IVMD (odds ratio, 1.028; P= 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Right ventricular to left ventricular interlead sensed electrical delay was not predictive to LV reverse remodelling affected by CRT at 6FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Concordant LV leads demonstrated superior LV reverse remodelling at 6FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Right ventricular to left ventricular interlead sensed electrical delay was irrespective of ventricular lead position and might be insufficient to target optimal LV lead position in CRT </plain></SENT>
