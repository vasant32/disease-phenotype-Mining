<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many patients are admitted to the hospital to undergo transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> exclusion and subsequent electrical cardioversion (ECV) under deep sedation to restore sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated prospectively how workflow optimization can contribute to reducing time and costs in AF patients scheduled for ECV in an outpatient setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cardioversion unit (CU) was established and equipped to perform <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ECV-associated procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Between November 2007 and January 2009, ECV was performed in 115 patients in an outpatient setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three different settings were tested for ECV: (1) usual care (n = 19): preparation/follow-up in the outpatient clinic, blood testing in the central hospital laboratory (CHL), TEE in the echocardiography laboratory, and ECV in the intensive care unit; (2) optimized process 1 (n = 41): preparation/follow-up, TEE + ECV during one sedation in the CU, blood testing in the CHL; (3) optimized process 2 (n = 55): preparation/follow-up, TEE + ECV and point of care (POC) blood testing in the CU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> procedure-related costs were listed and classified according to material, human resources, and infrastructure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From setting 1 to 3, there was a significant decrease in procedural time from 480 ± 105 min to 205 ± 85 min (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Likewise, ECV-associated costs could be reduced from 683 ± 104 &lt;euro&gt; to 299 ± 63 &lt;euro&gt; (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Establishing a CU for AF enables a more than 50% reduction in procedural time and costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A combination of TEE and ECV in one sedation and POC testing in the CU were the major contributors to this time and cost reduction </plain></SENT>
