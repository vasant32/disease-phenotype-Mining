<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This implies that drugs that activate hERG as a side effect may likewise pose significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>hERG activators have been found to have diverse mechanisms of activation, which may reflect their distinct binding sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, the new hERG activator ICA-105574 was introduced, which disables inactivation of the hERG channel with very high potency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We explored characteristics of this new drug in several experimental models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patch clamp experiments were used to verify activation of hERG channels by ICA-105574 in human embryonic kidney cells stably-expressing hERG channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ICA-105574 significantly shortened QT and QTc intervals and monophasic action potential duration (MAP(90)) in Langendorff-perfused guinea-pig hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also administered ICA-105574 to anesthetized dogs while recording ECG and drug plasma concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ICA-105574 (10 mg/kg) significantly shortened QT and QTc intervals, with a free plasma concentration of approximately 1.7 µM at the point of maximal effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data showed that unbound ICA-105574 caused QT shortening in dogs at concentrations comparable to the half maximal effective concentration (EC(50), 0.42 µM) of hERG activation in the patch clamp studies </plain></SENT>
