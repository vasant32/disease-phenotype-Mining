<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the specificity of LGE-CMR for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) versus non-SCD is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this retrospective, observational study was to evaluate this relationship in a cohort of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results : We included consecutive patients who had undergone LGE-CMR before <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation over a 4-year period (2006-2009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Scar (defined as myocardium with a signal intensity ≥50% of the maximum in scar tissue) was characterized in terms of percent scar and number of transmural LV scar segments in a 17-segment model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The endpoints were appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixty-four patients (average age 66 ± 11 years, 51 male, median LVEF 30%) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During 42 ± 13 months follow-up, appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy occurred in 28 patients (44%), and 14 patients (22%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Number of transmural scar segments (P = 0.005) and percentage LV scar (P = 0.03) were both significantly associated with appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, neither number of transmural scar segments (P = 0.32) or percent LV scar (P = 0.59) was significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusion : In this observational study, in medium-term follow-up, the extent of LV scar characterized by LGE-CMR was strongly associated with the occurrence of spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that scar quantification by LGE-CMR may be more specific for SCD than non-SCD, and may prove a valuable tool for the selection of patients for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
