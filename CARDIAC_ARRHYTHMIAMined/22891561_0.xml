<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to determine the frequency of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> interventions in patients in the primary and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) prevention groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study involved 399 patients (334 male, 65 female), mean age was 65.2 +/- 12.1 years (21-89 years), who had an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implanted in years 2008-2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analysis comprised age, gender, indications for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation, intracardiac electrograms derived from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients were divided in 2 groups depending on the SCD prevention type: group A - primary prevention, group B - secondary prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the A group, the peak <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was in the 7th decade of life, while in the B group it was 10 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the A group the main condition was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary arteries disease</z:hpo> (CAD) (76%) and dilating non-ischemic cardiomiopathy (18%), whilst in the B group, only CAD (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the A group different forms of ventricular tachyarrhythmias were registered more often in the dead (57%), than living patients (38%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.025) and considered mainly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> observed in 21% of dead patients and only in 4,2% living </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact, that in the B group the percentage of dangerous ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT and especially <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) was higher, there were fewer <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> than in A group (7.8 vs 12.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In living patients in the B group, there were registered twice as many <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> interventions as in the A group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the A group, in patients over 70 years old, in contrary to the younger, more frequently ventricular tachyarrhythmias and antiarrhythmic interventions (ATP, CV) were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the B group, the relation was reversed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Inadequate and ineffective interventions occurred mainly in the A group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There were twice as many <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> interventions in patients implanted in secondary SCD prevention than in patients implanted in primary prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In secondary prevention, in contrary to the primary, the frequency of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> interventions in patients younger than 70 years old is higher than in older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The most frequent reason for inadequate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> interventions are <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
