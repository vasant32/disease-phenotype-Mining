<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Further, the influence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001948'>alkalosis</z:hpo> in reducing ionized calcium has been well known for a long time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the effects of different dialysate electrolytes and bicarbonate concentrations on changes of QTc interval in patients on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hemodialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study hemodialysis sessions were performed in 22 patients, with different electrolyte and bicarbonate concentrations in dialysate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tested dialysate concentrations were K of 2 and 3 mmol/L; Ca 1.25, 1.5 and 1.75 mmol/L; and bicarbonate 30 and 34 mmol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded 1 hour before, at the end and every hour for 4 hours after each study dialysis session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>QTc interval was measured from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of a T wave on a 12-lead ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood was collected and K, total Ca, ionic Ca and pH evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the end of the study hemodialysis session with dialysate containing low K (2 mmol/L), low Ca (1.25 mmol/L) and high bicarbonate concentration (34 mmol), mean QTc interval was significantly prolonged compared with that recorded with dialysate containing high K (3 mmol/L), high Ca (1.75 mmol/L) and bicarbonate (30 mmol) (40 ± 10 milliseconds vs. 2 ± 2 milliseconds; p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dialysate with low concentration of low Ca, K and high concentration of bicarbonate was an independent predictor of QTc; the combination of low Ca and K and high bicarbonate strongly increased the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005184'>prolonged QTc interval</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present pilot study shows that changes in QTc interval during hemodialysis depend on both electrolyte and bicarbonate concentrations in dialysate </plain></SENT>
