<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have hypothesized that left ventricular posterior wall thickness is an independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (PAF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 166 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another 166 healthy check-up people, strictly age and sex-matched, were enrolled as controls in the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariable analysis and multivariable conditional logistic stepwise regression analysis were conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed on those significant indices obtained from the multivariable logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The multivariable stepwise analysis identified left ventricular posterior wall thickness, left atrial diameter <z:hpo ids='HP_0005180'>tricuspid insufficiency</z:hpo> and residence (countryside) as independent predictors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated the cutoff values of those risk factors aforementioned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this strictly age and sex-matched population-based sample, left ventricular posterior wall thickness, left atrial diameter, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005180'>tricuspid insufficiency</z:hpo> and residence were predictive risks for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study offers novel information therapeutically beyond that provided by traditional clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> risk factors </plain></SENT>
