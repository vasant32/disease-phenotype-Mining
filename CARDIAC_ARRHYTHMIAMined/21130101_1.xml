<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have earlier shown in a mathematical model that myocardium mechanical activity may contribute to rhythm disturbances induced by Ca(2+) overload in cardiomyocytes with reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> pump work (Sulman et al., 2008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The same model is used here to address possible contribution of the passive mechanical properties of cardiac muscle (i.e. myocardial viscous and elastic properties) to the arrhythmogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a series of contractions at regular pacing rate of 75 beats/min a model with higher viscosity demonstrated essentially earlier appearance of <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>extrasystoles</z:mp> due to a faster cardiomyocyte Ca(2+) loading up to a level triggering spontaneous Ca(2+) releases from the sarcoplasmic reticulum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The model predicts that myocardial elasticity also may affect arrhythmogenesis in cardiomyocytes overloaded with Ca(2+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Contribution of the mechanical properties of the myocardial tissue to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> has been analyzed for wide ranges of both viscosity and elasticity coefficients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that myocardial viscoelastic properties may be a factor affecting Ca(2+) handling in cardiomyocytes and contributing to cardiac mechano-electric feedback in arrhythmogenesis </plain></SENT>
