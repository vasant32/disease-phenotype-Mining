<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The usefulness of dabigatran etexilate for the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: In this study the efficacy and safety of dabigatran etexilate for anticoagulation for AF ablation were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Patients were divided into three groups: Group 1, interrupted <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> bridged by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> between pre- and post-ablation; Group 2, continuous <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy; and Group 3, dabigatran etexilate therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation therapy with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> or dabigatran etexilate was performed from 30 days before to at least 90 days after AF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dabigatran etexilate was administered at 110 or 150 mg twice daily, depending on renal function and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients' clinical characteristics, associated disorders, echocardiographic parameters and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> status were not different among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Procedural parameters such as procedural time and radiofrequency energy supply were also not different among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The dabigatran etexilate group and the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> groups had no embolic complications (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pericardial tamponade</z:e> was observed in the dabigatran etexilate group, while two patients in each of Group 1 (2/194, 1.0 %) and Group 2 (2/203, 0.98 %) developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac tamponade</z:e>, though the differences were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>Pericardial effusion</z:hpo> and groin haematoma were observed in one patient each (1/105, 0.9 %) in the dabigatran etexilate group, and the incidences were not different from the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> group (Group 1: 4/194, 2.1 % and 2/194, 1.0 %; Group 2: 3/203, 1.5 % and 2/203, 1.0 %, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As a whole, the safety outcomes did not differ among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Dabigatran etexilate is an effective and safe anticoagulation therapy for AF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, dabigatran etexilate appears to be useful as an alternative <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> for AF ablation </plain></SENT>
