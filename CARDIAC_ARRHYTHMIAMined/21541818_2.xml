<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The safety of REG in large series of CKD patients in daily clinical practice remains unstudied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective study of patients with eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min (n = 411, Grp 1, CKD) were compared to patients with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min (n = 638, Grp 2, Control) undergoing REG-SPECT from Jan to Nov 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient demographics, REG-SPECT data, side effects, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> occurrences were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No major adverse events were noted immediately after REG-SPECT or at 1 week of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in between the two groups (Grp 1, 47.2% vs Grp 2, 42.9%, P = ns) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ninety-nine percent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in CKD patients were PACs or <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transient junctional rhythm was observed in one CKD patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no occurrences of second degree or higher degree <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Grp 1 had a blunted heart rate response (16.6 ± 16.1 vs 24.9 ± 20.3 bpm, P ≤ .001) and greater systolic blood pressure drop response (-7.4 ± 21.1 vs -1.4 ± 20.9 mm Hg, P ≤ .001) compared to Grp 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was more in Grp 2 (15.8% vs 22.6%, P ≤ .007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Aminophylline use to ward-off the side effects was comparable (9.5% vs 9.9%, P = ns) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: REG-SPECT can be safely performed in CKD non-dialysis patients with excellent tolerability, minimal side effects, and favorable hemodynamic responses compared to control group </plain></SENT>
