<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We tested proposed algorithms for idiopathic and nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> for their ability to identify epicardial LV-VT origins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several ECG features have been reported to identify epicardial origins for left <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardias</z:hpo> (LV-VTs) in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only limited data exist in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857175" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postinfarction</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The QRS features of 24 VTs that were ablated from the epicardium and 39 left ventricular VTs ablated from the endocardium were retrospectively analyzed for various 12-lead ECG features previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No ECG feature consistently predicted an epicardial LV-VT origin in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo>, with epicardial VTs showing slightly longer QRS durations (189 ± 32 ms in epicardial vs 179 ± 37 ms in endocardial, P = 0.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pseudo-delta duration was 38 ± 27 versus 47 ± 27 ms (P = 0.2), intrinsicoid deflection time 93 ± 35 versus 86 ± 32 ms (P = 0.4), shortest RS 97 ± 38 versus 99 ± 32 ms (P = 0.77), and median deflection index 0.82 ± 0.25 versus 0.87 ± 0.22 (P = 0.43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The finding of a Q wave in lead I and the absence of a Q wave in the inferior leads failed to predict an epicardial origin in superior LV-VT sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Q waves in any inferior lead and aVR/aVL-ratio&lt;1 were not specific for an epicardial origin in inferior sites (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P = ns) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> inferior LV-VTs showed a Q wave in the inferior leads which correlated with pre-existing Q-waves in sinus rhythm (P = 0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Proposed 12-lead ECG features for differentiation of epicardial versus endocardial sites for nonischemic LV-VTs do not reliably identify VTs that require ablation from the epicardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Endocardial mapping should be the first approach to catheter ablation for VTs in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
