<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The cardiac depolarization-repolarization process (D-REPP) may differ among various modes of cardiac pacing depending on the paced chamber(s) and lead position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We intended to assess the effect of different modes of cardiac pacing (left, right and biventricular) on the D-REPP as expressed in QRS, QT, peak-to-end of the T wave (PETW) and PETW/QT intervals and their dispersion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These intervals were compared during pacing and sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 31 patients without structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> and with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ventricular function who underwent right, left and biventricular pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous 12-leads were recorded and electronic calipers were used for measurement of the QRS, QT, corrected QT (cQT), PETW, and PETW/QT ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: cQT duration, PETW, standard deviation of the PETW, PETW/QT, and QRS duration were shorter during sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Isolated stimulation of the right or the left ventricle produced a similar increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the intervals and did not display significant differences in terms of cQT duration, PETW, PETW/QT, or QRS duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Biventricular pacing produced a significant increase in cQT, QRS, PETW and PETW/QT, but these values were shorter than those obtained during isolated right or left ventricular stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In subjects without structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, cardiac pacing produces a significant increase of the D-REPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No differences were found when comparing right or left univentricular pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Biventricular stimulation induces less perturbation of the D-REPP </plain></SENT>
