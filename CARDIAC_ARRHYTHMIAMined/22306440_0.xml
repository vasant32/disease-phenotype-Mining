<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Heart transplantation remains a resource-intensive therapy for children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, data regarding change in costs over time are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that hospital charges for pediatric heart transplant hospitalizations would increase from 1997 to 2006 and assessed factors associated with hospital charges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Database was performed on admissions surrounding heart transplantation for the years 1997, 2000, 2003, and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The database is a nationwide sampling of pediatric hospital discharges and is weighted to provide national estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 353 (95% confidence interval, 201-505) pediatric heart transplants in 1997 and 355 (95% confidence interval, 226-485) in 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean hospital charges increased from $279,399 in 1997 to $451,738 in 2006 (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This increase was similar to that observed for other pediatric surgical diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increases also occurred in morbidities, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> (p = 0.04) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> (p = 0.04), and in the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On multivariable analysis, greater hospital charges were associated with later calendar year (p = 0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (p = 0.03), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> (p = 0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> (p = 0.008), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (p = 0.03), and use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (p &lt; 0.001) and ventricular assist device (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: From 1997 to 2006, mean charges for pediatric heart transplant hospitalizations increased by &gt; $170,000 (160%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although greater morbidities in the later years of the study potentially contributed to increased charges, later calendar year was independently associated with increased charges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The changes in charges for heart transplant are similar to the increases seen in other surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ongoing study of management strategies is needed to determine cost-effective therapies for this complex group of patients </plain></SENT>
