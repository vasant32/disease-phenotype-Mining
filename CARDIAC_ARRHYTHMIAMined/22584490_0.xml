<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, in our institution, the results of RFA in children younger than 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 125 children submitted to RFA between May 1991 and May 2010 were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-seven (53.6%) children were males, aged between 44 days and 15 years (mean 8.6 ± 3.3 years) with median weight of 31 kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Heart disease</z:e> was present in 21 (16.8%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The RFA of accessory pathways (AP) was the most common procedure (62 children - 49.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The RFA of nodal reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (NRT) was the second most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in 27 (21.6%), followed by atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AT) in 16 (12.8%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardias</z:hpo> (VT) in 8 (6.4%) children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The success criteria were achieved in 86.9%, 96.1%, 80% and 62.5% of patients undergoing RFA of AP, NRT, AT and VT, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transient AVB occurred during RFA in 4 (3.2%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> in 7 (5.6%) children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five children underwent a new RFA due to initial failure or recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During the mean follow up of 5.5 ± 3.4 years, 107 (88.4%) remained without recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference regarding the results and the age at which the patient underwent the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No child had persistent AVB or required a permanent pacemaker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Catheter ablation is a safe and effective alternative therapy in children with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> refractory to medical treatment </plain></SENT>
