<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical data of 59 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e>, who underwent thoracoscopic resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> during April 2010 to April 2011, were reviewed and analyzed retrospectively to evaluate the operation time, lymph node dissection and metastatic nodes, post-operative complications, and comparison of the pre- and post-operative TNM staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 9 cases of the upper thoracic esophagus, 44 of the thoracic segment esophagus, and 6 of the lower thoracic segment esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One case of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and 1 case of esophageal small cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were treated by 2 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were in semi-prone position, and an artificial pneunothorax was created with injection of <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2 </z:chebi>(at a pressure of 6 - 8 mmHg) via the trocar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The entire thoracic esophagus was dissociated, mediastinal lymph nodes dissected by thoracoscopy, stomach dissociated, abdominal lymph nodes were dissected through abdominal incision, and esophagogastric anastomosis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 59 patients, 51 patients completed the thoracoscopic surgery, and 8 were converted to thoracotomy, due to azygos arch <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in two cases, membranous tracheal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> in one case, inferior vena cava <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in one case, bronchial artery <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in one case, and dense <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pleural adhesions</z:e> in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average operation time of the thoracoscopic surgery was 220.3 (180 - 330) min, and the average operation time for the operation in the thoracic part was 96.6 (80 - 120) min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average blood loss was 220.8 (100 - 300) ml, the postoperative chest tube was placed for 2 to 4 days (average 3.2), postoperative drainage volume was: 60 - 300 ml (201.6 ml in average) in the 1st day, 30 - 280 ml in the 2nd day, and 0 - 160 ml in the 3rd day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The length of hospital stay was 11.5 days (9 - 14 d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No mortality, anastomotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010310'>chylothorax</z:hpo> occurred in our patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, two cases of transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001609'>hoarseness</z:hpo>, and two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006532'>pulmonary infection</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> improved under symptomatic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The overall complication rate was 9.8% (5/51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>714 lymph nodes were dissected in the 51 patient-group, with an average 14 lymph nodes per patient, including 512 chest lymph nodes (10 on average) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The pathology report showed right recurrent laryngeal nerve lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> in 6 cases, left recurrent laryngeal nerve lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> in 3 cases, subcarinal lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> in 2 cases, lesion lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> in 1 case, and esophagogastric junction lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> in 1 case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) conducted in semi-prone position combined with artificial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo> for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> is technically feasible and safe, as effective as open thoracic surgery, not only to maintain the intact thorax, significantly lighter postoperative pain, and reduces perioperative complication, but also better wound appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The operation is welcomed by patients and meets the requirements of the development of esophageal surgery, and it is a quite ideal treatment of early and intermediate stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
