<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapies have met with limited success, in part due to an incomplete understanding of the underlying mechanisms for AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AF is traditionally characterized by spatiotemporally disorganized electrical activation and, although initiating triggers for AF are described, it is unclear whether AF is sustained by spatially meandering continuous excitation (re-entrant waves), localized electrical sources within the atria, or some other mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This has limited therapeutic options for this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we show that human AF is predominantly caused by a small number (1.8 Â± 0.9) of localized re-entrant waves or repetitive focal beats, that remain stable with limited spatial migration over prolonged periods of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency ablation that selectively targeted the sites of these sources was able to immediately terminate <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> and eliminate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> with high success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results show that human AF, despite apparent spatiotemporal disorganization, is often perpetuated by a few spatially-constrained and temporally conserved sources whose targeted ablation can eliminate this complex rhythm disorder </plain></SENT>
