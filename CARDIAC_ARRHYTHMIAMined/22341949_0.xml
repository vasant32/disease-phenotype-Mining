<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The treatment of familial amyloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathies</z:hpo> (FAP) is complex and requires a neurological and cardiological multidisciplinary coverage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It includes specific treatments to control the progression of the systemic amyloidogenesis, the symptomatic treatment of the peripheral and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0259749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic neuropathy</z:e> (digestive, urinary, sexual, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>postural hypotension</z:hpo>) and the treatment of organs severely involved by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> (heart, eyes, kidneys) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First line specific treatment of met30 TTR-FAP is liver transplantation (LT) which allows to suppress the main source of mutant TTR, to stop the progression of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> in 70 % of cases at long-term (with an experience of 18 years) and to double the median survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In case of severe renal or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac insufficiency</z:hpo>, a double transplant kidney-liver or heart-liver can be discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The tafamidis (in temporary authorization of use in France) is a stabilizing medicine of the tetrameric TTR which showed in very early stages of met30 TTR-FAP short-term capacities to stop the progress of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> in 60 % of the cases versus 38 % with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It should be proposed in case of contraindication of TH (age&gt;70 years [20 % of the cases]), of very early stages (very low <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53204">NIS</z:chebi>-LL score), or for the period of wait of LT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other innovative medicines issued from biopharmaceutical companies have been developed to block the hepatic production of both mutant and wild TTR which are noxious in the late forms NAH (&gt;50 years old) (RNAi [<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference] therapeutics, AntiSens oligonucleotids), for removing the amyloid deposits (monoclonal antibody anti-SAP), or to slow down the formation of deposits of TTR and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> (combination of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi>-TUDCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials should be first addressed to the patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> of FAP or non-met30 TTR-FAP who are less responding to LT and patients with contraindications in the LT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Initial cardiac assessment and periodic cardiac investigations are important for the FAP according to the frequency of cardiac impairment which is responsible of high rate of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Conduction disorders</z:e> (atrio-ventricular blocks) require the implantation of a pacemaker in about one third of the cases during the evolution of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A myocardial infiltration is detected in two third of the cases and is for a long time latent; it remains often limited to a diastolic dysfunction which can be responsible for hemodynamical difficulties during the LT; it evolves sometimes, late, towards a systolic dysfunction of bad prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A combined liver-heart transplantation is proposed in cases of severe cardiac involvement which are contraindication to the LT only, essentially in forms "not met30" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In every case of FAP, a regular cardiological follow-up is required for life, because of the progress of the cardiac involvement, which is not always stopped by the liver transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The symptomatic treatments are indispensable to improve the quality of life of the patients: neurogenic pains, urinary disorders, liqueurs, sexual <z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>impotence</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>postural hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The familial screening of the carriers of the TTR gene mutation and their regular follow-up by appropriate clinical examination and complementary investigations are major to detect early the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease to start as soon as possible specific therapy </plain></SENT>
