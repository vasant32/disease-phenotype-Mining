<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We developed an application for Android™-based mobile devices that allows real-time electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring and automated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> detection by analyzing ECG parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ECG data provided by pre-recorded files or acquired live by accessing a Shimmer™ sensor node via Bluetooth™ can be processed and evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The application is based on the Pan-Tompkins algorithm for QRS-detection and contains further algorithm blocks to detect <z:mp ids='MP_0004085'>abnormal heartbeats</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The algorithm was validated using the <z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi>-BIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi>-BIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>Supraventricular Arrhythmia</z:hpo> databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More than 99% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> QRS complexes were detected correctly by the algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall sensitivity for abnormal beat detection was 89.5% with a specificity of 80.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The application is available for download and may be used for real-time ECG-monitoring on mobile devices </plain></SENT>
