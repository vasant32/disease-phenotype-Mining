<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background- Although cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) can improve left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), it is not known whether a specific level of improvement will predict future implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results- CRT-defibrillator (CRT-D) was implanted in 423 patients at 1 institution between October 2, 2001 and January 19, 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between post-CRT-D LVEF and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy for ventricular tachyarrhythmias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A landmark population of 270 patients, with post-CRT-D LVEF measured and no <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy within 1 year of device implantation, was followed for subsequent outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, 22 patients (8.2%) had subsequent appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy over a median follow-up of 1.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The estimated 2-year risk of appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy is 3.0% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0%-6.3%), 2.1% (95% CI, 0%-5.0%), and 1.5% (95% CI, 0%-3.9%) for post-CRT-D LVEF of 45%, 50%, and 55%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with a primary prevention indication for CRT-D, the estimated 2-year risk is 3.3% (95% CI, 0%-7.3%), 2.5% (95% CI, 0%-6.1%), and 1.9% (95% CI, 0%-5.1%) for post-CRT-D LVEF of 45%, 50%, and 55%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusions- When a CRT responder demonstrates near normalization in LVEF to â‰¥45%, the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> becomes low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Future studies are needed to determine whether an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> is still needed in some of these patients at the time of generator replacement </plain></SENT>
