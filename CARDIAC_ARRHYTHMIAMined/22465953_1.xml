<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SIRT1 activity is negatively regulated by DBC1 (Deleted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>Breast Cancer</z:hpo> 1) through direct binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, how the DBC1-SIRT1 interaction is regulated remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that the DBC1-SIRT1 interaction increases following DNA damage and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The stress-induced DBC1-SIRT1 interaction requires the ATM-dependent phosphorylation of DBC1 at Thr 454, which creates a second binding site for SIRT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, we showed that the stress-induced DBC1-SIRT1 interaction is important for cell fate determination following genotoxic stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results revealed a novel mechanism of SIRT1 regulation during genotoxic stress </plain></SENT>
