<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have demonstrated evidence of an association between OSA and a number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis in OSA may be due to enhanced vagal output triggered by a combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> and hypoxemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This case demonstrates a dose-dependent reduction in atrial ectopy with increasing continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in the setting of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
