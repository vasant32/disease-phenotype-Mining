<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a proof of concept we explored multiplex targeted high-throughput sequencing as a fast and cost-efficient diagnostic method for individuals suffering from mendelian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We designed a DNA capture assay including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> exons from 130 genes involved in cardiovascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1285355" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mendelian disorders</z:e> and analysed simultaneously 4 samples by multiplexing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients had familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) and 2 patients suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long-QT syndrome</z:hpo> (LQTS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patient 1 with HCM, we identified two known pathogenic missense variants in the two most frequently mutated sarcomeric genes MYH7 and MYBPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patient 2 with HCM, a known acceptor splice site variant in MYBPC3 was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patient 3 with LQTS, two missense variants in the genes SCN5A and KCNQ were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, in patient 4 with LQTS a known missense variant was found in MYBPC3 which usually is mutated in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that multiplex targeted High-Throughput-Sequencing works as an efficient and cost-effective tool for molecular diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disorders in clinical practice and offers new insights in the pathogenesis of these complex diseases </plain></SENT>
