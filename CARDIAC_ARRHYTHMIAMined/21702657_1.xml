<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although these athletes often report symptoms while exercising, they seldom have symptoms at rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, compared with nonathletic asthmatic individuals, elite athletes have been shown to have a different distribution of airway <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and unequal response to bronchial provocative test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Elite athletes display signs of exercise-induced symptoms, for example, nonasthmatic inspiratory wheeze, vocal cord dysfunction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, which could limit their physical capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elite athletes should undergo comprehensive assessment to confirm an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> diagnosis and determine its degree of severity </plain></SENT>
