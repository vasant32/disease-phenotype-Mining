<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The occurrence of drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in safety pharmacology or toxicology studies is a primary safety concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The risk assessment requires an accurate knowledge of background <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> incidence and frequency in the test system/species, as well as a rigorous evaluation of the effects of the potential new medical entities on the electrocardiogram (ECG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the direct assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in ECG recordings is a time-consuming effort and is rarely achieved due to lack of suitable automated tools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A new software application named ARR30a was developed for fast automated detection in preclinical studies, for the five major <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> types, namely sinus pauses, atrial beats, junctional beats, ventricular beats and type 2 atrio-ventricular blocks (<z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV-blocks</z:mp> II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to characterize the performance of ARR30a in large and small animal species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Detection sensitivity and predictivity were evaluated on a database of 84 ECG recordings representative of each animal species and experimental protocols typically used in efficacy, safety pharmacology and toxicology studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Automated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> detection was compared with manual analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In large animals such as dogs, non-human primates and pigs, ARR30a sensitivity reached 90.6%, 82.2% and 78.0% for ventricular beats, <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV-blocks</z:mp> II and junctional beats with predictivity of 83.4%, 94.4% and 93.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significantly lower sensitivity was observed in rats for junctional beats due to challenging problems of detection for low amplitude P-waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Robustness to noise was assessed by adding increasing noise levels to ECG signals and showed no significant impact on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> detection at moderate noise levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Processing time for a 24 hour recording was approximately 4 min for dogs and 6 min for rats on a 3 GHz processor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: This newly validated ECG <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> detector ARR30a allows evaluating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> major ECG signal abnormalities and enhances the quantification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> incidence in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> major laboratory animal species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mark editor RME10a enables manual validation of the automated analysis and refinement of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> classification </plain></SENT>
