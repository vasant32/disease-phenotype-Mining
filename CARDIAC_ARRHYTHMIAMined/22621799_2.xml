<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In experimental models, the combination of ranolazine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> has marked synergistic effects that potently suppress AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently, the clinical effect of the ranolazine-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> combination for the conversion of AF is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This prospective randomized pilot study compared the safety and efficacy of ranolazine plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> alone for the conversion of recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We enrolled 51 consecutive patients with AF (&lt;48-hour duration) eligible for pharmacologic cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients (33 men, 63 ± 8 years of age) were randomized to intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> for 24 hours (group A, n = 26) or to intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> plus oral ranolazine 1,500 mg at time of randomization (group A + R, n = 25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 2 groups were well balanced with respect to clinical characteristics and left atrial diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversion within 24 hours (primary end point) was achieved in 22 patients (88%) in group A + R versus 17 patients (65%) in group A (p = 0.056) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Time to conversion was shorter in group A + R than in group A (9.8 ± 4.1 vs 14.6 ± 5.3 hours, p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>According to Cox regression analysis, left atrial diameter and A + R treatment were the only independent predictors of time to conversion (hazard ratio 5.35, 95% confidence interval 2.37 to 12.11, p &lt;0.001; hazard ratio 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.74 to 0.88, p &lt;0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no proarrhythmic events in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, addition of ranolazine to standard <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> therapy is equally safe and appears to be more effective compared to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> alone for conversion of recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF </plain></SENT>
