<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Aims Development of a human cell-derived reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> model is needed for studying the mechanisms of disease and accurate drug response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods and results We differentiated human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into cardiomyocytes, and then re-plated them into cell sheets that proved capable of forming electrically coupled assemblies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We monitored the function of these re-plated sheets optically with the Ca(2+) sensitive dye <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51103">Fluo-4</z:chebi>, and found that they generated characteristic waves of activity whose velocity and patterns of propagation depended upon the concentration of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel blockers; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="9506">tetrodotoxin</z:chebi>, and also the time after re-plating, as well as the applied stimulation frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Importantly, reentrant spiral-wave propagation could be generated in these sheets by applying high-frequency stimulation, particularly when cell-density in the sheets was relatively low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was because cardiac troponin T-positive cells were more non-homogeneously distributed at low cell densities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Especially in such sheets, we could terminate spiral waves by administering the anti-arrhythmic drugs; nifekalant, E-4031, sotalol, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also found that in these sheets, nifekalant showed a clear dose-dependent increase in the size of the unexcitable 'cores' of these induced spiral waves, an important parallel with the treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> in the clinical situation, which was not shown properly in cardiac-cell sheets derived from dissociated rodent hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusions We have succeeded in creating from hPSCs a valuable type of cardiomyocyte sheet that is capable of generating reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and thus is demonstrably useful for screening and testing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sorts of drugs with anti-arrhythmic potential </plain></SENT>
