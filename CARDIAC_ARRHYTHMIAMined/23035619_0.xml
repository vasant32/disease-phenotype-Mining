<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Red cell distribution width (RDW) has been associated with poor outcomes in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the role of RDW in prediction of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the relation between the RDW and postoperative AF in patients undergoing CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 132 patients undergoing nonemergency CABG were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with previous atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> or requiring concomitant valve surgery were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed 132 consecutive patients (mean age, 60.55 ± 9.5 years; 99 male and 33 female) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The RDW level was determined preoperatively and on postoperative Day 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Preoperative RDW levels were significantly higher in patients who developed AF than in those who did not (13.9 ± 1.4 vs. 13.3 ± 1.2, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was not any correlation between postoperative RDW levels and AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Using a cutpoint of 13.45, the preoperative level correlated with the incidence of AF with a sensitivity of 61% and specificity of 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Preoperative RDW level predicts new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF after CABG in patients without histories of AF </plain></SENT>
