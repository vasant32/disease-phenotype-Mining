<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that incomplete <z:hpo ids='HP_0011712'>right bundle branch block</z:hpo> (IRBBB) would be associated with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> lone AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a case-control study comparing electrocardiographic (ECG) markers from patients with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> lone AF and from a healthy control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We included 187 patients with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> lone AF and 383 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two lone AF patients were excluded from the study because of AF at the time of enrolment or because of the use of antiarrhythmic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the remaining 125 patients with paroxysmal or persistent lone AF (84% males, mean age 37), controls were matched on a 1:1 basis on the parameters gender and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher proportion of the lone AF population had an IRBBB compared with the subjects in the control group (33.6 vs. 10.4%; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis adjusted for conventional risk factors, IRBBB was strongly associated with lone AF [odds ratio (OR) 5.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.30-13.02; P&lt;0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lone AF patients had a significantly longer PR interval than the control group (175.1 vs. 160.9 ms; P&lt;0.001), but in multivariable analysis, every 10 ms increase in the PR interval was only borderline significantly associated with an OR of 1.15 (95% CI 0.99-1.32; P=0.060) for lone AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We are the first to report that IRBBB is strongly and independently associated with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> lone AF </plain></SENT>
