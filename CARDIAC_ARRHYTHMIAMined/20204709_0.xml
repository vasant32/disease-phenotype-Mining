<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conduction velocity restitution is the simplest non-trivial spatially extended problem in excitable media, and in the case of cardiac tissue it is an important tool for prediction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An idealized conduction velocity restitution curve requires solving a non-linear eigenvalue problem with periodic boundary conditions, which in the cardiac case is very stiff and calls for the use of asymptotic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compare asymptotics of restitution curves in four examples, two generic excitable media models, and two ionic cardiac models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The generic models include the classical FitzHugh-Nagumo model and its variation by Barkley </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They are treated with standard singular perturbation techniques </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The Caricature Noble model is considered with particular care to demonstrate the well-posedness of the corresponding boundary-value problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The developed method for calculation of conduction velocity restitution is then applied to the Beeler-Reuter model </plain></SENT>
