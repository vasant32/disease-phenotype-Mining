<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Transcatheter closure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001643'>patent ductus arteriosus</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp>) is a well established procedure and an accepted treatment modality for small to moderate-sized <z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to evaluate the immediate and follow-up results of transcatheter closure of large <z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDAs</z:mp> with severe pulmonary arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="11" ids="104011,31204,33848,53305">PAH</z:chebi>) in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After a complete hemodynamic evaluation differentiating from the reversibility of severe <z:chebi fb="11" ids="104011,31204,33848,53305">PAH</z:chebi>, transcatheter closure of <z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp> was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up clinically and echocardiographically at 24 hours, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients had successful occlusion, pulmonary artery pressure (<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and fractional shortening (FS) significantly decreased immediately after occlusion ((106 ± 25) mmHg vs. (50 ± 14) mmHg, P &lt; 0.01; (63.7 ± 7.2)% vs. (51.4 ± 10.1)%, P &lt; 0.01 and (36.9 ± 8.2)% vs. (28.9 ± 8.6)%, P &lt; 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 1 month after <z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp> closure, the signs and symptoms improved markedly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 29 patients, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDAs</z:mp> were completely closed and remained closed during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients having different degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor</z:chebi> (ACEI) and/or digoxin after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine patients whose pulmonary vascular resistence (PVR) &gt; 6 Wood units accepted targeted <z:chebi fb="11" ids="104011,31204,33848,53305">PAH</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 1 to 3 months of peroral drug therapy, their exercise tolerance improved from New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV to NYHA class I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, no latent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were found, the left atrial diameter (LAD), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD), left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.05), and FS and LVEF recovered compared to the immediate postclosure state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, FS and LVEF remained low compared to the preclosure state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter closure of large <z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp> with severe <z:chebi fb="11" ids="104011,31204,33848,53305">PAH</z:chebi> is feasible, effective, and safe in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Significant left ventricular systolic changes may occur after closure of large <z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp>, and left ventricular function usually recovers within a few months </plain></SENT>
