<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the risk:benefit ratios between prophylactic radiofrequency ablation and no treatment in asymptomatic patients with WPW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Decision analysis software was used to construct a risk-benefit decision tree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The target population consisted of 20- to 40-year-old asymptomatic patients with WPW without structural fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> or a family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline estimates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> and radiofrequency ablation complication rates were obtained from the literature, an empirical data survey, and expert opinion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The outcome measure was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analyses determined the variables that significantly impacted the decision to ablate or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Threshold analyses evaluated the effects of key variables and the optimum policy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At baseline, the decision to ablate resulted in a reduction of mortality risk of 8.8 patients for 1000 patients compared with abstention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is necessary to treat 112 asymptomatic patients with WPW to save one life over 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analysis showed that 3 variables significantly impacted the decision to ablate: (1) complication of radiofrequency ablation, (2) success of radiofrequency ablation, and (3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in asymptomatic patients with WPW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a decision aid for treating asymptomatic patients with the WPW ECG pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Using the model and the population we tested, prophylactic catheter ablation is not yet ready for widespread clinical use </plain></SENT>
