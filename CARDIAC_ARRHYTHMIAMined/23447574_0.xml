<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ablation targeted low-voltage bridges (LVBs) within the CTI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Repeat maps were obtained following ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group 2 (operators 2, 3, and 4 n = 35) utilized electroanatomic navigation and ablated by the creation of linear lesions from the tricuspid valve to the inferior vena cava </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demonstration of bidirectional block (BDB) was required in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LVB were associated with CTI conduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Group A patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LVB ablation terminated flutter, or created BDB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following ablation, CTI voltage connections were absent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with Group B, Group A had less radiofrequency (RF) lesions to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (AFL) termination (P = 0.001), less total RF lesions (P = 0.0001), and less total RF time (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Group 1 had no recurrent AFL whereas Group 2 had three recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(follow-up median of 231 Â± 181 days).CONCLUSION: (i) Voltage gradient mapping visualized regions of critical CTI conduction, (ii) ablation of LVB terminated AFL and resulted in BDB, (iii) repeat mapping confirmed the absence of trans-isthmus voltage, and (iv) Compared with standard ablation, voltage gradient mapping decreases total RF lesions, lesions to AFL termination, and total RF time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Use of voltage gradient mapping can facilitate successful AFL ablation </plain></SENT>
