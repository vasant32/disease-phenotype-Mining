<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) may involve video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for mediastinal esophageal dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Usually, VATS requires single-lung ventilation and has associated cardiopulmonary morbidity [1-3] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, transhiatal dissection can be performed, although its complications include <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042928" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vocal cord palsy</z:e> [4], cardiac arrythmias [5], and increased <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> [5, 6], the latter associated with mortality after esophagectomy [2] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the feasibility of MIE using transcervical videoscopic esophageal dissection (TVED) in swine was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A simultaneous laparoscopic and TVED approach may decrease operative time and blood loss while improving visualization and avoiding single-lung ventilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two pigs (Sus domesticus) underwent two similar procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The methods were approved by the authors' Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (no </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A24209) under United States Department of Agriculture guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Steps included a cervical incision to accommodate a modified hand-assist access device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cervical esophagus was dissected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Trocars were placed through the modified access device, and pneumomediastinum was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The tracheoesophageal plane was dissected into the thorax and beyond the mid esophagus, on which the pleura of the separate mediastinal compartment inserts itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Vagal nerves were identified and divided distal to recurrent branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Standard laparoscopic techniques were used for esophagogastric dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>After specimen extraction, the animals were euthanized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A full circumferential dissection of the mediastinal esophagus was successfully accomplished in two animals using a single-incision TVED for MIE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A novel technique for mediastinal esophageal dissection using a TVED approach performed with instruments designed for single-port surgery is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Fortunately, the human lacks the swine's separate mediastinal compartment, and this unique difference should facilitate the human version of this dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This approach may avoid the potential morbidity of VATS while providing better visualization and facilitating dissection of the upper mediastinal esophagus compared with either the transhiatal approach or the previously attempted rigid mediastinoscopic approaches [7-9] </plain></SENT>
