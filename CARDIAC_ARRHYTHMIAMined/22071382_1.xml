<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether women and minorities are as likely as white men to receive an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> for primary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We reviewed the electronic medical records of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> by nuclear single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography imaging (EF ≤ 35%), who had no prior history of sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical and demographic data were collected and the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was calculated for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 233 non-selected patients (age = 68 ± 12 years, 29% women, 21% black, EF 24 ± 6%, CCI 6.62 ± 2.9) were included in this analysis of whom 111 (48%) received an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> recipients were more likely to be Caucasian men compared with black men or women from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> races </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for race, gender, EF, and the CCI in a multivariate logistic regression model, women were 61% less likely than men [odds ratio (OR) = 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20-0.74, P= 0.004] and blacks were 72% less likely than whites (OR = 0.28, 95% CI 0.13-0.59, P= 0.001) to receive an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Even after adjusting for comorbid conditions, gender, and racial discrepancies in the implantation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> for the primary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further investigations into the root causes of these discrepancies are needed before any corrective measures can be adopted </plain></SENT>
