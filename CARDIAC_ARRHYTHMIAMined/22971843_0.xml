<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cibenzoline inhibited the bi-directional I(NCX) in a concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The IC(50) values of cibenzoline for the outward and inward components of I(NCX) were 77 and 84 Î¼M, respectively, with Hill coefficients of 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracellular application of trypsin via the pipette solution did not change the inhibitory effect of cibenzoline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effect of cibenzoline on I(NCX) at pH(o) 6.5 was smaller than those at pH(o) 7.4 and pH(o) 8.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that cibenzoline inhibits I(NCX) in supra-therapeutic concentrations </plain></SENT>
