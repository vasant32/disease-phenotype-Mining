<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report the trends, safety, and efficacy of epicardial mapping and ablation at a single center over an 8-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients referred for VT ablation (June 2004 to July 2011) were divided into 3 groups: ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ICM), nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (NICM), and idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (VA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with scar-mediated VT who underwent combined epicardial and endocardial (epi-endo) mapping and ablation were compared with those who underwent endocardial-only (endo-only) ablation with regard to patient characteristics, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> procedural success, 6- and 12-month clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 144 patients referred for VT ablation, 95 patients underwent 109 epicardial procedures (94% access rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Major complications were seen in 8 patients (8.8%) with pericardial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (&gt;80 cm(3)) in 6 cases (6.7%), although no tamponade, surgical intervention, or procedural mortality was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with ICM who underwent a combined epi-endo ablation had improved freedom from VT compared with those who underwent endo-only ablation at 12 months (85% vs 56%; P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with NICM, no differences were seen between those who underwent epi-endo ablation and those who underwent endo-only ablation at 12 months (36% vs 33%; P = 1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In idiopathic VA, only 2 of 17 patients were successfully ablated from the epicardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this large tertiary single-center experience, complication rates are acceptably low and improved clinical outcomes were associated with epi-endo ablation in patients with ICM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with NICM represent a growing referred population, although clinical recurrence remains high despite epicardial ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Epicardial ablation has a low yield in idiopathic VA </plain></SENT>
