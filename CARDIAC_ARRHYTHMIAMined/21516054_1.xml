<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A tertiary care pediatric hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Patients younger than 1 yr supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> were identified from the institutional extracorporeal membrane oxygenation registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Clinical characteristics and outcomes were investigated for patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcomes investigated were time from initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> control, duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, and results of interventions performed while supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We summarized the independent categorical and continuous variables using frequencies, percentages, and medians and ranges, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support was used in nine patients for rescue therapy for primary tachyarrhythmia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were: focal atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (n = 2); reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (n = 3); <z:hpo ids='HP_0011716'>junctional ectopic tachycardia</z:hpo> (n = 2); and congenital complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> (n = 2) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seven patients presented with severe hemodynamic compromise, with six patients requiring extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation within 24 hrs of initial presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Balloon atrial septostomy was performed in three patients and ablation was performed in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Sinus rhythm was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> and rate control was established in both patients with focal atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> and in one patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011716'>junctional ectopic tachycardia</z:hpo> while using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients survived to hospital discharge, and median follow-up for the cohort was 5 yrs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was one late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> survivors had good overall and neurologic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The requirement of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support in newborns and infants with intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support does potentially carry morbidity; however, to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-related mortality, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support and/or extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be considered in the management of hemodynamically unstable primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> as an emergent lifesaving procedure </plain></SENT>
