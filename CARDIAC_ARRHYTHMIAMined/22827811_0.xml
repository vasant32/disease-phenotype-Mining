<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Three academic and six non-academic teaching hospitals in the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>POPULATION: Labouring women with a high-risk singleton pregnancy in cephalic position beyond 36 weeks of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 142 women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (≥38.0°C) during labour and 141 women with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> temperature who had been included in two previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both groups, we counted the number and type of ST-events and classified them as significant (intervention needed) or not significant, based on STAN(®) clinical guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number and type of ST-events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both univariable and multivariable regression analysis showed no association between the presence of maternal intrapartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and the number or type of ST-events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Maternal intrapartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> is not associated with ST-segment changes of the fetal electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interpretation of ST-changes in labouring women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> should therefore not differ from other situations </plain></SENT>
