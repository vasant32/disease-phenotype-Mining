<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the effects of TWBCP supplemented with high-dose olprinone, which is a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50568">phosphodiesterase III inhibitor</z:chebi>, a clinically available compound with the potential to reduce oxidant stress and calcium overload </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effects with respect to avoiding oxidant-mediated myocardial reperfusion injury and prompt functional recovery after prolonged single-dose crystalloid cardioplegic arrest in a infantile piglet cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen piglets were subjected to 90 min of cardioplegic arrest on CPB, followed by 30 min of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In group I, uncontrolled reperfusion was applied without receiving TWBCP; in group II, TWBCP was given; in group III, TWBCP was supplemented with olprinone (3 μg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Myocardial performance was evaluated before and after CPB by a left ventricular (LV) function curve and pressure-volume loop analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biochemical injury was determined by measurements of troponin-T and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxide</z:chebi> (LPO) in coronary sinus blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Group III showed significant LV performance recovery (group I, 26.5% ± 5.1%; group II, 42.9% ± 10.8%; group III, 81.9% ± 24.5%, P &lt; 0.01 vs. groups I and II), associated with significant reduction of troponin-T and LPO at the reperfusion phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No piglets in group III needed electrical cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We concluded that TWBCP with olprinone reduces myocardial reperfusion injury by reducing oxidant-mediated <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, and it accelerates prompt and persistent LV functional recovery with suppression of reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
