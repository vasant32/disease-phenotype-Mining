<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Electrolytes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">acid-base disorders</z:e> are common challenges seen in the intensive care unit (ICU) resulting in difficulty in weaning patients off the ventilator, prolonged admission periods, preventable <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These require prompt lab results most of which are done serially, ideally a point of care test (POCT), as most central hospital lab result's turnaround time (TAT) sometimes might not meet up with the urgency of clinical decision making in the ICU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of electrolytes and acid-base abnormalities using i-Stat portable analysers in the ICU of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The i-STAT Portable Clinical Analyzer, a POCT system consisting of a hand-held analyzer and single-use cartridges that measure different panels of analytes in 65-100 microl of blood using an EC8+ cartridge type analyzer for <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, pH, blood gases [TCO2, pO2, pCO2]) and heamatocrit was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over 66.78% of the patients had multiple electrolytes and acid-base abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002157'>Azotemia</z:hpo> in 20%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> in 13.33%, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> in 53.33% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: it is concluded from this study that electrolyte and acid base abnormalities is not uncommon in the intensive care unit of LUTH and the i-STAT Portable Clinical Analyzer was helpful in facilitating early diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
