<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Coffee and <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> are widely consumed in Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little information is available on the influence of coffee and <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> consumption on <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) in hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to investigate the relationship between coffee consumption and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> with regard to spontaneous conversion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A group of 600 patients presenting with a first known episode of AF was investigated, and we identified 247 hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of nutritional parameters was assessed with a food frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Coffee and <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> intake were specifically estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>Left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> was evaluated by electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Coffee consumption was higher in normotensive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High coffee consumers were more frequent in normotensive patients compared with hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the intake of <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> was similar in hypertensive and normotensive patients, owing to a higher intake in hypertensive patients from sources other than coffee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Within normotensive patients, we report that non-habitual and low coffee consumers showed the highest probability of spontaneous conversion (OR 1.93 95%CI 0.88-3.23; p=0.001), whereas, within hypertensive patients, moderate but not high coffee consumers had the lowest probability of spontaneous conversion (OR 1.13 95%CI 0.67-1.99; p=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Coffee and <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> consumption influence spontaneous conversion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Normotensive non-habitual coffee consumers are more likely to convert <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> within 48h from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Hypertensive patients showed a U-shaped relationship between coffee consumption and spontaneous conversion of AF, moderate coffee consumers were less likely to show spontaneous conversion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> showed a reduced rate of spontaneous conversion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
