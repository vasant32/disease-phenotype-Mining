<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some animal models of LVH display specific alterations of the myocardial interstitium that could increase myocardial vulnerability to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, but these merit evaluation in humans with LVH and SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Twelve consecutive patients with isolated LVH and SCD (LVH+SCD) in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo>, or other cardiac structural abnormality were ascertained in the Oregon Sudden Unexpected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Detailed postmortem comparisons were conducted with 18 controls who had isolated LVH and unnatural <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (Control Group A) and 6 controls who had structurally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearts and unnatural <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (Control Group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postmortem left ventricular myocardial sections were obtained for measurement of collagen volume fraction, characterization of gap junctions, and quantification of collagen subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Heart weight normalized to body weight was higher in LVH+SCD cases (6.9±1.2 g/kg) than in Control Group A (5.3±1.4 g/kg) and Control Group B (4.2±0.3 g/kg); P=0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Collagen volume fraction was also higher in LVH+SCD cases (3.1±0.4) than in Control Group A (2.3±0.4) and Control Group B (1.6±0.3); P=0.0002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relative amount of collagen III was significantly higher in LVH+SCD cases (33.0±4.4%) than in Control Group A (20.9±4.3%) and Control Group B (13.4±3.5%); P=0.0001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was an overall increase in the number of connexin 43-labeled gap junctions with increasing myocyte size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No subject was found to have high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the expected increase in myocardial mass and overall collagen content, SCD with isolated LVH was associated with relative abundance of type III collagen, a novel finding that warrants further mechanistic evaluation </plain></SENT>
