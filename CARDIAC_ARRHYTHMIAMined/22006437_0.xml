<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, exposure to ionizing radiation from fluoroscopy during the procedure is of concern to both patients and caregivers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to assess the impact of an impedance-based three-dimensional navigation system (NavX(TM), Endocardial Solutions, Inc., St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Paul, MN) on pediatric catheter ablation procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed procedural data during a 7-year period (2002-2008), which spanned the transition between standard fluoroscopic mapping and adoption of NavX(TM) mapping for catheter ablation of atrioventricular nodal reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AVNRT) and right/left-sided accessory pathways (RAP/LAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparisons of total procedure time, total fluoroscopy time, and ablation fluoroscopy time (from insertion of ablation catheter until completion of procedure) between NavX(TM) and conventional mapping were made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three hundred eighty-eight patients (aged 1-18 years, M/F 236:183) underwent ablation of AVNRT (n = 101), LAP (n = 130), or RAP (n = 157) using either conventional (n = 70) or NavX(TM) (n = 318) mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall success rates were similar between the two mapping approaches (95.7% for conventional versus 95.9% for NavX(TM)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NavX(TM) mapping significantly reduced ablation fluoroscopy time (15.9 ± 14.3 versus 11.0 ± 8.9 min for NavX(TM), p &lt; 0.01) with a trend towards a decrease in total fluoroscopy time (26.4 ± 15.6 versus 23.8 ± 11.1 min for NavX(TM), p = 0.095) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Total procedure time was not significantly different between the two methods (210.1 ± 66 versus 222.8 ± 61 min for NavX(TM), p = 0.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When analyzed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> substrate, there were significant reductions in ablation fluoroscopy time for both LAP and RAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: NavX(TM) mapping reduced ablation fluoroscopy times for accessory pathways during pediatric catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
