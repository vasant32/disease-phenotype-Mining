<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction disturbances are less investigated in hemodialysis patients and data about their prevalence are insufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular blocks</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011710'>bundle branch blocks</z:hpo> in hemodialysis patients and to analyze different clinical risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study included 140 patients on long-term hemodialysis treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular blocks</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011710'>bundle branch blocks</z:hpo> was determined by electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into groups depending on the presence or absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011710'>bundle branch blocks</z:hpo> and investigated variables were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was present in 11 (7.9%) of the 140 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, age and higher concentration of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011705'>first-degree atrioventricular block</z:hpo> was 2.9% (4 patients) and second- and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001709'>third-degree atrioventricular blocks</z:hpo> were not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011710'>bundle branch blocks</z:hpo> was 17.1% (24 patients): 5% of patients had a complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0011712'>right bundle branch block</z:hpo>, 6.4% had an incomplete <z:hpo ids='HP_0011712'>right bundle branch block</z:hpo>, 3.6% had a complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo> and 2.1% of patients had an incomplete <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was associated with older age and higher concentration of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
