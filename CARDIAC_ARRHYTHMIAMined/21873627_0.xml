<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The number of implanted cardiac rhythm devices has rapidly increased in the past decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the need for lead extraction has also increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several techniques of lead removal have been documented from manual traction of the lead to lead extraction assisted with mechanical or laser sheaths </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to review our experience with lead removal using manual traction without the assistance of extraction sheaths </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In the Leiden University Medical Center <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> leads are removed using manual traction without the assistance of extraction sheaths </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have retrospectively reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lead removal procedures performed between 2000 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Procedures were reviewed for indication, success, complication rates, and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In total, 279 lead removal procedures were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During these procedures 445 leads were removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Time since lead implantation: 4.2 Â± 4.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During extraction 53(11.9%) leads fractured, of which &gt;50% could still be completely removed using a femoral approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A longer implantation duration [odds ratio (OR) 1.16 per year, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-1.23] and passive fixation (OR 2.52, 95%CI 1.17-5.45) significantly associated with the chance of lead fracture during lead removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clinical success, using the primary approach of manual traction from the pectoral area, was obtained in 228 (84.8%) procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Major complications occurred in 2(0.7%) and minor in 13(4.7%) procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>One patient died within 24 h after the procedure due to septic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was no further mortality within the first month after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Lead removal using manual traction, without the assistance of lead extraction sheaths, is clinically successful in ~85% of the lead extraction procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Concomitant morbidity and mortality are low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The highest clinical success (~95%) was observed in patients with leads implanted less than 2.6 years </plain></SENT>
